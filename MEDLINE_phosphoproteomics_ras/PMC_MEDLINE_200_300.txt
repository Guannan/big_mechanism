TI  - Quantitative Proteomic profiling identifies protein correlates to EGFR kinase
      inhibition.
PG  - 1071-81
AB  - Clinical oncology is hampered by a lack of tools to accurately assess a patient’s
      response to pathway-targeted therapies. Serum and tumor cell surface proteins
      whose abundance, or change in abundance in response to therapy, differentiates
      patients responding to a therapy from patients not-responding to a therapy could 
      be usefully incorporated into tools for monitoring response. Here we posit and
      then verify that proteomic discovery in in vitro tissue culture models can
      identify proteins with concordant in vivo behavior and further, can be a valuable
      approach for identifying tumor-derived serum proteins. In this study we use
      Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids in Culture (SILAC) with proteomic
      technologies to quantitatively analyze the gefitinib-related protein changes in a
      model system for sensitivity to EGFR targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We
      identified 3,707 intracellular proteins, 1,276 cell surface proteins, and 879
      shed proteins. More than 75% of the proteins identified had quantitative
      information and a subset consisting of [400] proteins showed a statistically
      significant change in abundance following gefitinib treatment. We validated the
      change in expression profile in vitro and screened our panel of response markers 
      in an in vivo isogenic resistant model and demonstrated that these were markers
      of gefitinib response and not simply markers of phospho-EGFR downregulation. In
      doing so, we also were able to identify which proteins might be useful as markers
      for monitoring response and which proteins might be useful as markers for a
      priori prediction of response.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Analysis Reveals a Role for Serine and Threonine
      Kinases in the Cytoskeletal Reorganization in Early T Cell Receptor Activation in
      Human Primary T Cells*.
PG  - 171-86
AB  - Protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events play a primary role in
      regulation of almost all aspects of cell function including signal transduction, 
      cell cycle, or apoptosis. Thus far, T cell phosphoproteomics have focused on
      analysis of phosphotyrosine residues, and little is known about the role of
      serine/threonine phosphorylation in early activation of the T cell receptor
      (TCR). Therefore, we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based analysis of
      the global phosphoproteome of human primary T cells in response to 5 min of TCR
      activation with anti-CD3 antibody. Combining immunoprecipitation with an
      antiphosphotyrosine antibody, titanium dioxide phosphopeptide enrichment,
      isobaric tag for the relative and absolute quantitation methodology, and strong
      cation exchange separation, we were able to identify 2814 phosphopeptides. These 
      unique sites were employed to investigate the site-specific phosphorylation
      dynamics. Five hundred and seventeen phosphorylation sites showed TCR-responsive 
      changes. We found that upon 5 min of stimulation of the TCR, specific serine and 
      threonine kinase motifs are overrepresented in the set of responsive
      phosphorylation sites. These phosphorylation events targeted proteins with many
      different activities and are present in different subcellular locations. Many of 
      these proteins are involved in intracellular signaling cascades related mainly to
      cytoskeletal reorganization and regulation of small GTPase-mediated signal
      transduction, probably involved in the formation of the immune synapse.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteome Profiling of Iron-Deficient Arabidopsis
      Roots1[C][W].
PG  - 403-17
AB  - Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient for plants, but often it is not
      available in sufficient quantities to sustain optimal growth. To gain insights
      into adaptive processes to low Fe availability at the posttranslational level, we
      conducted a quantitative analysis of Fe deficiency-induced changes in the
      phosphoproteome profile of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots. Isobaric
      tags for relative and absolute quantitation-labeled phosphopeptides were analyzed
      by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on an LTQ-Orbitrap with
      collision-induced dissociation and high-energy collision dissociation
      capabilities. Using a combination of titanium dioxide and immobilized metal
      affinity chromatography to enrich phosphopeptides, we extracted 849 uniquely
      identified phosphopeptides corresponding to 425 proteins and identified several
      not previously described phosphorylation motifs. A subset of 45 phosphoproteins
      was defined as being significantly changed in abundance upon Fe deficiency.
      Kinase motifs in Fe-responsive proteins matched to protein kinase A/calcium
      calmodulin-dependent kinase II, casein kinase II, and proline-directed kinase,
      indicating a possible critical function of these kinase classes in Fe
      homeostasis. To validate our analysis, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis on 
      IAA-CONJUGATE-RESISTANT4 (IAR4), a protein putatively functioning in auxin
      homeostasis. iar4 mutants showed compromised root hair formation and developed
      shorter primary roots. Changing serine-296 in IAR4 to alanine resulted in a
      phenotype intermediate between mutant and wild type, whereas acidic substitution 
      to aspartate to mimic phosphorylation was either lethal or caused an extreme
      dwarf phenotype, supporting the critical importance of this residue in Fe
      homeostasis. Our analyses further disclose substantial changes in the abundance
      of phosphoproteins involved in primary carbohydrate metabolism upon Fe
      deficiency, complementing the picture derived from previous proteomic and
      transcriptomic profiling studies.

TI  - High-throughput analysis of peptide binding modules.
PG  - 1527-46
AB  - Modular protein interaction domains that recognize linear peptide motifs are
      found in hundreds of proteins within the human genome. Some protein interaction
      domains such as SH2, 14-3-3, Chromo and Bromo domains serve to recognize
      post-translational modification of amino acids (such as phosphorylation,
      acetylation, methylation etc.) and translate these into discrete cellular
      responses. Other modules such as SH3 and PDZ domains recognize linear peptide
      epitopes and serve to organize protein complexes based on localization and
      regions of elevated concentration. In both cases, the ability to nucleate
      specific signaling complexes is in large part dependent on the selectivity of a
      given protein module for its cognate peptide ligand. High throughput analysis of 
      peptide-binding domains by peptide or protein arrays, phage display, mass
      spectrometry or other HTP techniques provides new insight into the potential
      protein-protein interactions prescribed by individual or even whole families of
      modules. Systems level analyses have also promoted a deeper understanding of the 
      underlying principles that govern selective protein-protein interactions and how 
      selectivity evolves. Lastly, there is a growing appreciation for the limitations 
      and potential pitfalls of high-throughput analysis of protein-peptide
      interactomes. This review will examine some of the common approaches utilized for
      large-scale studies of protein interaction domains and suggest a set of standards
      for the analysis and validation of datasets from large-scale studies of
      peptide-binding modules. We will also highlight how data from large-scale studies
      of modular interaction domain families can provide insight into systems level
      properties such as the linguistics of selective interactions.

TI  - Dynamic Reprogramming of the Kinome In Response to Targeted MEK Inhibition In
      Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
PG  - 307-21
AB  - Kinase inhibitors have limited success in cancer treatment because tumors
      circumvent their action. Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we assessed
      kinome activity in response to MEK inhibition in triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) cells and genetically engineered mice (GEMMs). MEK inhibition caused acute
      ERK activity loss, resulting in rapid c-Myc degradation that induced expression
      and activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RNAi knockdown of ERK
      or c-Myc mimicked RTK induction by MEK inhibitors, whereas prevention of
      proteasomal c-Myc degradation blocked kinome reprogramming. MEK inhibitor-induced
      RTK stimulation overcame MEK2 but not MEK1 inhibition, reactivating ERK and
      producing drug resistance. The C3Tag GEMM for TNBC similarly induced RTKs in
      response to MEK inhibition. The inhibitor-induced RTK profile suggested a kinase 
      inhibitor combination therapy that produced GEMM tumor apoptosis and regression
      where single agents were ineffective. This approach defines mechanisms of drug
      resistance, allowing rational design of combination therapies for cancer.

AB  - Background: Wnt signaling blocks adipocyte development and is implicated in
      diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.Results: Wnt stimulates insulin mediators via
      an insulin/IGF-1 receptor-dependent process; conversely, Wnt co-receptor LRP5 is 
      essential to normal insulin signaling in preadipocytes.Conclusion: Insulin and

TI  - c-Src and c-Abl kinases control hierarchic phosphorylation and function of the
      CagA effector protein in Western and East Asian Helicobacter pylori strains .
PG  - 1553-66
AB  - Many bacterial pathogens inject into host cells effector proteins that are
      substrates for host tyrosine kinases such as Src and Abl family kinases.
      Phosphorylated effectors eventually subvert host cell signaling, aiding disease
      development. In the case of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, which is a 
      major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, the only known effector 
      protein injected into host cells is the oncoprotein CagA. Here, we followed the
      hierarchic tyrosine phosphorylation of H. pylori CagA as a model system to study 
      early effector phosphorylation processes. Translocated CagA is phosphorylated on 
      Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motifs EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and EPIYA-C in Western
      strains of H. pylori and EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and EPIYA-D in East Asian strains. We 
      found that c-Src only phosphorylated EPIYA-C and EPIYA-D, whereas c-Abl
      phosphorylated EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, EPIYA-C, and EPIYA-D. Further analysis revealed 
      that CagA molecules were phosphorylated on 1 or 2 EPIYA motifs, but never
      simultaneously on 3 motifs. Furthermore, none of the phosphorylated EPIYA motifs 
      alone was sufficient for inducing AGS cell scattering and elongation. The
      preferred combination of phosphorylated EPIYA motifs in Western strains was
      EPIYA-A and EPIYA-C, either across 2 CagA molecules or simultaneously on 1. Our
      study thus identifies a tightly regulated hierarchic phosphorylation model for
      CagA starting at EPIYA-C/D, followed by phosphorylation of EPIYA-A or EPIYA-B.
      These results provide insight for clinical H. pylori typing and clarify the role 
      of phosphorylated bacterial effector proteins in pathogenesis.

TI  - Regulation of mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis through cell signaling:
      cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome c in ischemia/reperfusion injury and
      inflammation.
PG  - 598-609
AB  - Cytochrome c (Cytc) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) catalyze the terminal reaction
      of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), the reduction of oxygen to
      water. This irreversible step is highly regulated, as indicated by the presence
      of tissue-specific and developmentally expressed isoforms, allosteric regulation,
      and reversible phosphorylations, which are found in both Cytc and COX. The
      crucial role of the ETC in health and disease is obvious since it, together with 
      ATP synthase, provides the vast majority of cellular energy, which drives all
      cellular processes. However, under conditions of stress, the ETC generates
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause cell damage and trigger death
      processes. We here discuss current knowledge of the regulation of Cytc and COX
      with a focus on cell signaling pathways, including cAMP/protein kinase A and
      tyrosine kinase signaling. Based on the crystal structures we highlight all
      identified phosphorylation sites on Cytc and COX, and we present a new
      phosphorylation site, Ser126 on COX subunit II. We conclude with a model that
      links cell signaling with the phosphorylation state of Cytc and COX. This in turn
      regulates their enzymatic activities, the mitochondrial membrane potential, and
      the production of ATP and ROS. Our model is discussed through two distinct human 
      pathologies, acute inflammation as seen in sepsis, where phosphorylation leads to
      strong COX inhibition followed by energy depletion, and ischemia/reperfusion
      injury, where hyperactive ETC complexes generate pathologically high
      mitochondrial membrane potentials, leading to excessive ROS production. Although 
      operating at opposite poles of the ETC activity spectrum, both conditions can
      lead to cell death through energy deprivation or ROS-triggered apoptosis.

TI  - Host gene targets for novel influenza therapies elucidated by high-throughput RNA
      interference screens.
PG  - 1372-86
AB  - Influenza virus encodes only 11 viral proteins but replicates in a broad range of
      avian and mammalian species by exploiting host cell functions. Genome-wide RNA
      interference (RNAi) has proven to be a powerful tool for identifying the host
      molecules that participate in each step of virus replication. Meta-analysis of
      findings from genome-wide RNAi screens has shown influenza virus to be dependent 
      on functional nodes in host cell pathways, requiring a wide variety of molecules 
      and cellular proteins for replication. Because rapid evolution of the influenza A
      viruses persistently complicates the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics, 
      a further understanding of the complex host cell pathways coopted by influenza
      virus for replication may provide new targets and strategies for antiviral
      therapy. RNAi genome screening technologies together with bioinformatics can
      provide the ability to rapidly identify specific host factors involved in
      resistance and susceptibility to influenza virus, allowing for novel disease
      intervention strategies.—Meliopoulos, V. A., Andersen, L. E., Birrer, K. F.,

TI  - Identification of genes required for Cf-dependent hypersensitive cell death by
      combined proteomic and RNA interfering analyses.
PG  - 2421-35
AB  - Identification of hypersensitive cell death (HCD) regulators is essential to
      dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying plant disease resistance. In this
      study, combined proteomic and RNA interfering (RNAi) analyses were employed to
      identify genes required for the HCD conferred by the tomato resistance gene Cf-4 
      and the Cladosporium fulvum avirulence gene Avr4. Forty-nine proteins
      differentially expressed in the tomato seedlings mounting and those not mounting 
      Cf-4/Avr4-dependent HCD were identified through proteomic analysis. Among them
      were a variety of defence-related proteins including a cysteine protease, Pip1,
      an operative target of another C. fulvum effector, Avr2. Additionally,
      glutathione-mediated antioxidation is a major response to Cf-4/Avr4-dependent
      HCD. Functional analysis through tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing and 
      transient RNAi assays of the chosen 16 differentially expressed proteins revealed
      that seven genes, which encode Pip1 homologue NbPip1, a SIPK type MAP kinase
      Nbf4, an asparagine synthetase NbAsn, a trypsin inhibitor LeMir-like protein
      NbMir, a small GTP-binding protein, a late embryogenesis-like protein, and an
      ASR4-like protein, were required for Cf-4/Avr4-dependent HCD. Furthermore, the
      former four genes were essential for Cf-9/Avr9-dependent HCD; NbPip1, NbAsn, and 
      NbMir, but not Nbf4, affected a nonadaptive bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae
      pv. oryzae-induced HCD in Nicotiana benthamiana. These data demonstrate that Pip1
      and LeMir may play a general role in HCD and plant immunity and that the
      application of combined proteomic and RNA interfering analyses is an efficient
      strategy to identify genes required for HCD, disease resistance, and probably
      other biological processes in plants.

TI  - Proteome Dataset of Human Gingival Crevicular Fluid from Healthy Periodontium
      Sites by Multi-Dimensional Protein Separation and Mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 248-62
AB  - Background and Objective: Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) has been of major
      interest for many decades as valuable body fluid that may serve as a source of
      biomarkers for both periodontal and systemic diseases. Because of its very small 
      sample size, sub-μl level, identification of its protein composition by classical
      biochemical methods has been limited. The advent of highly sensitive mass
      spectrometric technology has permitted large-scale identification of protein
      components of many biological samples. This technology has been employed to
      identify protein composition of GCF from inflamed and periodontal sites. In this 
      report we present a proteome dataset of GCF from healthy periodontium sites.
      Methods: A combination of periopaper collection method with application of
      multidimensional protein separation and mass spectrometric (MS) technology led to
      a large-scale documentation of the proteome of GCF from healthy periodontium
      sites. Results: The approaches utilized have culminated in identification of 199 
      proteins in GCF of periodontally healthy sites. The current GCF proteome from
      healthy sites was compared and contrasted with those proteomes of GCF from
      inflamed and periodontal sites as well as serum. The cross-correlation of the GCF
      and plasma proteomes permitted dissociation of the 199 identified GCF proteins
      into, 105 proteins (57%) that can be identified in plasma and 94 proteins (43%)
      which are distinct and unique to GCF microenvironment. Such analysis also
      revealed distinctions in protein functional categories between serum proteins and
      those specific to GCF microenvironment. Conclusion: Firstly, the data presented
      herein provide the proteome of GCF from periodontally healthy sites through
      establishment of innovative analytical approaches for effective analysis of GCF
      from periopapers both at the level of complete elusion and removal of abundant
      albumin which restricts identification of low abundant proteins. Secondly, it
      adds significantly to the knowledge of GCF composition and highlights new groups 
      of proteins specific to GCF microenvironment.

TI  - PHOSPHOPROTEOMIC STUDIES OF RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASES: FUTURE PERSPECTIVES.
PG  - 1100-7
AB  - In the last decade, large-scale mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic studies 
      of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have generated a compendium of signalling
      networks that are activated downstream of these receptors. In this article, a
      brief summary of previous phosphoproteomic studies on Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor (EGFR) signalling will be presented together with a perspective on the
      importance for the field to keep pace with new advances in RTK biology. Using
      examples drawn primarily from studies on the EGFR, c-Met and Flt3 receptors,
      areas in RTK biology which will greatly benefit from the power of
      phosphoproteomics will be discussed, including a. validating oncogenic RTK
      mutants identified in cancer genome sequencing efforts, b. spatial RTK signalling
      networks and c. understanding crosstalk and co-activation between members of the 
      RTK superfamily.

TI  - Chemical genetic identification of NDR1/2 kinase substrates AAK1 and Rabin8
      uncovers their roles in controlling dendrite arborization and spine development.
PG  - 1127-42
AB  - Dendrite arborization and synapse formation are essential for wiring the neural
      circuitry. The evolutionarily conserved NDR1/2 kinase pathway, important for
      polarized growth from yeast to mammals, controls dendrite growth and morphology
      in worm and fly. Whether NDR1/2 kinases regulate dendrite and synapse development
      in mammals was not known. Nor have their phosphorylation targets been identified.
      Here we show that expression of dominant negative (kinase dead) NDR1/2 mutants or
      siRNA increase dendrite length and proximal branching of mammalian pyramidal
      neurons in cultures and in vivo, whereas expression of constitutively active
      NDR1/2 has the opposite effects. Moreover, NDR1/2 contributes to dendritic spine 
      development and excitatory synaptic function. We further employed chemical
      genetics and identified NDR1/2 substrates in the brain, including two proteins
      involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking: AAK1 (AP-2 associated kinase) and 
      Rabin8, a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) of Rab8 GTPase. We finally show that AAK1
      contributes to dendrite growth regulation and Rabin8 regulates spine development.

TI  - The Yeast Nuclear Pore Complex and Transport Through It.
PG  - 855-83
AB  - Exchange of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm is a key regulatory 
      event in the expression of a cell’s genome. This exchange requires a dedicated
      transport system: (1) nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), embedded in the nuclear
      envelope and composed of proteins termed nucleoporins (or “Nups”), and (2)
      nuclear transport factors that recognize the cargoes to be transported and ferry 
      them across the NPCs. This transport is regulated at multiple levels, and the NPC
      itself also plays a key regulatory role in gene expression by influencing nuclear
      architecture and acting as a point of control for various nuclear processes. Here
      we summarize how the yeast Saccharomyces has been used extensively as a model
      system to understand the fundamental and highly conserved features of this
      transport system, revealing the structure and function of the NPC; the NPC’s role
      in the regulation of gene expression; and the interactions of transport factors
      with their cargoes, regulatory factors, and specific nucleoporins.

TI  - Identification of Autophagosome-associated Proteins and Regulators by
      Quantitative Proteomic Analysis and Genetic Screens*.
LID - M111.014035
AB  - Autophagy is one of the major intracellular catabolic pathways, but little is
      known about the composition of autophagosomes. To study the associated proteins, 
      we isolated autophagosomes from human breast cancer cells using two different
      biochemical methods and three stimulus types: amino acid deprivation or rapamycin
      or concanamycin A treatment. The autophagosome-associated proteins were dependent
      on stimulus, but a core set of proteins was stimulus-independent. Remarkably,
      proteasomal proteins were abundant among the stimulus-independent common
      autophagosome-associated proteins, and the activation of autophagy significantly 
      decreased the cellular proteasome level and activity supporting interplay between
      the two degradation pathways. A screen of yeast strains defective in the
      orthologs of the human genes encoding for a common set of
      autophagosome-associated proteins revealed several regulators of autophagy,
      including subunits of the retromer complex. The combined spatiotemporal proteomic
      and genetic data sets presented here provide a basis for further characterization
      of autophagosome biogenesis and cargo selection.

TI  - Regulation of Protein Kinase D1 Activity.
PG  - 284-91
AB  - Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is a stress-activated serine/threonine kinase that plays
      a vital role in various physiologically important biological processes, including
      cell growth, apoptosis, adhesion, motility, and angiogenesis. Dysregulated PKD1
      expression also contributes to the pathogenesis of certain cancers and
      cardiovascular disorders. Studies to date have focused primarily on the canonical
      membrane-delimited pathway for PKD1 activation by G protein-coupled receptors or 
      peptide growth factors. Here, agonist-dependent increases in diacylglycerol
      accumulation lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC-dependent
      phosphorylation of PKD1 at two highly conserved serine residues in the activation
      loop; this modification increases PKD1 catalytic activity, as assessed by PKD1
      autophosphorylation at a consensus phosphorylation motif at the extreme C
      terminus. However, recent studies expose additional controls and consequences for
      PKD1 activation loop and C-terminal phosphorylation as well as additional
      autophosphorylation reactions and trans-phosphorylations (by PKC and other
      cellular enzymes) that contribute to the spatiotemporal control of PKD1 signaling
      in cells. This review focuses on the multisite phosphorylations that are known or
      predicted to influence PKD1 catalytic activity and may also influence docking
      interactions with cellular scaffolds and trafficking to signaling microdomains in
      various subcellular compartments. These modifications represent novel targets for
      the development of PKD1-directed pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancers and
      cardiovascular disorders.

TI  - STK33 kinase inhibitor BRD-8899 has no effect on KRAS-dependent cancer cell
      viability.
PG  - 2860-5
AB  - Approximately 30% of human cancers harbor oncogenic gain-of-function mutations in
      KRAS. Despite interest in KRAS as a therapeutic target, direct blockade of KRAS
      function with small molecules has yet to be demonstrated. Based on experiments
      that lower mRNA levels of protein kinases, KRAS-dependent cancer cells were
      proposed to have a unique requirement for the serine/threonine kinase STK33.
      Thus, it was suggested that small-molecule inhibitors of STK33 might have
      therapeutic benefit in these cancers. Here, we describe the development of
      selective, low nanomolar inhibitors of STK33’s kinase activity. The most potent
      and selective of these, BRD8899, failed to kill KRAS-dependent cells. While
      several explanations for this result exist, our data are most consistent with the
      view that inhibition of STK33’s kinase activity does not represent a promising
      anti-KRAS therapeutic strategy.

      cultured primary neurons.
PG  - 1341-53
AB  - Terminally differentiated primary cells represent a valuable in vitro model to
      study signaling events associated within a specific tissue. Quantitative
      proteomic methods using metabolic labeling in primary cells encounter labeling
      efficiency issues hindering the use of these cells. Here we developed a method to
      quantify the proteome and phosphoproteome of cultured neurons using 15N labeled
      brain tissue as an internal standard, and applied this method to determine how an
      inhibitor of an excitatory neural transmitter receptor, phencyclidine (PCP),
      affects the global phosphoproteome of cortical neurons. We identified over 10,000
      phosphopeptides and made accurate quantitative measurements of the neuronal
      phosphoproteome after neuronal inhibition. We show that short PCP treatments lead
      to changes in phosphorylation for 7% of neuronal phosphopeptides and that
      prolonged PCP treatment alters the total levels of several proteins essential for
      synaptic transmission and plasticity and leads to a massive reduction in the
      synaptic strength of inhibitory synapses. The results provide valuable insights
      into the dynamics of molecular networks implicated in PCP-mediated NMDA receptor 
      inhibition and sensorimotor deficits.

TI  - Erythrocyte plasma membrane–bound ERK1/2 activation promotes ICAM-4–mediated
      sickle red cell adhesion to endothelium.
PG  - 1217-27
AB  - The core pathology of sickle cell disease (SCD) starts with the erythrocyte
      (RBC). Aberration in MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling, which can regulate cell adhesion,
      occurs in diverse pathologies. Because RBCs contain abundant ERK1/2, we predicted
      that ERK1/2 is functional in sickle (SS) RBCs and promotes adherence, a hallmark 
      of SCD. ERK1/2 remained active in SS but not normal RBCs. β2-adrenergic receptor 
      stimulation by epinephrine can enhance ERK1/2 activity only in SS RBCs via PKA-
      and tyrosine kinase p72syk-dependent pathways. ERK signaling is implicated in RBC
      ICAM-4 phosphorylation, promoting SS RBC adhesion to the endothelium. SS RBC
      adhesion and phosphorylation of both ERK and ICAM-4 all decreased with continued 
      cell exposure to epinephrine, implying that activation of ICAM-4–mediated SS RBC 
      adhesion is temporally associated with ERK1/2 activation. Furthermore,
      recombinant ERK2 phosphorylated α- and β-adducins and dematin at the ERK
      consensus motif. Cytoskeletal protein 4.1 also showed dynamic phosphorylation but
      not at the ERK consensus motif. These results demonstrate that ERK activation
      induces phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins and the adhesion molecule
      ICAM-4, promoting SS RBC adhesion to the endothelium. Thus, blocking RBC ERK1/2
      activation, such as that promoted by catecholamine stress hormones, could
      ameliorate SCD pathophysiology.

TI  - The SRC-associated protein CUB Domain-Containing Protein-1 regulates adhesion and
      motility.
PG  - 653-63
AB  - Multiple SRC-family kinases (SFKs) are commonly activated in carcinoma and appear
      to have a role in metastasis through incompletely understood mechanisms. Recent
      studies have shown that CDCP1 (CUB (complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1)
      Domain-Containing Protein-1) is a transmembrane protein and an SRC substrate
      potentially involved in metastasis. Here we show that increased SFK and CDCP1
      tyrosine phosphorylation is, surprisingly, associated with a decrease in FAK
      phosphorylation. This appears to be true in human tumors as shown by our
      correlation analysis of a mass spectrometric data set of affinity-purified
      phosphotyrosine peptides obtained from normal and cancer lung tissue samples.
      Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of CDCP1 in cell culture, including by a
      mAb that binds to its extracellular domain, promoted changes in SFK and FAK
      tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as in PKC™, a protein known to associate with
      CDCP1, and these changes are accompanied by increases in adhesion and motility.
      Thus, signaling events that accompany the CDCP1 tyrosine phosphorylation observed
      in cell lines and human lung tumors may explain how the CDCP1/SFK complex
      regulates motility and adhesion.

TI  - The multifunctional poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) 1 is subject to extensive
      dynamic post-translational modification, which molecular modelling suggests plays
      an important role in co-ordinating its activities.
PG  - 803-12
AB  - PABP1 [poly(A)-binding protein 1] is a central regulator of mRNA translation and 
      stability and is required for miRNA (microRNA)-mediated regulation and
      nonsense-mediated decay. Numerous protein, as well as RNA, interactions underlie 
      its multi-functional nature; however, it is unclear how its different activities 
      are co-ordinated, since many partners interact via overlapping binding sites. In 
      the present study, we show that human PABP1 is subject to elaborate
      post-translational modification, identifying 14 modifications located throughout 
      the functional domains, all but one of which are conserved in mouse.
      Intriguingly, PABP1 contains glutamate and aspartate methylations, modifications 
      of unknown function in eukaryotes, as well as lysine and arginine methylations,
      and lysine acetylations. The latter dramatically alter the pI of PABP1, an effect
      also observed during the cell cycle, suggesting that different biological
      processes/stimuli can regulate its modification status, although PABP1 also
      probably exists in differentially modified subpopulations within cells. Two
      lysine residues were differentially acetylated or methylated, revealing that
      PABP1 may be the first example of a cytoplasmic protein utilizing a
      ‘methylation/acetylation switch’. Modelling using available structures implicates
      these modifications in regulating interactions with individual PAM2
      (PABP-interacting motif 2)-containing proteins, suggesting a direct link between 
      PABP1 modification status and the formation of distinct mRNP (messenger
      ribonucleoprotein) complexes that regulate mRNA fate in the cytoplasm.

TI  - An adult passive transfer mouse model to study desmoglein 3 signaling in
      pemphigus vulgaris.
PG  - 346-55
AB  - Evidence has accumulated that changes in intracellular signaling downstream of
      desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) may play a significant role in epithelial blistering in the
      autoimmune disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV). Currently, most studies on PV involve
      passive transfer of pathogenic antibodies into neonatal mice which have not
      finalized epidermal morphogenesis, and do not permit analysis of mature hair
      follicles (HFs) and stem cell niches. To investigate Dsg3 antibody-induced
      signaling in the adult epidermis at defined stages of the HF cycle, we here
      developed a model with passive transfer of the monospecific pathogenic Dsg3
      antibody AK23 into adult 8-week-old C57Bl/6J mice. Validated using
      histopathological and molecular methods, we found that this model faithfully
      recapitulates major features described in PV patients and PV models. Two hours
      after AK23 transfer we observed widening of intercellular spaces between
      desmosomes and EGFR activation, followed by increased Myc expression and
      epidermal hyperproliferation, desmosomal Dsg3 depletion and predominant
      blistering in HFs and oral mucosa. These data confirm that the adult passive
      transfer mouse model is ideally suited for detailed studies of Dsg3
      antibody-mediated signaling in adult skin, providing the basis for investigations
      on novel keratinocyte-specific therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Protein Expression Signatures for Inhibition of Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor-mediated Signaling*.
LID - M111.015222
AB  - Analysis of cellular signaling networks typically involves targeted measurements 
      of phosphorylated protein intermediates. However, phosphoproteomic analyses
      usually require affinity enrichment of phosphopeptides and can be complicated by 
      artifactual changes in phosphorylation caused by uncontrolled preanalytical
      variables, particularly in the analysis of tissue specimens. We asked whether
      changes in protein expression, which are more stable and easily analyzed, could
      reflect network stimulation and inhibition. We employed this approach to analyze 
      stimulation and inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by EGF 
      and selective EGFR inhibitors. Shotgun analysis of proteomes from proliferating
      A431 cells, EGF-stimulated cells, and cells co-treated with the EGFR inhibitors
      cetuximab or gefitinib identified groups of differentially expressed proteins.
      Comparisons of these protein groups identified 13 proteins whose EGF-induced
      expression changes were reversed by both EGFR inhibitors. Targeted multiple
      reaction monitoring analysis verified differential expression of 12 of these
      proteins, which comprise a candidate EGFR inhibition signature. We then tested
      these 12 proteins by multiple reaction monitoring analysis in three other models:
      1) a comparison of DiFi (EGFR inhibitor-sensitive) and HCT116 (EGFR-insensitive) 
      cell lines, 2) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse xenograft DiFi and
      HCT116 tumors, and 3) in tissue biopsies from a patient with the gastric
      hyperproliferative disorder Ménétrier's disease who was treated with cetuximab.
      Of the proteins in the candidate signature, a core group, including c-Jun,
      Jagged-1, and Claudin 4, were decreased by EGFR inhibitors in all three models.
      Although the goal of these studies was not to validate a clinically useful EGFR
      inhibition signature, the results confirm the hypothesis that clinically used
      EGFR inhibitors generate characteristic protein expression changes. This work
      further outlines a prototypical approach to derive and test protein expression
      signatures for drug action on signaling networks.

TI  - Dynamics of the G Protein-coupled Vasopressin V2 Receptor Signaling Network
      Revealed by Quantitative Phosphoproteomics*.
LID - M111.014613
AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate diverse physiological processes, and
      many human diseases are due to defects in GPCR signaling. To identify the dynamic
      response of a signaling network downstream from a prototypical Gs-coupled GPCR,
      the vasopressin V2 receptor, we have carried out multireplicate, quantitative
      phosphoproteomics with iTRAQ labeling at four time points following vasopressin
      exposure at a physiological concentration in cells isolated from rat kidney. A
      total of 12,167 phosphopeptides were identified from 2,783 proteins, with 273
      changing significantly in abundance with vasopressin. Two-dimensional clustering 
      of phosphopeptide time courses and Gene Ontology terms revealed that ligand
      binding to the V2 receptor affects more than simply the canonical cyclic
      adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A and arrestin pathways under
      physiological conditions. The regulated proteins included key components of actin
      cytoskeleton remodeling, cell-cell adhesion, mitogen-activated protein kinase
      signaling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and apoptosis pathways. These data suggest
      that vasopressin can regulate an array of cellular functions well beyond its
      classical role in regulating water and solute transport. These results greatly
      expand the current view of GPCR signaling in a physiological context and shed new
      light on potential roles for this signaling network in disorders such as
      polycystic kidney disease. Finally, we provide an online resource of
      physiologically regulated phosphorylation sites with dynamic quantitative data
      (http://helixweb.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/TiPD/index.html).

TI  - Positive Selection for New Disease Mutations in the Human Germline: Evidence from
      the Heritable Cancer Syndrome Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2B.
LID - e1002420
AB  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) is a highly aggressive thyroid
      cancer syndrome. Since almost all sporadic cases are caused by the same
      nucleotide substitution in the RET proto-oncogene, the calculated disease
      incidence is 100–200 times greater than would be expected based on the genome
      average mutation frequency. In order to determine whether this increased
      incidence is due to an elevated mutation rate at this position (true mutation hot
      spot) or a selective advantage conferred on mutated spermatogonial stem cells, we
      studied the spatial distribution of the mutation in 14 human testes. In donors
      aged 36–68, mutations were clustered with small regions of each testis having
      mutation frequencies several orders of magnitude greater than the rest of the
      testis. In donors aged 19–23 mutations were almost non-existent, demonstrating
      that clusters in middle-aged donors grew during adulthood. Computational analysis
      showed that germline selection is the only plausible explanation. Testes of men
      aged 75–80 were heterogeneous with some like middle-aged and others like younger 
      testes. Incorporating data on age-dependent death of spermatogonial stem cells
      explains the results from all age groups. Germline selection also explains
      MEN2B's male mutation bias and paternal age effect. Our discovery focuses
      attention on MEN2B as a model for understanding the genetic and biochemical basis
      of germline selection. Since RET function in mouse spermatogonial stem cells has 
      been extensively studied, we are able to suggest that the MEN2B mutation provides
      a selective advantage by altering the PI3K/AKT and SFK signaling pathways.
      Mutations that are preferred in the germline but reduce the fitness of offspring 
      increase the population's mutational load. Our approach is useful for studying
      other disease mutations with similar characteristics and could uncover additional
      germline selection pathways or identify true mutation hot spots.

TI  - Oncogene-specific activation of tyrosine kinase networks during prostate cancer
      progression.
PG  - 1643-8
AB  - Dominant mutations or DNA amplification of tyrosine kinases are rare among the
      oncogenic alterations implicated in prostate cancer. We demonstrate that
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in men exhibits increased tyrosine
      phosphorylation, raising the question of whether enhanced tyrosine kinase
      activity is observed in prostate cancer in the absence of specific tyrosine
      kinase mutation or DNA amplification. We generated a mouse model of prostate
      cancer progression using commonly perturbed non-tyrosine kinase oncogenes and
      pathways and detected a significant up-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation at 
      the carcinoma stage. Phosphotyrosine peptide enrichment and quantitative mass
      spectrometry identified oncogene-specific tyrosine kinase signatures, including
      activation of EGFR, ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EPHA2), and JAK2. Kinase:substrate 
      relationship analysis of the phosphopeptides also revealed ABL1 and SRC tyrosine 
      kinase activation. The observation of elevated tyrosine kinase signaling in
      advanced prostate cancer and identification of specific tyrosine kinase pathways 
      from genetically defined tumor models point to unique therapeutic approaches
      using tyrosine kinase inhibitors for advanced prostate cancer.

TI  - Proteomics in the characterization of adipose dysfunction in obesity.
PG  - 25-37
AB  - Adipose tissue plays a central role in body weight homeostasis, inflammation, and
      insulin resistance via serving as a fat-buffering system, regulating lipid
      storage and mobilization and releasing a large range of adipokines and cytokines.
      Adipose tissue is also the major inflammation-initiated site in obesity.
      Adipose-derived adipokines and cytokines are known to be involved in the
      modulation of a wide range of important physiological processes, particularly
      immune response, glucose and lipid homeostasis and insulin resistance. Adipose
      tissue dysfunction, characterized by an imbalanced secretion of pro- and
      anti-inflammatory adipokines and cytokines, decreased insulin-stimulated glucose 
      uptake, dysregulation of lipid storage and release and mitochondrial dysfunction,
      has been linked to obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. Proteomic
      technology has been a powerful tool for identifying key components of the adipose
      proteome, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of adipose tissue dysfunction 
      in obesity. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in the proteomic
      characterization of adipose tissue and discussed the identified proteins that
      potentially play important roles in insulin resistance and lipid homeostasis.

      the regulation of cell destiny: respiration, apoptosis, and human disease.
PG  - 237-64
AB  - The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system generates the vast
      majority of cellular energy, but is also involved in the generation of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis. Cytochrome c (Cytc) and cytochrome c oxidase
      (COX) represent the terminal step of the electron transport chain (ETC), the
      proposed rate-limiting reaction in mammals. Cytc and COX show unique regulatory
      features including allosteric regulation, isoform expression, and regulation
      through cell signaling pathways. This chapter focuses on the latter and discusses
      all mapped phosphorylation sites based on the crystal structures of COX and Cytc.
      Several signaling pathways have been identified that target COX including protein
      kinase A and C, receptor tyrosine kinase, and inflammatory signaling. In
      addition, four phosphorylation sites have been mapped on Cytc with potentially
      large implications due to its multiple functions including apoptosis, a pathway
      that is overactive in stressed cells but inactive in cancer. The role of COX and 
      Cytc phosphorylation is reviewed in a human disease context, including cancer,
      inflammation, sepsis, asthma, and ischemia/reperfusion injury as seen in
      myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.

TI  - Will Kinase Inhibitors Make it as Glioblastoma Drugs?
PG  - 135-69
AB  - Kinase inhibitors have emerged as effective cancer therapeutics in a variety of
      human cancers. Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor in
      adults, represents a compelling disease for kinase inhibitor therapy because the 
      majority of these tumors harbor genetic alterations that result in aberrant
      activation of growth factor signaling pathways. Attempts to target the
      Ras—Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)—mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)
      axis in GBM with first generation receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors and
      rapalogs have been disappointing. However, there is reason for renewed optimism
      given the now very detailed knowledge of the cancer genome in GBM and a wealth of
      novel compounds entering the clinic, including next generation RTK inhibitors,
      class I PI3K inhibitors, mTOR kinase inhibitors (TORKinibs), and dual PI3(K)/mTOR
      inhibitors. This chapter reviews common genetic alterations in growth factor
      signaling pathways in GBM, their validation as therapeutic targets in this
      disease, and strategies for future clinical development of kinase inhibitors for 
      high grade glioma.

TI  - MicroRNAs: molecular features and role in cancer.
PG  - 2508-40
AB  - microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding endogenously produced RNAs that play key
      roles in controlling the expression of many cellular proteins. Once they are
      recruited and incorporated into a ribonucleoprotein complex miRISC, they can
      target specific mRNAs in a miRNA sequence-dependent process and interfere in the 
      translation into proteins of the targeted mRNAs via several mechanisms.
      Consequently, miRNAs can regulate many cellular pathways and processes.
      Dysregulation of their physiological roles may largely contribute to disease. In 
      particular, in cancer, miRNAs can be involved in the deregulation of the
      expression of important genes that play key roles in tumorigenesis, tumor
      development, and angiogenesis and have oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles. This 
      review focuses on the biogenesis and maturation of miRNAs, their mechanisms of
      gene regulation, and the way their expression is deregulated in cancer. The
      involvement of miRNAs in several oncogenic pathways such as angiogenesis and
      apoptosis, and in the inter-cellular dialog mediated by miRNA-loaded exosomes as 
      well as the development of new therapeutical strategies based on miRNAs will be
      discussed.

TI  - Exosome mimetics: a novel class of drug delivery systems.
PG  - 1525-41
AB  - The identification of extracellular phospholipid vesicles as conveyors of
      cellular information has created excitement in the field of drug delivery.
      Biological therapeutics, including short interfering RNA and recombinant
      proteins, are prone to degradation, have limited ability to cross biological
      membranes, and may elicit immune responses. Therefore, delivery systems for such 
      drugs are under intensive investigation. Exploiting extracellular vesicles as
      carriers for biological therapeutics is a promising strategy to overcome these
      issues and to achieve efficient delivery to the cytosol of target cells. Exosomes
      are a well studied class of extracellular vesicles known to carry proteins and
      nucleic acids, making them especially suitable for such strategies. However, the 
      considerable complexity and the related high chance of off-target effects of
      these carriers are major barriers for translation to the clinic. Given that it is
      well possible that not all components of exosomes are required for their proper
      functioning, an alternative strategy would be to mimic these vesicles
      synthetically. By assembly of liposomes harboring only crucial components of
      natural exosomes, functional exosome mimetics may be created. The low complexity 
      and use of well characterized components strongly increase the pharmaceutical
      acceptability of such systems. However, exosomal components that would be
      required for the assembly of functional exosome mimetics remain to be identified.
      This review provides insights into the composition and functional properties of
      exosomes, and focuses on components which could be used to enhance the drug
      delivery properties of exosome mimetics.

TI  - Characterization of the Phosphoproteome in Human Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid.
LID - 460261
AB  - Global-scale examination of protein phosphorylation in human biological fluids by
      phosphoproteomics approaches is an emerging area of research with potential for
      significant contributions towards discovery of novel biomarkers. In this pilot
      work, we analyzed the phosphoproteome in human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL)
      from nondiseased subjects. The main objectives were to assess the feasibility to 
      probe phosphorylated proteins in human BAL and to obtain the initial catalog of
      BAL phosphoproteins, including protein identities and exact description of their 
      phosphorylation sites. We used a gel-free bioanalytical workflow that included
      whole-proteome digestion of depleted BAL proteins, enrichment of phosphopeptides 
      by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), LC-MS/MS analyses with a
      linear ion trap mass spectrometer, and searches of a protein sequence database to
      generate a panel of BAL phosphoproteins and their sites of phosphorylation. Based
      on sequence-diagnostic MS/MS fragmentation patterns, we identified a collection
      of 36 phosphopeptides that contained 26 different phosphorylation sites. These
      phosphopeptides mapped to 21 phosphoproteins including, for example, vimentin,
      plastin-2, ferritin heavy chain, kininogen-1, and others. The characterized
      phosphoproteins have diverse characteristics in terms of cellular origin and
      biological function. To the best of our knowledge, results of this study
      represent the first description of the human BAL phosphoproteome.

      associated proteins. Here we present the first in vivo proteome analysis of a
      member of the ESCRT-III complex which is unique to the plant kingdom. We show
      with LC–MS/MS, yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence
      complementation (BiFC) that coimmunoprecipitated proteins from
      Arabidopsisthaliana roots expressing a functional GFP-tagged VACUOLAR PROTEIN
      SORTING 2.2 (AtVPS2.2) protein are members of the ESCRT-III complex and
      associated proteins. Therefore we propose that at least in plants the large
      ESCRT-III membrane scaffolding complex consists of a mixture of SNF7, VPS2 and
      the associated VPS46 and VPS60 proteins. Apart from transmembrane proteins,
      numerous membrane-associated but also nuclear and extracellular proteins have
      been identified, indicating that AtVPS2.2 might be involved in processes beyond
      the classical ESCRT role. This study is the first in vivo proteome analysis with 
      a tagged ESCRT-III component demonstrating the feasibility of this approach and
      provides numerous starting points for the investigation of the biological process
      in which AtVPS2.2 is involved.

TI  - Nuclear Transport: A Switch for the Oxidative Stress—Signaling Circuit?
LID - 208650
AB  - Imbalances in the formation and clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can
      lead to oxidative stress and subsequent changes that affect all aspects of
      physiology. To limit and repair the damage generated by ROS, cells have developed
      a multitude of responses. A hallmark of these responses is the activation of
      signaling pathways that modulate the function of downstream targets in different 
      cellular locations. To this end, critical steps of the stress response that occur
      in the nucleus and cytoplasm have to be coordinated, which makes the proper
      communication between both compartments mandatory. Here, we discuss the
      interdependence of ROS-mediated signaling and the transport of macromolecules
      across the nuclear envelope. We highlight examples of oxidant-dependent nuclear
      trafficking and describe the impact of oxidative stress on the transport
      apparatus. Our paper concludes by proposing a cellular circuit of ROS-induced
      signaling, nuclear transport and repair.

TI  - Cell Stress Proteins in Atherothrombosis.
LID - 232464
AB  - Cell stress proteins (CSPs) are a large and heterogenous family of proteins,
      sharing two main characteristics: their levels and/or location are modified under
      stress and most of them can exert a chaperon function inside the cells.
      Nonetheless, they are also involved in the modulation of several mechanisms, both
      at the intracellular and the extracellular compartments. There are more than 100 
      proteins belonging to the CSPs family, among them the thioredoxin (TRX) system,
      which is the focus of the present paper. TRX system is composed of several
      proteins such as TRX and peroxiredoxin (PRDX), two thiol-containing enzymes that 
      are key players in redox homeostasis due to their ability to scavenge potential
      harmful reactive oxygen species. In addition to their main role as antioxidants, 
      recent data highlights their function in several processes such as cell
      signalling, immune inflammatory responses, or apoptosis, all of them key
      mechanisms involved in atherothrombosis. Moreover, since TRX and PRDX are present
      in the pathological vascular wall and can be secreted under prooxidative
      conditions to the circulation, several studies have addressed their role as
      diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases
      (CVDs).

TI  - Protein-intrinsic and signaling network-based sources of resistance to EGFR- and 
      ErbB family-targeted therapies in head and neck cancer.
PG  - 260-79
AB  - Agents targeting EGFR and related ErbB family proteins are valuable therapies for
      the treatment of many cancers. For some tumor types, including squamous cell
      carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN), antibodies targeting EGFR were the first
      protein-directed agents to show clinical benefit, and remain a standard component
      of clinical strategies for management of the disease. Nevertheless, many patients
      display either intrinsic or acquired resistance to these drugs; hence, major
      research goals are to better understand the underlying causes of resistance, and 
      to develop new therapeutic strategies that boost the impact of EGFR/ErbB
      inhibitors. In this review, we first summarize current standard use of EGFR
      inhibitors in the context of SCCHN, and described new agents targeting EGFR
      currently moving through pre-clinical and clinical development. We then discuss
      how changes in other transmembrane receptors, including IGF1R, c-Met, and TGF-β, 
      can confer resistance to EGFR-targeted inhibitors, and discuss new agents
      targeting these proteins. Moving downstream, we discuss critical EGFR-dependent
      effectors, including PLC-γ; PI3K and PTEN; SHC, GRB2, and RAS and the STAT
      proteins, as factors in resistance to EGFR-directed inhibitors and as alternative
      targets of therapeutic inhibition. We summarize alternative sources of resistance
      among cellular changes that target EGFR itself, through regulation of ligand
      availability, post-translational modification of EGFR, availability of EGFR
      partners for hetero-dimerization and control of EGFR intracellular trafficking
      for recycling versus degradation. Finally, we discuss new strategies to identify 
      effective therapeutic combinations involving EGFR-targeted inhibitors, in the
      context of new system level data becoming available for analysis of individual
      tumors.

AB  - TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) is a highly conserved protein kinase that is important 
      in both fundamental and clinical biology. In fundamental biology, TOR is a
      nutrient-sensitive, central controller of cell growth and aging. In clinical
      biology, TOR is implicated in many diseases and is the target of the drug
      rapamycin used in three different therapeutic areas. The yeast Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae has played a prominent role in both the discovery of TOR and the
      elucidation of its function. Here we review the TOR signaling network in S.
      cerevisiae.

TI  - Uncovering the Proteome Response of the Master Circadian Clock to Light Using an 
      AutoProteome System*.
LID - M110.007252
AB  - In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central circadian pacemaker 
      that governs rhythmic fluctuations in behavior and physiology in a 24-hr cycle
      and synchronizes them to the external environment by daily resetting in response 
      to light. The bilateral SCN is comprised of a mere ∼20,000 neurons serving as
      cellular oscillators, a fact that has, until now, hindered the systematic study
      of the SCN on a global proteome level. Here we developed a fully automated and
      integrated proteomics platform, termed AutoProteome system, for an in-depth
      analysis of the light-responsive proteome of the murine SCN. All requisite steps 
      for a large-scale proteomic study, including preconcentration, buffer exchanging,
      reduction, alkylation, digestion and online two-dimensional liquid
      chromatography-tandem MS analysis, are performed automatically on a standard
      liquid chromatography-MS system. As low as 2 ng of model protein bovine serum
      albumin and up to 20 μg and 200 μg of SCN proteins can be readily processed and
      analyzed by this system. From the SCN tissue of a single mouse, we were able to
      confidently identify 2131 proteins, of which 387 were light-regulated based on a 
      spectral counts quantification approach. Bioinformatics analysis of the
      light-inducible proteins reveals their diverse distribution in different
      canonical pathways and their heavy connection in 19 protein interaction networks.
      The AutoProteome system identified vasopressin-neurophysin 2-copeptin and casein 
      kinase 1 delta, both of which had been previously implicated in clock timing
      processes, as light-inducible proteins in the SCN. Ras-specific guanine
      nucleotide-releasing factor 1, ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, and X-linked
      ubiquitin specific protease 9, none of which had previously been implicated in
      SCN clock timing processes, were also identified in this study as light-inducible
      proteins. The AutoProteome system opens a new avenue to systematically explore
      the proteome-wide events that occur in the SCN, either in response to light or
      other stimuli, or as a consequence of its intrinsic pacemaker capacity.

PG  - 3435-40
AB  - Phosphorylation of proteins is an important mechanism used to regulate most
      cellular processes. Recently, we completed an extensive phosphoproteomic analysis
      of the core proteins that constitute the Saccharomyces cerevisiae centrosome.
      Here, we present a study of phosphorylation sites found on the mitotic exit
      network (MEN) proteins, most of which are associated with the cytoplasmic face of
      the centrosome. We identified 55 sites on Bfa1, Cdc5, Cdc14 and Cdc15. Eight
      sites lie in cyclin-dependent kinase motifs (Cdk, S/T-P), and 22 sites are
      completely conserved within fungi. More than half of the sites were found in
      centrosomes from mitotic cells, possibly in preparation for their roles in
      mitotic exit. Finally, we report phosphorylation site information for other
      important cell cycle and regulatory proteins.

TI  - Mammalian Pragmin regulates Src family kinases via the Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala
      (EPIYA) motif that is exploited by bacterial effectors.
PG  - 14938-43
AB  - Several pathogenic bacteria have adopted effector proteins that, upon delivery
      into mammalian cells, undergo tyrosine phosphorylation at the Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala
      (EPIYA) or EPIYA-like sequence motif by host kinases such as Src family kinases
      (SFKs). This EPIYA phosphorylation triggers complex formation of bacterial
      effectors with SH2 domain-containing proteins that results in perturbation of
      host cell signaling and subsequent pathogenesis. Although the presence of such an
      anomalous protein interaction suggests the existence of a mammalian
      EPIYA-containing protein whose function is mimicked or subverted by bacterial
      EPIYA effectors, no molecule that uses the EPIYA motif for biological function
      has so far been reported in mammals. Here we show that mammalian Pragmin/SgK223
      undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the EPIYA motif by SFKs and thereby
      acquires the ability to interact with the SH2 domain of the C-terminal Src kinase
      (Csk), a negative regulator of SFKs. The Pragmin–Csk interaction prevents
      translocalization of Csk from the cytoplasm to the membrane and subsequent
      inactivation of membrane-associated SFKs. As a result, SFK activity is sustained 
      in cells where Pragmin is phosphorylated at the EPIYA motif. Because EPIYA
      phosphorylation of Pragmin is mediated by SFKs, cytoplasmic sequestration of Csk 
      by Pragmin establishes a positive feedback regulation of SFK activation.
      Remarkably, the Helicobacter pylori EPIYA effector CagA binds to the Csk SH2
      domain in place of Pragmin and enforces membrane recruitment of Csk and
      subsequent inhibition of SFKs. This work identifies Pragmin as a mammalian EPIYA 
      effector and suggests that bacterial EPIYA effectors target Pragmin to subvert
      SFKs for successful infection.

TI  - Angiotensin II type 1 receptor signalling regulates microRNA differentially in
      cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes.
PG  - 394-404
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) is a key
      regulator of blood pressure and cardiac contractility and is profoundly involved 
      in development of cardiac disease. Since several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been
      implicated in cardiac disease, we determined whether miRNAs might be regulated by
      AT1R signals in a Gαq/11-dependent or -independent manner. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH:
      We performed a global miRNA array analysis of angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated
      miRNA regulation in HEK293N cells overexpressing the AT1R and focused on
      separating the role of Gαq/11-dependent and -independent pathways. MiRNA
      regulation was verified with quantitative PCR in both HEK293N cells and primary
      cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. KEY RESULTS: Our studies revealed five miRNAs
      (miR-29b, -129-3p, -132, -132* and -212) that were up-regulated by Ang II in
      HEK293N cells. In contrast, the biased Ang II analogue, [Sar1, Ile4, Ile8] Ang II
      (SII Ang II), which selectively activates Gαq/11-independent signalling, failed
      to regulate miRNAs in HEK293N cells. Furthermore, Ang II-induced miRNA regulation
      was blocked following Gαq/11 and Mek1 inhibition. The observed Ang II regulation 
      of miRNA was confirmed in primary cultures of adult cardiac fibroblasts.
      Interestingly, Ang II did not regulate miRNA expression in cardiac myocytes, but 
      SII Ang II significantly down-regulated miR-129-3p. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS:
      Five miRNAs were regulated by Ang II through mechanisms depending on Gαq/11 and
      Erk1/2 activation. These miRNAs may be involved in Ang II-mediated cardiac
      biology and disease, as several of these miRNAs have previously been associated
      with cardiovascular disease and were found to be regulated in cardiac cells.

TI  - Global proteomics analysis of testis and ovary in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio).
PG  - 619-47
AB  - The molecular mechanisms controlling sex determination and differentiation in
      zebrafish (Danio rerio) are largely unknown. A genome-wide analysis may provide
      comprehensive insights into the processes involved. The mRNA expression in
      zebrafish gonads has been fairly well studied, but much less data on the
      corresponding protein expression are available, although the proteins are
      considered to be more relevant markers of gene function. Because mRNA and protein
      abundances rarely correlate well, mRNA profiles need to be complemented with the 
      information on protein expression. The work presented here analyzed the proteomes
      of adult zebrafish gonads by a multidimensional protein identification
      technology, generating the to-date most populated lists of proteins expressed in 
      mature zebrafish gonads. The acquired proteomics data partially confirmed
      existing transcriptomics information for several genes, including several novel
      transcripts. However, disagreements between mRNA and protein abundances were
      often observed, further stressing the necessity to assess the expression on
      different levels before drawing conclusions on a certain gene’s expression and
      function. Several gene groups expressed in a sexually dimorphic way in zebrafish 
      gonads were identified. Their potential importance for gonad development and
      function is discussed. The data gained in the current study provide a basis for
      further work on elucidating processes occurring during zebrafish development with
      use of high-throughput proteomics.Electronic supplementary material: The online

TI  - Forced Dimerization Increases the Activity of ΔEGFR/EGFRvIII and Enhances Its
      Oncogenicity.
PG  - 1199-208
AB  - ΔEGFR, an in-frame deletion mutant of the extracellular ligand-binding domain,
      which occurs in about 30% of glioblastoma, is a potent oncogene that promotes
      tumor growth and progression. The signaling of ΔEGFR is ligand-independent and
      low intensity, allowing it to evade the normal mechanisms of internalization and 
      degradation by the endocytic machinery, and hence is persistent. The basis of the
      oncogenic potential of ΔEGFR remains incompletely understood, including whether
      dimerization plays an important role in its signal and whether its oncogenic
      potential is dependent on its relatively low intensity, when compared to the
      acutely activated wild-type receptor. To examine these two important questions we
      have generated a chimeric ΔEGFR that allows forced dimerization via domains
      derived from variants of the FKBP12 protein that are brought together by
      FK506-derivatives. Forced dimerization of chimeric ΔEGFR significantly increased 
      the intensity of its signal, as measured by receptor phosphorylation levels,
      suggesting that the naturally occurring ΔEGFR does not form strong or stable
      dimers as part of its low level signal. Interestingly the increased activity of
      dimerized, chimeric ΔEGFR did not promote receptor internalization, implying that
      ΔEGFR’s reduced rate of endocytic downregulation is an inherent characteristic.
      Significantly, forced dimerization enhanced the oncogenic signal of the receptor,
      implying that the ΔEGFR is a potent oncogene despite, not because of its low
      intensity.

TI  - Unraveling regulation and new components of human P-bodies through a protein
      interaction framework and experimental validation.
PG  - 1619-34
AB  - The cellular factors involved in mRNA degradation and translation repression can 
      aggregate into cytoplasmic domains known as GW bodies or mRNA processing bodies
      (P-bodies). However, current understanding of P-bodies, especially the regulatory
      aspect, remains relatively fragmentary. To provide a framework for studying the
      mechanisms and regulation of P-body formation, maintenance, and disassembly, we
      compiled a list of P-body proteins found in various species and further grouped
      both reported and predicted human P-body proteins according to their functions.
      By analyzing protein–protein interactions of human P-body components, we found
      that many P-body proteins form complex interaction networks with each other and
      with other cellular proteins that are not recognized as P-body components. The
      observation suggests that these other cellular proteins may play important roles 
      in regulating P-body dynamics and functions. We further used siRNA-mediated gene 
      knockdown and immunofluorescence microscopy to demonstrate the validity of our in
      silico analyses. Our combined approach identifies new P-body components and
      suggests that protein ubiquitination and protein phosphorylation involving 14-3-3
      proteins may play critical roles for post-translational modifications of P-body
      components in regulating P-body dynamics. Our analyses provide not only a global 
      view of human P-body components and their physical interactions but also a wealth
      of hypotheses to help guide future research on the regulation and function of
      human P-bodies.

      of colon cancer cells.
PG  - 552-61
AB  - Background:: The KIAA1199 transcript is upregulated in colon adenomas and
      downregulated upon β-catenin knockdown. Methods:: Transcript profiling was
      performed on >500 colon biopsies, methylation profiling data were compared with
      transcript data. Immunohistochemistry assessed KIAA1199 protein expression in 270
      stage II/III tumours (>3 years follow-up). The effects of stable KIAA1199
      knockdown in SW480 cells (three different constructs) were studied using
      transcriptional profiling, proliferation and protein analysis. Results:: The
      KIAA1199 transcript was strongly upregulated in 95% of adenocarcinomas. Absent
      expression in normal mucosa correlated with KIAA1199 promotor methylation.
      Nuclear and cytoplasmic KIAA1199 protein expression was identified in colon
      adenocarcinomas and other types of cancers. A subpopulation of patients with
      tumours strongly expressing KIAA1199 in the nucleus showed a better outcome with 
      regard to recurrence as lung or liver metastases. The KIAA1199 knockdown affected
      the cell cycle and the Wnt-signalling pathway. Reduced cellular proliferation and
      decreased KI67, phosphorylated retinoblastoma, β-catenin and ASCL2 protein
      expression supported these findings. Eighteen Wnt-signalling genes differentially
      expressed upon KIAA1199 knockdown correlated with the KIAA1199 expression profile
      in clinical specimens. Conclusion:: The KIAA1199 knockdown attenuates the effects
      of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling and it may thus be regarded as a regulatory part 
      of this pathway.

TI  - 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) marks
      MYC-overexpressing human basal-like breast cancers.
PG  - 5164-74
AB  - In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells avidly take up glucose and metabolize
      it to lactate even when oxygen is abundant, a phenomenon referred to as the
      Warburg effect. This fundamental alteration in glucose metabolism in cancer cells
      enables their specific detection by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) following 
      intravenous injection of the glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose (18FDG).
      However, this useful imaging technique is limited by the fact that not all
      cancers avidly take up FDG. To identify molecular determinants of
      18FDG-retention, we interogated the transcriptomes of human cancer cell lines and
      primary tumors for metabolic pathways associated with 18FDG radiotracer uptake.
      From 95 metabolic pathways that were interrogated, the glycolysis and several
      glycolysis-related pathways (pentose-phosphate, carbon fixation, aminoacyl-tRNA
      biosynthesis, one-carbon-pool by folate) showed the greatest transcriptional
      enrichment. This “FDG signature” predicted FDG-uptake in breast cancer cell lines
      and overlapped with established gene expression signatures for the “basal-like”
      breast cancer subtype and MYC-induced tumorigenesis in mice. Human breast cancers
      with nuclear MYC staining and high RNA expression of MYC target genes showed high
      18FDG-PET uptake (p < 0.005). Presence of the FDG signature was similarly
      associated with MYC gene copy gain, increased MYC transcript levels, and elevated
      expression of metabolic MYC target genes in a human breast cancer genomic
      dataset. Together, our findings link clinical observations of glucose uptake with
      a pathologic and molecular subtype of human breast cancer. Further, they suggest 
      related approaches to derive molecular determinants of radiotracer retention for 
      other PET-imaging probes.

TI  - Cytosolic p120-catenin regulates growth of metastatic lobular carcinoma through
      Rock1-mediated anoikis resistance.
PG  - 3176-88
AB  - Metastatic breast cancer is the major cause of cancer-related death among women
      in the Western world. Invasive carcinoma cells are able to counteract apoptotic
      signals in the absence of anchorage, enabling cell survival during invasion and
      dissemination. Although loss of E-cadherin is a cardinal event in the development
      and progression of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), little is known about the
      underlying mechanisms that govern these processes. Using a mouse model of human
      ILC, we show here that cytosolic p120-catenin (p120) regulates tumor growth upon 
      loss of E-cadherin through the induction of anoikis resistance. p120 conferred
      anchorage independence by indirect activation of Rho/Rock signaling through
      interaction and inhibition of myosin phosphatase Rho–interacting protein (Mrip), 
      an antagonist of Rho/Rock function. Consistent with these data, primary human ILC
      samples expressed hallmarks of active Rock signaling, and Rock controlled the
      anoikis resistance of human ILC cells. Thus, we have linked loss of E-cadherin — 
      an initiating event in ILC development — to Rho/Rock-mediated control of
      anchorage-independent survival. Because activation of Rho and Rock are strongly
      linked to cancer progression and are susceptible to pharmacological inhibition,
      these insights may have clinical implications for the development of tailor-made 
      intervention strategies to better treat invasive and metastatic lobular breast
      cancer.

TI  - Genome-wide Characterization of miR-34a Induced Changes in Protein and mRNA
      Expression by a Combined Pulsed SILAC and Microarray Analysis*.
LID - M111.010462
AB  - The gene encoding the miR-34a microRNA is a transcriptional target of the p53
      tumor suppressor protein and subject to epigenetic inactivation in colorectal
      cancer and numerous other tumor types. Here, we combined pulsed SILAC (pSILAC)
      and microarray analyses to identify miR-34a-induced changes in protein and mRNA
      expression. pSILAC allowed to quantify the de novo protein synthesis of 1206
      proteins after activation of a conditional miR-34a allele in a colorectal cancer 
      cell line. ∼19% of the detected proteins were differentially regulated, with 113 
      proteins being down- and 115 up-regulated. The proteins with a miR-34a
      seed-matching-sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the corresponding
      mRNA showed a clear bias toward translational repression. Proteins involved in
      DNA replication, e.g. the MCM proteins, and cell proliferation, were
      over-represented among indirectly down-regulated proteins lacking a miR-34a
      seed-match. The decrease in de novo protein synthesis of direct miR-34a targets
      correlated with reduced levels of the corresponding mRNA in most cases,
      indicating an interdependence of both types of regulation. In addition, 43 mRNAs 
      encoding proteins not detected by pSILAC were down-regulated after miR-34a
      expression and contained miR-34a seed-matches. The direct regulation of selected 
      miR-34a target-mRNAs was confirmed using reporter assays. Via down-regulation of 
      the proteins encoded by these mRNAs miR-34a presumably inhibits glycolysis
      (LDHA), WNT-signaling (LEF1), invasion/migration (AXL) and lipid metabolism
      (ACSL1, ACSL4). Furthermore, miR-34a may activate p53 by inhibiting its
      acetylation (MTA2, HDAC1) and degradation (YY1). In summary, miR-34a presumably
      participates in multiple tumor suppressive pathways by directly and indirectly
      suppressing the expression of numerous, critical proteins.

      cardiac function.
PG  - 217-30
AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal through a variety of mechanisms that
      impact cardiac function, including contractility and hypertrophy. G
      protein-dependent and -independent pathways each have the capacity to initiate
      numerous intracellular signaling cascades to mediate these effects. G
      protein-dependent signaling has been studied for decades and great strides
      continue to be made in defining the intricate pathways and effectors regulated by
      G proteins and their impact on cardiac function. G protein-independent signaling 
      is a relatively newer concept that is being explored more frequently in the
      cardiovascular system. Recent studies have begun to reveal how cardiac function
      may be regulated via G protein-independent signaling, especially with respect to 
      the ever-expanding cohort of β-arrestin-mediated processes. This review primarily
      focuses on the impact of both G protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent
      signaling pathways on cardiac function, highlighting the most recent data that
      illustrate the comprehensive nature of these mechanisms of GPCR signaling.

      unique features that make it an ideal research tool for the study of the
      relationship between genotype and phenotype. Importantly fundamental genetic
      principles as well as key human disease genes have been uncovered through the use
      of Drosophila. The contribution of the fruit fly to science and medicine
      continues in the postgenomic era as cell-based Drosophila RNAi screens are a
      cost-effective and scalable enabling technology that can be used to quantify the 
      contribution of different genes to diverse cellular processes. Drosophila
      high-throughput screens can also be used as integral part of systems-level
      approaches to describe the architecture and dynamics of cellular networks.

      Differentially Regulate Phosphorylation of Protein Kinase A (PKA) and the Protein
      Kinase B (PKB)/S6K Ortholog Sch9*.
PG  - 22017-27
AB  - Pkh1, -2, and -3 are the yeast orthologs of mammalian
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). Although essential for
      viability, their functioning remains poorly understood. Sch9, the yeast protein
      kinase B and/or S6K ortholog, has been identified as one of their targets. We now
      have shown that in vitro interaction of Pkh1 and Sch9 depends on the hydrophobic 
      PDK1-interacting fragment pocket in Pkh1 and requires the complementary
      hydrophobic motif in Sch9. We demonstrated that Pkh1 phosphorylates Sch9 both in 
      vitro and in vivo on its PDK1 site and that this phosphorylation is essential for
      a wild type cell size. In vivo phosphorylation on this site disappeared during
      nitrogen deprivation and rapidly increased again upon nitrogen resupplementation.
      In addition, we have shown here for the first time that the PDK1 site in protein 
      kinase A is phosphorylated by Pkh1 in vitro, that this phosphorylation is
      Pkh-dependent in vivo and occurs during or shortly after synthesis of the protein
      kinase A catalytic subunits. Mutagenesis of the PDK1 site in Tpk1 abolished
      binding of the regulatory subunit and cAMP dependence. As opposed to PDK1 site
      phosphorylation of Sch9, phosphorylation of the PDK1 site in Tpk1 was not
      regulated by nitrogen availability. These results bring new insight into the
      control and prevalence of PDK1 site phosphorylation in yeast by Pkh protein
      kinases.

TI  - Identification of Kalirin-7 as a Potential Post-Synaptic Density Signaling Hub.
PG  - 2828-41
AB  - Kalirin-7 (Kal7), a multi-functional Rho GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1
      and RhoG, is embedded in the post-synaptic density at excitatory synapses, where 
      it participates in the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines. Kal7 has
      been implicated in long-term potentiation, fear memories and addiction-like
      behaviors. Using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectroscopy, we
      identified sites phosphorylated by six PSD-localized kinases implicated in
      synaptic plasticity and behavior, sites phosphorylated when myc-Kal7 was
      expressed in non-neuronal cells and sites phosphorylated in mouse brain Kal7. A
      site in the Sec14p domain phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin dependent protein 
      kinase II, protein kinase A and protein kinase C, was phosphorylated in mouse
      brain, but not in non-neuronal cells. Phosphorylation in the spectrin-like repeat
      region was more extensive in mouse brain than in non-neuronal cells, with a total
      of 20 sites identified. Sites in the pleckstrin homology domain and in the linker
      region connecting the GEF domain to the PDZ binding motif were heavily
      phosphorylated in both non-neuronal cells and in mouse brain and affected GEF
      activity. We postulate that the kinase convergence and divergence observed in
      Kal7 identify it as a key player in integration of the multiple inputs that
      regulate synaptic structure and function.

TI  - Functional Relevance of Biased Signaling at the Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor.
PG  - 99-111
AB  - Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (AT1R blockers, or ARBs) are used
      commonly in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders such as heart failure and
      hypertension. Their clinical success arises from their ability to prevent
      deleterious Gαq protein activation downstream of AT1R, which leads to a decrease 
      in morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have identified AT1R ligands that
      concurrently inhibit Gαq protein-dependent signaling and activate Gαq
      protein-independent/β-arrestin-dependent signaling downstream of AT1R, events
      that may actually improve cardiovascular performance more than conventional ARBs.
      The ability of such ligands to induce intracellular signaling events in an
      AT1R-β-arrestin-dependent manner while preventing AT1R-Gαq protein activity
      defines them as biased AT1R ligands. This mini-review will highlight recent
      studies that have defined biased signaling at the AT1R and discuss the possible
      clinical relevance of β-arrestin-biased AT1R ligands in the cardiovascular
      system.

TI  - A HIF-regulated VHL-PTP1B-Src signaling axis identifies a therapeutic target in
      Renal Cell Carcinoma.
PG  - 85ra47
AB  - Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a molecularly heterogeneous disease that
      is intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. While VEGF and mTOR 
      targeted therapies have shown clinical activity, their effects are variable and
      short-lived, underscoring the need for improved treatment strategies for RCC.
      Here, we used quantitative phosphoproteomics and immunohistochemical profiling of
      346 RCC specimens to determine that Src kinase signaling is elevated in RCC cells
      that retain wild type (WT) von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein expression.
      Correspondingly, VHL-WT RCC cell lines and xenografts were sensitized to the Src 
      inhibitor dasatinib compared to VHL null cells. Forced expression of hypoxia
      inducible factor (HIF) in VHL-WT RCC cells diminished Src signaling output by
      repressing transcription of the Src activator protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B
      (PTP1B) and conferred resistance to dasatinib. Our results suggest that a
      HIF-regulated VHL-PTP1B-Src signaling axis determines sensitivity of RCC to Src
      inhibitors and that stratification of RCC patients using antibody-based biomarker
      profiling may identify patients likely to respond to Src inhibitors in RCC
      clinical trials.

TI  - Spatial Phosphoprotein Profiling Reveals a Compartmentalized Extracellular
      Signal-regulated Kinase Switch Governing Neurite Growth and Retraction*.
PG  - 18190-201
AB  - Brain development and spinal cord regeneration require neurite sprouting and
      growth cone navigation in response to extension and collapsing factors present in
      the extracellular environment. These external guidance cues control neurite
      growth cone extension and retraction processes through intracellular protein
      phosphorylation of numerous cytoskeletal, adhesion, and polarity complex
      signaling proteins. However, the complex kinase/substrate signaling networks that
      mediate neuritogenesis have not been investigated. Here, we compare the neurite
      phosphoproteome under growth and retraction conditions using neurite purification
      methodology combined with mass spectrometry. More than 4000 non-redundant
      phosphorylation sites from 1883 proteins have been annotated and mapped to
      signaling pathways that control kinase/phosphatase networks, cytoskeleton
      remodeling, and axon/dendrite specification. Comprehensive informatics and
      functional studies revealed a compartmentalized ERK activation/deactivation
      cytoskeletal switch that governs neurite growth and retraction, respectively. Our
      findings provide the first system-wide analysis of the phosphoprotein signaling
      networks that enable neurite growth and retraction and reveal an important
      molecular switch that governs neuritogenesis.

TI  - P2X7 Receptor Antagonists Display Agonist-like Effects on Cell Signaling
      Proteins.
PG  - 532-42
AB  - Background: The activation of various P2 receptors (P2R) by extracellular
      nucleotides promotes diverse cellular events, including the stimulation of cell
      signaling protein and increases in [Ca2+]i. We report that some agents that can
      block P2X7R receptors also promote diverse P2X7R-independent effects on cell
      signaling. Methods: We exposed native rat parotid acinar cells, salivary gland
      cell lines (Par-C10, HSY, HSG), and PC12 cells to suramin, DIDS
      (4,4′-diisothiocyano stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid), Cibacron Blue 3GA, Brilliant
      Blue G, and the P2X7R-selective antagonist A438079, and examined the
      activation/phosphorylation of ERK1/2, PKCδ, Src, CDCP1, and other signaling
      proteins. Results: With the exception of suramin, these agents blocked the
      phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by BzATP in rat parotid acinar cells; but higher
      concentrations of suramin blocked ATP-stimulated 45Ca2+ entry. Aside from
      A438079, these agents increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Src, PKCδ, and
      other proteins (including Dok-1) within minutes in an agent- and cell
      type-specific manner in the absence of a P2X7R ligand. The stimulatory effect of 
      these compounds on the tyrosine phosphorylation of CDCP1 and its Src-dependent
      association with PKCδ was blocked by knockdown of CDCP1, which also blocked Src
      and PKCδ phosphorylation. Conclusions: Several agents used as P2X7R blockers
      promote the activation of various signaling proteins and thereby act more like
      receptor agonists than antagonists. General significance: Some compounds used to 
      block P2 receptors have complicated effects that may confound their use in
      blocking receptor activation and other biological processes for which they are
      employed, including their use as blockers of various ion transport proteins.

TI  - Epstein-Barr Virus LMP1 Activates EGFR, STAT3, and ERK through Effects on PKCδ▿.
PG  - 4399-408
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that infects more than 90%
      of the world's adult population and is linked to multiple malignancies, including
      Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The EBV
      oncoprotein LMP1 induces transcription of the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR), which is expressed at high levels in NPC. EGFR transcription is induced
      by LMP1 through a p50 NFκB1-Bcl-3 complex, and Bcl-3 is induced by LMP1-mediated 
      activation of STAT3. This study reveals that LMP1, through its carboxyl-terminal 
      activation domain 1 (LMP1-CTAR1), activates both STAT3 and EGFR in a
      serum-independent manner with constitutive serine phosphorylation of STAT3. Upon 
      treatment with EGF, the LMP1-CTAR1-induced EGFR was additionally phosphorylated
      and STAT3 became phosphorylated on tyrosine, concomitant with upregulation of a
      subset of STAT3 target genes. The kinase responsible for LMP1-CTAR1-mediated
      serine phosphorylation of STAT3 was identified to be PKCδ using specific RNAi, a 
      dominant negative PKCδ, and the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin. Interestingly,
      inhibition of PKCδ also inhibited constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR and
      LMP1-CTAR1-induced phosphorylation of ERK. Inhibition of PKCδ blocked
      LMP1-CTAR1-mediated transformation of Rat-1 cells, likely through the inhibition 
      of ERK activation. These findings indicate that LMP1 activates multiple distinct 
      signaling pathways and suggest that PKCδ functions as a master regulator of EGFR,
      STAT3, and ERK activation by LMP1-CTAR1.

TI  - Targeting p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) to induce apoptosis of tumor cells.
PG  - 7177-82
AB  - p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases that serve as
      important mediators of Rac and Cdc42 GTPase function as well as pathways required
      for Ras-driven tumorigenesis. PAK1 has been implicated in signaling by growth
      factor receptors and morphogenetic processes that control cell polarity,
      invasion, and actin cytoskeleton organization. To better understand the role of
      PAK1 in tumorigenesis, PAK1 genomic copy number and expression were determined
      for a large panel of breast, lung, and head and neck tumors. PAK1 genomic
      amplification at 11q13 was prevalent in luminal breast cancer, and PAK1 protein
      expression was associated with lymph node metastasis. Breast cancer cells with
      PAK1 genomic amplification rapidly underwent apoptosis after inhibition of this
      kinase. Strong nuclear and cytoplasmic PAK1 expression was also prevalent in
      squamous nonsmall cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), and selective PAK1 inhibition
      was associated with delayed cell-cycle progression in vitro and in vivo. NSCLC
      cells were profiled using a library of pathway-targeted small-molecule
      inhibitors, and several synergistic combination therapies, including combination 
      with antagonists of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, were revealed for PAK1. Dual
      inhibition of PAK1 and X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis efficiently
      increased effector caspase activation and apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Together, our
      results provide evidence for dysregulation of PAK1 in breast and squamous NSCLCs 
      and a role for PAK1 in cellular survival and proliferation in these indications.

TI  - Systems Biology in Immunology – A Computational Modeling Perspective.
PG  - 527-85
AB  - Systems biology is an emerging discipline that combines high-content, multiplexed
      measurements with informatic and computational modeling methods to better
      understand biological function at various scales. Here we present a detailed
      review of the methods used to create computational models and conduct simulations
      of immune function, We provide descriptions of the key data gathering techniques 
      employed to generate the quantitative and qualitative data required for such
      modeling and simulation and summarize the progress to date in applying these
      tools and techniques to questions of immunological interest, including infectious
      disease. We include comments on what insights modeling can provide that
      complement information obtained from the more familiar experimental discovery
      methods used by most investigators and why quantitative methods are needed to
      eventually produce a better understanding of immune system operation in health
      and disease.

TI  - Large-scale phosphoproteomic analysis of membrane proteins in renal proximal and 
      distal tubule.
PG  - C755-70
AB  - Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have provided means for large-scale
      phosphoproteomic profiling of specific tissues. Here, we report results from
      large-scale tandem MS [liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS]-based phosphoproteomic
      profiling of biochemically isolated membranes from the renal cortex, with focus
      on transporters and regulatory proteins. Data sets were filtered (by target-decoy
      analysis) to limit false-positive identifications to <2%. A total of 7,125 unique
      nonphosphorylated and 743 unique phosphorylated peptides were identified. Among
      the phosphopeptides identified were sites on transporter proteins, i.e., solute
      carrier (Slc, n = 63), ATP-binding cassette (Abc, n = 4), and aquaporin (Aqp, n =
      3) family proteins. Database searches reveal that a majority of the
      phosphorylation sites identified in transporter proteins were previously
      unreported. Most of the Slc family proteins are apical or basolateral
      transporters expressed in proximal tubule cells, including proteins known to
      mediate transport of glucose, amino acids, organic ions, and inorganic ions. In
      addition, we identified potentially important phosphorylation sites for transport
      proteins from distal nephron segments, including the bumetanide-sensitive
      Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (Slc12a1 or NKCC2) at Ser87, Thr101, and Ser126 and the
      thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (Slc12a3 or NCC) at Ser71 and Ser124. A
      subset of phosphorylation sites in regulatory proteins coincided with known
      functional motifs, suggesting specific regulatory roles. An online database from 
      this study (http://dir.nhlbi.nih.gov/papers/lkem/rcmpd/) provides a resource for 
      future studies of transporter regulation.

TI  - Lessons on transcriptional control from the serum response network.
PG  - 160-6
AB  - Response to environmental stimuli is critical for cell survival and function and 
      requires high fidelity signal transduction into the nucleus to facilitate the
      coordinated transcriptional regulation of appropriate gene networks. The cellular
      response to mitogenic stimuli provides an excellent paradigm to decipher the
      mechanisms mediating precise gene expression control at the transcriptional
      level. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of this so called
      serum response network, which illuminate novel aspects of nuclear signaling
      mechanisms, combinatorial control by DNA binding proteins and regulation of RNA
      polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation.

TI  - Synapse to Nucleus Signaling.
PG  - 345-52
AB  - Signals generated in distal subcellular compartments of neurons must often travel
      long distances to the nucleus to trigger changes in gene expression. This
      retrograde signaling is critical to the development, function and survival of
      neural circuits, and neurons have evolved multiple mechanisms to transmit signals
      over long distances. In this review, we briefly summarize the range of mechanisms
      whereby distally-generated signals are transported to neuronal nuclei. We then
      focus on the transport of soluble signals from the synapse to the nucleus during 
      neuronal plasticity.

TI  - Structure-based Systems Biology for Analyzing Off-target Binding.
PG  - 189-99
AB  - Here off-target binding implies the binding of a small molecule of therapeutic
      interest to a protein target other than the primary target for which it was
      intended. Increasingly such off-targeting appears to be the norm rather than the 
      exception, rational drug design notwithstanding, and can lead to detrimental
      side-effects, or opportunities to reposition a therapeutic agent to treat a
      different condition. Not surprisingly, there is significant interest in
      determining a priori what off-targets exist on a proteome-wide scale. Beyond
      determining putative off-targets is the need to understand the impact of such
      binding on the complete biological system, with the ultimate goal of being able
      to predict the phenotypic outcome. While a very ambitious goal, some progress is 
      being made.

TI  - Diverse protein kinase interactions identified by protein microarrays reveal
      novel connections between cellular processes.
PG  - 767-78
AB  - Protein kinases are key regulators of cellular processes. In spite of
      considerable effort, a full understanding of the pathways they participate in
      remains elusive. We globally investigated the proteins that interact with the
      majority of yeast protein kinases using protein microarrays. Eighty-five kinases 
      were purified and used to probe yeast proteome microarrays.
      One-thousand-twenty-three interactions were identified, and the vast majority
      were novel. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that many of these
      interactions occurred in vivo. Many novel links of kinases to previously distinct
      cellular pathways were discovered. For example, the well-studied Kss1 filamentous
      pathway was found to bind components of diverse cellular pathways, such as those 
      of the stress response pathway and the Ccr4–Not transcriptional/translational
      regulatory complex; genetic tests revealed that these different components
      operate in the filamentation pathway in vivo. Overall, our results indicate that 
      kinases operate in a highly interconnected network that coordinates many
      activities of the proteome. Our results further demonstrate that protein
      microarrays uncover a diverse set of interactions not observed previously.

TI  - Importance of Manual Validation for the Identification of Phosphopeptides Using a
      Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer.
PG  - 10-20
AB  - Accurate determination of protein phosphorylation is challenging, particularly
      for researchers who lack access to a high-accuracy mass spectrometer. In this
      study, multiple protocols were used to enrich phosphopeptides, and a rigorous
      filtering workflow was used to analyze the resulting samples. Phosphopeptides
      were enriched from cultured rat renal proximal tubule cells using three commonly 
      used protocols and a dual method that combines separate immobilized metal
      affinity chromatography (IMAC) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) chromatography, termed
      dual IMAC (DIMAC). Phosphopeptides from all four enrichment strategies were
      analyzed by liquid chromatography-multiple levels of mass spectrometry (LC-MSn)
      neutral-loss scanning using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer. Initially, the
      resulting MS2 and MS3 spectra were analyzed using PeptideProphet and database
      search engine thresholds that produced a false discovery rate (FDR) of <1.5% when
      searched against a reverse database. However, only 40% of the potential
      phosphopeptides were confirmed by manual validation. The combined analyses
      yielded 110 confidently identified phosphopeptides. Using less-stringent initial 
      filtering thresholds (FDR of 7–9%), followed by rigorous manual validation, 262
      unique phosphopeptides, including 111 novel phosphorylation sites, were
      identified confidently. Thus, traditional methods of data filtering within widely
      accepted FDRs were inadequate for the analysis of low-resolution phosphopeptide
      spectra. However, the combination of a streamlined front-end enrichment strategy 
      and rigorous manual spectral validation allowed for confident phosphopeptide
      identifications from a complex sample using a low-resolution ion trap mass
      spectrometer.

TI  - Mitogen activated protein kinase at the nuclear pore complex.
PG  - 928-37
AB  - Mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases control eukaryotic proliferation, and
      import of kinases into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) can
      influence gene expression to affect cellular growth, cell viability and
      homeostatic function. The NPC is a critical regulatory checkpoint for
      nucleocytoplasmic traffic that regulates gene expression and cell growth, and MAP
      kinases may be physically associated with the NPC to modulate transport. In the
      present study, highly enriched NPC fractions were isolated and investigated for
      associated kinases and/or activity. Endogenous kinase activity was identified
      within the NPC fraction, which phosphorylated a 30 kD nuclear pore protein.
      Phosphomodification of this nucleoporin, here termed Nup30, was inhibited by
      apigenin and PD-98059, two MAP kinase antagonists as well as with SB-202190, a
      pharmacological blocker of p38. Furthermore, high throughput profiling of
      enriched NPCs revealed constitutive presence of all members of the MAP kinase
      family, extracellular regulated kinases (ERK), p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase. The
      NPC thus contains a spectrum of associated MAP kinases that suggests an intimate 
      role for ERK and p38 in regulation of nuclear pore function.

TI  - Large Scale Phosphoproteome Profiles Comprehensive Features of Mouse Embryonic
      Stem Cells*.
LID - M110.001750
AB  - Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent and capable of unlimited self-renewal.
      Elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanism may contribute to the
      advancement of cell-based regenerative medicine. In the present work, we
      performed a large scale analysis of the phosphoproteome in mouse embryonic stem
      (mES) cells. Using multiplex strategies, we detected 4581 proteins and 3970 high 
      confidence distinct phosphosites in 1642 phosphoproteins. Notably, 22 prominent
      phosphorylated stem cell marker proteins with 39 novel phosphosites were
      identified for the first time by mass spectrometry, including phosphorylation
      sites in NANOG (Ser-65) and RE1 silencing transcription factor (Ser-950 and
      Thr-953). Quantitative profiles of NANOG peptides obtained during the
      differentiation of mES cells revealed that the abundance of phosphopeptides and
      non-phosphopeptides decreased with different trends. To our knowledge, this study
      presents the largest global characterization of phosphorylation in mES cells.
      Compared with a study of ultimately differentiated tissue cells, a bioinformatics
      analysis of the phosphorylation data set revealed a consistent phosphorylation
      motif in human and mouse ES cells. Moreover, investigations into phosphorylation 
      conservation suggested that phosphoproteins were more conserved in the
      undifferentiated ES cell state than in the ultimately differentiated tissue cell 
      state. However, the opposite conclusion was drawn from this conservation
      comparison with phosphosites. Overall, this work provides an overview of
      phosphorylation in mES cells and is a valuable resource for the future
      understanding of basic biology in mES cells.

TI  - The ERK Cascade: Distinct Functions within Various Subcellular Organelles.
PG  - 195-209
AB  - The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) cascade is a central
      signaling pathway that regulates a wide variety of stimulated cellular processes,
      including mainly proliferation, differentiation, and survival, but apoptosis and 
      stress response as well. The ability of this linear cascade to induce so many
      distinct and even opposing effects after various stimulations raises the question
      as to how the signaling specificity of the cascade is regulated. Over the past
      years, several specificity-mediating mechanisms have been elucidated, including
      temporal regulation, scaffolding interactions, crosstalks with other signaling
      components, substrate competition, and multiple components in each tier of the
      cascade. In addition, spatial regulation of various components of the cascade is 
      probably one of the main ways by which signals can be directed to some downstream
      targets and not to others. In this review, we describe first the components of
      the ERK1/2 cascade and their mode of regulation by kinases, phosphatases, and
      scaffold proteins. In the second part, we focus on the role of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 
      compartmentalization in the nucleus, mitochondria, endosomes, plasma membrane,
      cytoskeleton, and Golgi apparatus. We explain that this spatial distribution may 
      direct ERK1/2 signals to regulate the organelles’ activities. However, it can
      also direct the activity of the cascade’s components to the outer surface of the 
      organelles in order to bring them to close proximity to specific cytoplasmic
      targets. We conclude that the dynamic localization of the ERK1/2 cascade
      components is an important regulatory mechanism in determining the signaling
      specificity of the cascade, and its understanding should shed a new light on the 
      understanding of many stimulus-dependent processes.

AB  - Molecular targeted therapy represents a promising new strategy for treating
      cancers because many small-molecule inhibitors targeting protein kinases have
      recently become available. Reverse-phase protein microarrays (RPPAs) are a useful
      platform for identifying dysregulated signaling pathways in tumors and can
      provide insight into patient-specific differences. In the present study, RPPAs
      were used to examine 60 protein end points (predominantly phosphoproteins) in
      matched tumor and nonmalignant biopsy specimens from 23 patients with head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma to characterize the cancer phosphoproteome. RPPA
      identified 18 of 60 analytes globally elevated in tumors versus healthy tissue
      and 17 of 60 analytes that were decreased. The most significantly elevated
      analytes in tumor were checkpoint kinase (Chk) 1 serine 345 (S345), Chk 2 S33/35,
      eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) S65,
      protein kinase C (PKC) ζ/ι threonine 410/412 (T410/T412), LKB1 S334, inhibitor of
      kappaB alpha (IκB-α) S32, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)
      S209, Smad2 S465/67, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) S612, mitogen-activated
      ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) S217/221, and total PKC ι. To our knowledge, this is the 
      first report of elevated PKC ι in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that may 
      have significance because PKC ι is an oncogene in several other tumor types,
      including lung cancer. The feasibility of using RPPA for developing theranostic
      tests to guide personalized therapy is discussed in the context of these data.

PG  - 4-11
AB  - Protein kinases orchestrate the activation of signalling cascades in response to 
      extracellular and intracellular stimuli to control cell growth, proliferation,
      and survival. The complexity of the numerous intracellular signalling pathways is
      highlighted by the number of kinases encoded by the human genome (539) and the
      plethora of phosphorylation sites identified in phosphoproteomic studies.
      Perturbation of these signalling networks by mutations or abnormal protein
      expression underlies the cause of many diseases including cancer. Recent RNAi
      screens and cancer genomic sequencing studies have revealed that many more
      kinases than anticipated contribute to tumorigenesis and are potential targets
      for inhibitor drug development intervention. This review will highlight recent
      insights into known pathways essential for tumorigenesis and discuss exciting new
      pathways for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Phosphoproteome Analysis Reveals Regulatory Sites in Major Pathways of Cardiac
      Mitochondria*.
LID - M110.000117
AB  - Mitochondrial functions are dynamically regulated in the heart. In particular,
      protein phosphorylation has been shown to be a key mechanism modulating
      mitochondrial function in diverse cardiovascular phenotypes. However,
      site-specific phosphorylation information remains scarce for this organ.
      Accordingly, we performed a comprehensive characterization of murine cardiac
      mitochondrial phosphoproteome in the context of mitochondrial functional
      pathways. A platform using the complementary fragmentation technologies of
      collision-induced dissociation (CID) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD)
      demonstrated successful identification of a total of 236 phosphorylation sites in
      the murine heart; 210 of these sites were novel. These 236 sites were mapped to
      181 phosphoproteins and 203 phosphopeptides. Among those identified, 45
      phosphorylation sites were captured only by CID, whereas 185 phosphorylation
      sites, including a novel modification on ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase protein
      1 (Ser-212), were identified only by ETD, underscoring the advantage of a
      combined CID and ETD approach. The biological significance of the cardiac
      mitochondrial phosphoproteome was evaluated. Our investigations illustrated key
      regulatory sites in murine cardiac mitochondrial pathways as targets of
      phosphorylation regulation, including components of the electron transport chain 
      (ETC) complexes and enzymes involved in metabolic pathways (e.g. tricarboxylic
      acid cycle). Furthermore, calcium overload injured cardiac mitochondrial ETC
      function, whereas enhanced phosphorylation of ETC via application of phosphatase 
      inhibitors restored calcium-attenuated ETC complex I and complex III activities, 
      demonstrating positive regulation of ETC function by phosphorylation. Moreover,
      in silico analyses of the identified phosphopeptide motifs illuminated the
      molecular nature of participating kinases, which included several known
      mitochondrial kinases (e.g. pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) as well as kinases
      whose mitochondrial location was not previously appreciated (e.g. Src). In
      conclusion, the phosphorylation events defined herein advance our understanding
      of cardiac mitochondrial biology, facilitating the integration of the still
      fragmentary knowledge about mitochondrial signaling networks, metabolic pathways,
      and intrinsic mechanisms of functional regulation in the heart.

TI  - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells receive RAF-dependent survival signals in
      response to CXCL12 that are sensitive to inhibition by sorafenib.
PG  - 882-9
AB  - The chemokine CXCL12, via its receptor CXCR4, promotes increased survival of
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells that express high levels of
      ζ-chain–associated protein (ZAP-70), a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with
      aggressive disease. In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular
      mechanisms governing this effect. Although significant differences in the
      expression or turnover of CXCR4 were not observed between ZAP-70+ and ZAP-70−
      cell samples, CXCL12 induced greater intracellular Ca2+ flux and stronger and
      more prolonged phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) in the ZAP-70+ CLL cells. The
      CXCL12-induced phosphorylation of ERK and MEK in ZAP-70+ CLL cells was blocked by
      sorafenib, a small molecule inhibitor of RAF. Furthermore, ZAP-70+ CLL cells were
      more sensitive than ZAP-70− CLL cells to the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib in
      vitro at concentrations that can readily be achieved in vivo. The data suggest
      that ZAP-70+ CLL cells may be more responsive to survival factors, like CXCL12,
      that are elaborated by the leukemia microenvironment, and this sensitivity could 
      be exploited for the development of new treatments for patients with this
      disease. Moreover, sorafenib may have clinical activity for patients with CLL,
      particularly those with ZAP-70+ CLL.

TI  - p190RhoGEF (Rgnef) promotes colon carcinoma tumor progression via interaction
      with focal adhesion kinase.
PG  - 360-70
AB  - Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) functions downstream of integrins and growth factor
      receptors to promote tumor cell motility and invasion. In colorectal cancer, FAK 
      is activated by amidated gastrin, a pro-tumorigenic hormone. However, it is
      unclear how FAK receives signals from the gastrin receptor or other
      G-protein-coupled receptors that can promote cell motility and invasion. The Rho 
      guanine-nucleotide exchange factor p190RhoGEF (Rgnef) binds FAK and facilitates
      fibroblast focal adhesion formation on fibronectin. Here we report that Rgnef
      mRNA and protein expression is significantly increased during colorectal tumor
      progression. In human colon carcinoma cells, Rgnef complexes with FAK and upon
      gastrin stimulation, FAK translocates to newly-forming focal adhesions where it
      facilitates tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. siRNA-mediated knockdown of
      Rgnef or FAK, or pharmacological inhibition of FAK activity, is sufficient to
      block gastrin-stimulated paxillin phosphorylation, cell motility, and invadopodia
      formation in a manner dependent upon upstream cholecystokinin-2 receptor
      expression. Overexpression of the C-terminal region of Rgnef (Rgnef-C, aa
      1279-1582) but not Rgnef-CΔFAK (aa 1302-1582 lacking the FAK binding site)
      disrupted endogenous Rgnef-FAK interaction and prevented paxillin phosphorylation
      and cell motility stimulated by gastrin. Rgnef-C-expressing cells formed smaller,
      less invasive tumors with reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin upon
      orthotopic implantation, compared to Rgnef-CΔFAK-expressing cells. Our studies
      identify Rgnef as a novel regulator of colon carcinoma motility and invasion and 
      they show that a Rgnef-FAK linkage promotes colon carcinoma progression in vivo.

TI  - Finding undetected protein associations in cell signaling by belief propagation.
PG  - 882-7
AB  - External information propagates in the cell mainly through signaling cascades and
      transcriptional activation, allowing it to react to a wide spectrum of
      environmental changes. High-throughput experiments identify numerous molecular
      components of such cascades that may, however, interact through unknown partners.
      Some of them may be detected using data coming from the integration of a
      protein–protein interaction network and mRNA expression profiles. This inference 
      problem can be mapped onto the problem of finding appropriate optimal connected
      subgraphs of a network defined by these datasets. The optimization procedure
      turns out to be computationally intractable in general. Here we present a new
      distributed algorithm for this task, inspired from statistical physics, and apply
      this scheme to alpha factor and drug perturbations data in yeast. We identify the
      role of the COS8 protein, a member of a gene family of previously unknown
      function, and validate the results by genetic experiments. The algorithm we
      present is specially suited for very large datasets, can run in parallel, and can
      be adapted to other problems in systems biology. On renowned benchmarks it
      outperforms other algorithms in the field.

TI  - Phosphorylated hMSH6: DNA mismatch versus DNA damage recognition.
PG  - 36-45
AB  - DNA mismatch repair (MMR) maintains genomic integrity by correction of mispaired 
      bases and insertion-deletion loops. The MMR pathway can also trigger a DNA damage
      response upon binding of MutSα to specific DNA lesions such as O6methylguanine
      (O6meG). Limited information is available regarding cellular regulation of these 
      two different pathways. Within this report, we demonstrate that phosphorylated
      hMSH6 increases in concentration in the presence of a G:T mismatch, as compared
      to an O6meG:T lesion. TPA, a kinase activator, enhances the phosphorylation of
      hMSH6 and binding of hMutSα to a G:T mismatch, though not to O6meG:T. UCN-01, a
      kinase inhibitor, decreases both phosphorylation of hMSH6 and binding of hMutSα
      to G:T and O6meG:T. HeLa MR cells, pretreated with UCN-01 and exposed to MNNG,
      undergo activation of Cdk1 and mitosis despite phosphorylation of Chk1 and
      inactivating phosphorylation of Cdc25c. These results indicate that UCN-01 may
      inhibit an alternative cell cycle arrest pathway associated with the MMR pathway 
      that does not involve Cdc25c. In addition, recombinant hMutSα containing hMSH6
      mutated at an N-terminal cluster of 4 phosphoserines exhibits decreased
      phosphorylation and decreased binding of hMutSα to G:T and O6meG:T. Taken
      together, these results suggest a model in which the amount of phosphorylated
      hMSH6 bound to DNA is dependent on the presence of either a DNA mismatch or DNA
      alkylation damage. We hypothesize that both phosphorylation of hMSH6 and total
      concentration of bound hMutSα are involved in cellular signaling of either DNA
      mismatch repair or MMR-dependent damage recognition activities.

TI  - Mass spectrometry mapping of epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation
      related to oncogenic mutations and tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitivity.
PG  - 305-19
AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in cancer by 
      activating downstream signals important in growth and survival. Inhibitors of
      EGFR are frequently selected as treatment for cancer including lung cancer. We
      performed an unbiased and comprehensive search for EGFR phosphorylation events
      related to somatic activating mutations and EGFR inhibitor (erlotinib)
      sensitivity. EGFR immunoprecipitation combined with high resolution liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry and label free quantitation characterized EGFR
      phosphorylation. Thirty (30) phosphorylation sites were identified including 12
      tyrosine (pY), 12 serine (pS), and 6 threonine (pT). Site-specific
      phosphorylation was monitored by comparing ion signals from the corresponding
      unmodified peptide. Phosphorylation sites related to activating mutations in EGFR
      as well as sensitivity to erlotinib were identified using 31 lung cancer cell
      lines. We identified three sites (pY1092, pY1110, pY1172) correlating with
      activating mutations while three sites (pY1110, pY1172, pY1197) correlated with
      erlotinib sensitivity. Five sites (pT693, pY1092, pY1110, pY1172 and pY1197) were
      inhibited by erlotinib in concentration-dependent manner. Erlotinib sensitivity
      was confirmed using liquid chromatography coupled to multiple reaction monitoring
      (LC-MRM) and quantitative western blotting. This LC-MS/MS strategy can
      quantitatively assess site-specific EGFR phosphorylation and can identify
      relationships between somatic mutations or drug sensitivity and protein
      phosphorylation.

PG  - 293-305
AB  - The stimulation of various cellular processes through extracellular signals is of
      paramount importance in biological systems and is a central focus in the
      diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. The information transfer is
      accomplished in a variety of ways by the interaction of soluble,
      matrix-associated and cell bound ligands that either bind specifically to plasma 
      membrane-associated proteins that act as receptors, or penetrate to the
      cytoplasmic/nuclear compartments to bind and activate receptors located there.
      The former class of entities generates intracellular signals that are transmitted
      and amplified by chemical modifications that are manifested as protein
      post-translational modifications (PTMs). These are both reversible and
      irreversible and range from phosphorylation of tyrosine, threonine and serine
      residues to endoproteolytic cleavages. Although the PTMs alter the activity and
      functions of many of the proteins in these cascades, the major outcomes of most
      of the signaling pathways are the activation/deactivation of transcriptional
      regulators with the concomitant changes in gene expression that generally
      underlie biological responses.

AB  - The functionally important regions of signal proteins participating in their
      specific interaction and responsible for transduction of hormonal signal into
      cell are rather short in length, having, as a rule, 8 to 20 amino acid residues. 
      Synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions are able to mimic the activated
      form of full-size signal protein and to trigger signaling cascades in the absence
      of hormonal stimulus. They modulate protein-protein interaction and influence the
      activity of signal proteins followed by changes in their regulatory and catalytic
      sites. The present review is devoted to the achievements and perspectives of the 
      study of signal protein-derived peptides and to their application as selective
      and effective regulators of hormonal signaling systems in vitro and in vivo.
      Attention is focused on the structure, biological activity, and molecular
      mechanisms of action of peptides, derivatives of the receptors, G protein α
      subunits, and the enzymes generating second messengers.

TI  - A Self-validating Quantitative Mass Spectrometry Method for Assessing the
      Accuracy of High-content Phosphoproteomic Experiments*.
LID - M110.003079
AB  - Protein kinase pathways play pivotal roles in cell signaling and biology. The
      phosphoproteome is a reflection of protein kinase pathway activation and
      therefore there is considerable interest in its quantification as a means to
      assess the wiring of signaling networks. Although different approaches for
      quantitative phosphoproteomics have been described, there is no data on how
      accurate these are for each quantified phosphorylated site. We report a liquid
      chromatography-MS approach to objectively assess data quality in high-content
      comparison of phosphoproteomes in which samples to be compared are mixed at
      different proportions. The experimental data is then used to derive a linear
      regression function that allows calculating correlation values, linearity, and
      accuracy. We applied the technique to investigate phosphorylation in P31/Fuj and 
      Kasumi-1, two leukemia cells lines showing strikingly different sensitivities to 
      scr and PI3K inhibitors. We found that phosphopeptides quantified with accuracy
      were not always quantified with precision because of low ion statistics
      contributing to variability. Thus our approach was complementary to standard
      methods for calculating the precision of replicate measurements based on the
      coefficient of variation and provided additional information on data quality for 
      each quantified phosphopeptide. We quantified > 2250 phosphorylation sites across
      cell lines with different levels of sensitivity to kinase inhibitors, of which
      1847 showed an accuracy variation of < 30% (with an overall mean of 22%).
      Hundreds of phosphorylation sites on proteins with diverse function (including
      kinases, transcription, and translation factors) showed significantly distinct
      intensities across sensitive and resistant cells lines, indicating that kinase
      pathways are differentially regulated in cancer cells of distinct sensitivity to 
      signaling inhibitors.

TI  - Quantitative Protein and mRNA Profiling Shows Selective Post-Transcriptional
      Control of Protein Expression by Vasopressin in Kidney Cells*.
LID - M110.004036
AB  - Previous studies in yeast have supported the view that post-transcriptional
      regulation of protein abundances may be more important than previously believed. 
      Here we ask the question: “In a physiological regulatory process (the response of
      mammalian kidney cells to the hormone vasopressin), what fraction of the
      expressed proteome undergoes a change in abundance and what fraction of the
      regulated proteins have corresponding changes in mRNA levels?” In humans and
      other mammals, vasopressin fulfills a vital homeostatic role (viz. regulation of 
      renal water excretion) by regulating the water channel aquaporin-2 in collecting 
      duct cells. To address the question posed, we utilized large-scale quantitative
      protein mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) employing stable isotopic labeling in
      cultured mpkCCD cells (‘SILAC’) coupled with transcriptomic profiling using
      oligonucleotide expression arrays (Affymetrix). Preliminary studies analyzing two
      nominally identical control samples by SILAC LC-MS/MS yielded a relative S.D. of 
      13% (for ratios), establishing the precision of the SILAC approach in our hands. 
      We quantified nearly 3000 proteins with nontargeted SILAC LC-MS/MS, comparing
      vasopressin- versus vehicle-treated samples. Of these proteins 786 of them were
      quantified in each of 3 experiments, allowing statistical analysis and 188 of
      these showed significant vasopressin-induced changes in abundance, including
      aquaporin-2 (20-fold increase). Among the proteins with statistically significant
      abundance changes, a large fraction (at least one-third) was found to lack
      changes in the corresponding mRNA species (despite sufficient statistical power),
      indicating that post-transcriptional regulation of protein abundance plays an
      important role in the vasopressin response. Bioinformatic analysis of the
      regulated proteins (versus all transcripts) shows enrichment of glutathione
      S-transferase isoforms as well as proteins involved in organization of the actin 
      cytoskeleton. The latter suggests that long-term regulatory processes may
      contribute to actomyosin-dependent trafficking of the water channel aquaporin-2. 
      The results provide impetus for increased focus on translational regulation and
      regulation of protein degradation in physiological control in mammalian
      epithelial cells.

TI  - Steroid hormone inactivation is required during the juvenile-adult transition in 
      Drosophila.
PG  - 895-902
AB  - Steroid hormones are systemic signaling molecules that regulate juvenile-adult
      transitions in both insects and mammals. In insects, pulses of the steroid
      hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) are generated by increased biosynthesis followed
      by inactivation/clearance. Although mechanisms that control 20E synthesis have
      received considerable recent attention, the physiological significance of 20E
      inactivation remains largely unknown. We show that the cytochrome P450 Cyp18a1
      lowers 20E titer during the Drosophila prepupal to pupal transition. Furthermore,
      this reduction of 20E levels is a prerequisite to induce βFTZ-F1, a key factor in
      the genetic hierarchy that controls early metamorphosis. Resupplying βFTZ-F1
      rescues Cyp18a1-deficient prepupae. Since Cyp18a1 is 20E-inducible, it appears
      that the increased production of steroid is responsible for its eventual decline,
      thereby generating the regulatory pulse required for proper temporal progression 
      of metamorphosis. The coupling of hormone clearance to βFTZ-F1 expression
      suggests a general mechanism by which transient signaling drives unidirectional
      progression through a multistep process.

      Disulphide-Thiol-Interchange Covalent Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 19-33
AB  - Thus far only a handful of phosphoproteins with important biological functions
      have been identified and characterized in oral fluids and these include some of
      the abundant protein constituents of saliva. Whole saliva (WS) samples were
      trypsin digested followed by chemical derivatization using dithiothreitol (DTT)
      of the phospho-serine/threonine containing peptides. The DTT-phosphopeptides were
      enriched by covalent disulphide-thiol-interchange chromatography and analysis by 
      nano-flow LC-ESI-MS/MS. The specificity of DTT chemical derivatization was
      evaluated separately under different base-catalyzed conditions with NaOH and
      Ba(OH)2, blocking cysteine residues by iodoacetamide and enzymatic
      O-deglycosylation prior to DTT reaction. Further analysis of WS samples which
      were subjected to either of these conditions provided supporting evidence for
      phosphoprotein identifications. The combined chemical strategies and mass
      spectrometric analyses identified 65 phosphoproteins in WS of which 28 were based
      on two or more peptide identification criteria with high confidence, and 37 were 
      based on a single phosphopeptide identification. Most of the identified proteins,
      ~80%, were hitherto unknown phosphoprotein components. This study represents the 
      first large-scale documentation of phosphoproteins of WS. The origins and
      identity of WS phosphoproteome suggest significant implications for both basic
      science and the development of novel biomarkers/diagnostic tools for both
      systemic and oral disease states.

AB  - Reversible protein phosphorylation serves as a basis for regulating a number of
      cellular processes. Aberrant activation of kinase signaling pathways is commonly 
      associated with several cancers. Recent developments in
      phosphoprotein/phosphopeptide enrichment strategies and quantitative mass
      spectrometry have resulted in robust pipelines for high-throughput
      characterization of phosphorylation in a global fashion. Today, it is possible to
      profile site-specific phosphorylation events on thousands of proteins in a single
      experiment. The potential of this approach is already being realized to
      characterize signaling pathways that govern oncogenesis. In addition, chemical
      proteomic strategies have been used to unravel targets of kinase inhibitors,
      which are otherwise difficult to characterize. This review summarizes various
      approaches used for analysis of the phosphoproteome in general, and protein
      kinases in particular, highlighting key cancer phosphoproteomic studies.

PG  - 983-92
AB  - β-Adrenergic and angiotensin II type 1A receptors are therapeutic targets for the
      treatment of a number of common human diseases. Pharmacological agents designed
      as antagonists for these receptors have positively affected the morbidity and
      mortality of patients with hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease.
      Antagonism of these receptors, however, may only partially explain the
      therapeutic benefits of β-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers given the
      emerging concept of functional selectivity or biased agonism. This new
      pharmacological paradigm suggests that multiple signaling pathways can be
      differentially modified by a single ligand-receptor interaction. This review
      examines the functional selectivity of β-adrenergic and angiotensin II type 1A
      receptors with respect to their ability to signal via both G protein-dependent
      and G protein-independent mechanisms, with a focus on the multifunctional protein
      β-arrestin. Also highlighted are the concept of “biased signaling” through
      β-arrestin mediated pathways, the affect of ligand/receptor modification on such 
      biased agonism, and the implications of functional selectivity for the
      development of the next generation of β-blockers and angiotensin receptor
      blockers.

TI  - Regulation of glycogen metabolism in yeast and bacteria.
PG  - 952-85
AB  - Microorganisms have the capacity to utilize a variety of nutrients and adapt to
      continuously changing environmental conditions. Many microorganisms, including
      yeast and bacteria, accumulate carbon and energy reserves to cope with starvation
      conditions temporarily present in the environment. Glycogen biosynthesis is a
      main strategy for such metabolic storage and a variety of sensing and signaling
      mechanisms have evolved in evolutionarily distant species to guarantee the
      production of this homopolysaccharide. At the most fundamental level, the
      processes of glycogen synthesis and degradation in yeast and bacteria share
      certain broad similarities. However, the regulation of these processes is
      sometimes quite distinct, indicating that they have evolved separately to respond
      optimally to the habitat conditions of each species. This review aims to
      highlight the mechanisms, both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional
      levels, which regulate glycogen metabolism in yeast and bacteria, focusing on
      selected areas where the greatest increase in knowledge has occurred during the
      last few years. In the yeast system, we focus particularly on the various
      signaling pathways that control the activity of the enzymes of glycogen storage. 
      We also discuss our recent understanding of the important role played by the
      vacuole in glycogen metabolism. In the case of bacterial glycogen, especial
      emphasis is given to aspects related with genetic regulation of glycogen
      metabolism and its connection with other biological processes.

TI  - Glycoprotein Capture and Quantitative Phosphoproteomics Indicate Coordinated
      Regulation of Cell Migration upon Lysophosphatidic Acid Stimulation*.
PG  - 2337-53
AB  - The lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a serum component that
      regulates cellular functions such as proliferation, migration, and survival via
      specific G protein-coupled receptors. The underlying signaling mechanisms are
      still incompletely understood, including those that operate at the plasma
      membrane to modulate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in LPA-promoted cell 
      migration. To explore LPA-evoked phosphoregulation with a focus on cell surface
      proteins, we combined glycoproteome enrichment by immobilized lectins with
      SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics. We performed biological replicate
      analyses in SCC-9 squamous cell carcinoma cells and repeatedly quantified the
      effect of 1.5- and 5-min LPA treatment on more than 700 distinct phosphorylations
      in lectin-purified proteins. We detected many regulated phosphorylation events on
      various types of plasma membrane proteins such as cell adhesion molecules
      constituting adherens junctions, desmosomes, and hemidesmosomes. Several of these
      LPA-regulated phosphorylation sites have been characterized in a biological
      context other than G protein-coupled receptor signaling, and the transfer of this
      functional information suggests coordinated and multifactorial cell adhesion
      control in LPA-induced cell migration. Additionally, we identified LPA-mediated
      activation loop phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase Wnk1 and verified 
      a role of Wnk1 for LPA-induced cell migration in knock-down experiments. In
      conclusion, the glycoproteome phosphoproteomics strategy described here sheds
      light on incompletely understood mechanisms in LPA-induced cell migratory
      behavior.

TI  - Multiple Decisive Phosphorylation Sites for the Negative Feedback Regulation of
      SOS1 via ERK*.
PG  - 33540-8
AB  - EGF-induced activation of ERK has been extensively studied by both experimental
      and theoretical approaches. Here, we used a simulation model based mostly on
      experimentally determined parameters to study the ERK-mediated negative feedback 
      regulation of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, son of sevenless (SOS).
      Because SOS1 is phosphorylated at multiple serine residues upon stimulation, we
      evaluated the role of the multiplicity by building two simulation models, which
      we termed the decisive and cooperative phosphorylation models. The two models
      were constrained by the duration of Ras activation and basal phosphorylation
      level of SOS1. Possible solutions were found only in the decisive model wherein
      at least three, and probably more than four, phosphorylation sites decisively
      suppress the SOS activity. Thus, the combination of experimental approaches and
      the model analysis has suggested an unexpected role of multiple phosphorylations 
      of SOS1 in the negative regulation.

TI  - Ephrin-B1 forward signaling regulates craniofacial morphogenesis by controlling
      cell proliferation across Eph–ephrin boundaries.
PG  - 2068-80
AB  - Mutations in the X-linked human EPHRIN-B1 gene result in cleft palate and other
      craniofacial anomalies as part of craniofrontonasal syndrome (CFNS), but the
      molecular and developmental mechanisms by which ephrin-B1 controls the underlying
      developmental processes are not clear. Here we demonstrate that ephrin-B1 plays
      an intrinsic role in palatal shelf outgrowth in the mouse by regulating cell
      proliferation in the anterior palatal shelf mesenchyme. In ephrin-B1 heterozygous
      mutants, X inactivation generates ephrin-B1-expressing and -nonexpressing cells
      that sort out, resulting in mosaic ephrin-B1 expression. We now show that this
      process leads to mosaic disruption of cell proliferation and post-transcriptional
      up-regulation of EphB receptor expression through relief of endocytosis and
      degradation. The alteration in proliferation rates resulting from ectopic
      Eph–ephrin expression boundaries correlates with the more severe dysmorphogenesis
      of ephrin-B1+/− heterozygotes that is a hallmark of CFNS. Finally, by integrating
      phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we show that ephrin-B1 controls
      proliferation in the palate by regulating the extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signal transduction pathway.

AB  - The power of proteomics allows unparalleled opportunity to query the molecular
      mechanisms of a malignant cell and the tumor microenvironment in patients with
      ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. This information has given us insight into
      the perturbations of signaling pathways within tumor cells and has aided the
      discovery of new drug targets for the tumor and possible prognostic indicators of
      outcome and disease response to therapy. Proteomics analysis of serum and ascites
      has also given us sources with which to discover possible early markers for the
      presence of new disease and for the progression of established cancer throughout 
      the course of treatment. Unfortunately, this wealth of information has yielded
      little to date in changing the clinical care of these patients from a diagnostic,
      prognostic, or treatment perspective. The rational examination and translation of
      proteomics data in the context of past clinical trials and the design of future
      clinical trials must occur before we can march forward into the future of
      personalized medicine.

TI  - The Ca2+-dependent protein kinase CPK3 is required for MAPK-independent
      salt-stress acclimation in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 484-98
AB  - Plants use different signalling pathways to respond to external stimuli.
      Intracellular signalling via calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) or
      mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) present two major pathways that are
      widely used to react to a changing environment. Both CDPK and MAPK pathways are
      known to be involved in the signalling of abiotic and biotic stresses in animal, 
      yeast and plant cells. Here, we show the essential function of the CDPK CPK3
      (At4g23650) for salt stress acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana, and test
      crosstalk between CPK3 and the major salt-stress activated MAPKs MPK4 and MPK6 in
      the salt stress response. CPK3 kinase activity was induced by salt and other
      stresses after transient overexpression in Arabidopsis protoplasts, but
      endogenous CPK3 appeared to be constitutively active in roots and leaves in a
      strictly Ca2+-dependent manner. cpk3 mutants show a salt-sensitive phenotype
      comparable with mutants in MAPK pathways. In contrast to animal cells, where
      crosstalk between Ca2+ and MAPK signalling is well established, CPK3 seems to act
      independently of those pathways. Salt-induced transcriptional induction of known 
      salt stress-regulated and MAPK-dependent marker genes was not altered, whereas
      post-translational protein phosphorylation patterns from roots of wild type and
      cpk3 plants revealed clear differences. A significant portion of CPK3 was found
      to be associated with the plasma membrane and the vacuole, both depending on its 
      N-terminal myristoylation. An initial proteomic study led to the identification
      of 28 potential CPK3 targets, predominantly membrane-associated proteins.

TI  - Studies of Phosphoproteomic Changes Induced by Nucleophosmin-Anaplastic Lymphoma 
      Kinase (ALK) Highlight Deregulation of Tumor Necrosis Factor
      (TNF)/Fas/TNF-related Apoptosis-induced Ligand Signaling Pathway in ALK-positive 
      Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma*.
PG  - 1616-32
AB  - The oncogenic fusion protein nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK), 
      found exclusively in a subset of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma,
      promotes tumorigenesis by exerting its constitutively active tyrosine kinase
      activity. Thus, characterization of the NPM-ALK-induced changes in the
      phosphoproteome will likely provide insights into the biology of this
      oncoprotein. To achieve this goal, we used a strategy of combining sequential
      affinity purification of phosphopeptides and LC/MS. GP293 cells transfected with 
      either NPM-ALK or an NPM-ALK mutant with decreased tyrosine kinase activity
      (negative control) were used. We identified 506 phosphoproteins detectable in
      NPM-ALK-expressing cells but not in the negative control. Bioinformatics analysis
      revealed that these phosphoproteins carry a wide diversity of biological
      functions, some of which have not been described in association with NPM-ALK,
      such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/Fas/tumor necrosis factor-related
      apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) signaling pathway and the ubiquitin proteasome
      degradation pathway. In particular, modulations of the TNF/Fas/TRAIL pathway by
      NPM-ALK were supported by our antibody microarray data. Further validation of the
      TNF/Fas/TRAIL pathway was performed in ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)
      cell lines with knockdown of NPM-ALK using short interference RNA, resulting in
      the loss of the tyrosine phosphorylation of tumor necrosis factor
      receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) and receptor-interacting protein 1, two
      crucial TNF signaling molecules. Functional analyses revealed that knockdown of
      TRAP1 facilitated cell death induced by TRAIL or doxorubicin in ALK+ ALCL cells. 
      This suggests that down-regulation of TRAP1 in combination with TRAIL or
      doxorubicin might be a potential novel therapeutic strategy for ALK+ ALCL. These 
      findings demonstrated that our strategy allowed the identification of novel
      proteins downstream of NPM-ALK that contribute to the maintenance of neoplastic
      phenotype and holds great potential for future studies of cellular tyrosine
      kinases in normal states and diseases.
