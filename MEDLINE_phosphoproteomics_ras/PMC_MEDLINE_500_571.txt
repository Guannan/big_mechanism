TI  - Phosphorylation Site Dynamics of Early T-cell Receptor Signaling.
LID - e104240
AB  - In adaptive immune responses, T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling impacts multiple
      cellular processes and results in T-cell differentiation, proliferation, and
      cytokine production. Although individual protein–protein interactions and
      phosphorylation events have been studied extensively, we lack a systems-level
      understanding of how these components cooperate to control signaling dynamics,
      especially during the crucial first seconds of stimulation. Here, we used
      quantitative proteomics to characterize reshaping of the T-cell phosphoproteome
      in response to TCR/CD28 co-stimulation, and found that diverse dynamic patterns
      emerge within seconds. We detected phosphorylation dynamics as early as 5 s and
      observed widespread regulation of key TCR signaling proteins by 30 s. Development
      of a computational model pointed to the presence of novel regulatory mechanisms
      controlling phosphorylation of sites with central roles in TCR signaling. The
      model was used to generate predictions suggesting unexpected roles for the
      phosphatase PTPN6 (SHP-1) and shortcut recruitment of the actin regulator WAS.
      Predictions were validated experimentally. This integration of proteomics and
      modeling illustrates a novel, generalizable framework for solidifying
      quantitative understanding of a signaling network and for elucidating missing
      links.

TI  - SPO24 Is a Transcriptionally Dynamic, Small ORF-Encoding Locus Required for
      Efficient Sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
LID - e105058
AB  - In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiosis and sporulation are highly regulated
      responses that are driven in part by changes in RNA expression. Alternative mRNA 
      forms with extended 5′ UTRs are atypical in S. cerevisiae, and 5′ extensions with
      upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are even more unusual. Here we characterize 
      the gene YPR036W-A, now renamed SPO24, which encodes a very small (67-amino-acid)
      protein. This gene gives rise to two mRNA forms: a shorter form throughout
      meiosis and a longer, 5′-extended form in mid-late meiosis. The latter form
      includes a uORF for a 14-amino-acid peptide (Spo24u14). Deletion of the
      downstream ORF (dORF) leads to sporulation defects and the appearance of
      pseudohyphae-like projections. Experiments with luciferase reporters indicate
      that the uORF does not downregulate dORF translation. The protein encoded by the 
      dORF (Spo24d67) localizes to the prospore membrane and is differentially
      phosphorylated during meiosis. Transcription of the 5′-extended mRNA in
      mid-meiosis depends upon the presence of two middle sporulation elements (MSEs). 
      Removal of the MSEs severely inhibits the mid-meiotic appearance of the
      5′-extended mRNA and limits the ability of plasmid-borne SPO24 to rescue the
      sporulation defect of a spo24Δ mutant, suggesting that the 5′-extended mRNA is
      functionally important. These results reveal Spo24d67 as a sporulation-related
      factor that is encoded by a transcriptionally dynamic, uORF-containing locus.

TI  - Identification of Significant Features by the Global Mean Rank Test.
LID - e104504
AB  - With the introduction of omics-technologies such as transcriptomics and
      proteomics, numerous methods for the reliable identification of significantly
      regulated features (genes, proteins, etc.) have been developed. Experimental
      practice requires these tests to successfully deal with conditions such as small 
      numbers of replicates, missing values, non-normally distributed expression
      levels, and non-identical distributions of features. With the MeanRank test we
      aimed at developing a test that performs robustly under these conditions, while
      favorably scaling with the number of replicates. The test proposed here is a
      global one-sample location test, which is based on the mean ranks across
      replicates, and internally estimates and controls the false discovery rate.
      Furthermore, missing data is accounted for without the need of imputation. In
      extensive simulations comparing MeanRank to other frequently used methods, we
      found that it performs well with small and large numbers of replicates, feature
      dependent variance between replicates, and variable regulation across features on
      simulation data and a recent two-color microarray spike-in dataset. The tests
      were then used to identify significant changes in the phosphoproteomes of cancer 
      cells induced by the kinase inhibitors erlotinib and 3-MB-PP1 in two
      independently published mass spectrometry-based studies. MeanRank outperformed
      the other global rank-based methods applied in this study. Compared to the
      popular Significance Analysis of Microarrays and Linear Models for Microarray
      methods, MeanRank performed similar or better. Furthermore, MeanRank exhibits
      more consistent behavior regarding the degree of regulation and is robust against
      the choice of preprocessing methods. MeanRank does not require any imputation of 
      missing values, is easy to understand, and yields results that are easy to
      interpret. The software implementing the algorithm is freely available for
      academic and commercial use.

TI  - Salt-Induced Changes in Cardiac Phosphoproteome in a Rat Model of Chronic Renal
      Failure.
LID - e100331
AB  - Heart damage is widely present in patients with chronic kidney disease. Salt diet
      is the most important environmental factor affecting development of chronic renal
      failure and cardiovascular diseases. The proteins involved in chronic kidney
      disease -induced heart damage, especially their posttranslational modifications, 
      remain largely unknown to date. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy
      (chronic renal failure model) or sham operation were treated for 2 weeks with a
      normal-(0.4% NaCl), or high-salt (4% NaCl) diet. We employed TiO2 enrichment,
      iTRAQ labeling and liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry strategy for
      phosphoproteomic profiling of left ventricular free walls in these animals. A
      total of 1724 unique phosphopeptides representing 2551 non-redundant
      phosphorylation sites corresponding to 763 phosphoproteins were identified.
      During normal salt feeding, 89 (54%) phosphopeptides upregulated and 76 (46%)
      phosphopeptides downregulated in chronic renal failure rats relative to sham
      rats. In chronic renal failure rats, high salt intake induced upregulation of 84 
      (49%) phosphopeptides and downregulation of 88 (51%) phosphopeptides. Database
      searches revealed that most of the identified phospholproteins were important
      signaling molecules such as protein kinases, receptors and phosphatases. These
      phospholproteins were involved in energy metabolism, cell communication, cell
      differentiation, cell death and other biological processes. The Search Tool for
      the Retrieval of Interacting Genes analysis revealed functional links among 15
      significantly regulated phosphoproteins in chronic renal failure rats compared to
      sham group, and 23 altered phosphoproteins induced by high salt intake. The
      altered phosphorylation levels of two proteins involved in heart damage, lamin A 
      and phospholamban were validated. Expression of the downstream genes of these two
      proteins, desmin and SERCA2a, were also analyzed.

TI  - Predicting Kinase Activity in Angiotensin Receptor Phosphoproteomes Based on
      Sequence-Motifs and Interactions.
LID - e94672
AB  - Recent progress in the understanding of seven-transmembrane receptor (7TMR)
      signalling has promoted the development of a new generation of pathway selective 
      ligands. The angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1aR) is one of the most studied
      7TMRs with respect to selective activation of the β-arrestin dependent
      signalling. Two complimentary global phosphoproteomics studies have analyzed the 
      complex signalling induced by the AT1aR. Here we integrate the data sets from
      these studies and perform a joint analysis using a novel method for prediction of
      differential kinase activity from phosphoproteomics data. The method builds upon 
      NetworKIN, which applies sophisticated linear motif analysis in combination with 
      contextual network modelling to predict kinase-substrate associations with high
      accuracy and sensitivity. These predictions form the basis for subsequently
      nonparametric statistical analysis to identify likely activated kinases. This
      suggested that AT1aR-dependent signalling activates 48 of the 285 kinases
      detected in HEK293 cells. Of these, Aurora B, CLK3 and PKG1 have not previously
      been described in the pathway whereas others, such as PKA, PKB and PKC, are well 
      known. In summary, we have developed a new method for kinase-centric analysis of 
      phosphoproteomes to pinpoint differential kinase activity in large-scale data
      sets.

TI  - Quantification of Pancreatic Cancer Proteome and Phosphorylome: Indicates
      Molecular Events Likely Contributing to Cancer and Activity of Drug Targets.
LID - e90948
AB  - Objective: LC-MS/MS phospho-proteomics is an essential technology to help unravel
      the complex molecular events that lead to and propagate cancer. We have developed
      a global phospho-proteomic workflow to determine activity of signaling pathways
      and drug targets in pancreatic cancer tissue for clinical application. Methods:
      Peptides resulting from tryptic digestion of proteins extracted from frozen
      tissue of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and background pancreas (n = 12), were
      labelled with tandem mass tags (TMT 8-plex), separated by strong cation exchange 
      chromatography, then were analysed by LC-MS/MS directly or first enriched for
      phosphopeptides using IMAC and TiO2, prior to analysis. In-house, commercial and 
      freeware bioinformatic platforms were used to identify relevant biological events
      from the complex dataset. Results: Of 2,101 proteins identified, 152 demonstrated
      significant difference in abundance between tumor and non-tumor tissue. They
      included proteins that are known to be up-regulated in pancreatic cancer (e.g.
      Mucin-1), but the majority were new candidate markers such as HIPK1 & MLCK. Of
      the 6,543 unique phosphopeptides identified (6,284 unique phosphorylation sites),
      635 showed significant regulation, particularly those from proteins involved in
      cell migration (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors & MRCKα) and formation of
      focal adhesions. Activator phosphorylation sites on FYN, AKT1, ERK2, HDAC1 and
      other drug targets were found to be highly modulated (≥2 fold) in different cases
      highlighting their predictive power. Conclusion: Here we provided critical
      information enabling us to identify the common and unique molecular events likely
      contributing to cancer in each case. Such information may be used to help predict
      more bespoke therapy suitable for an individual case.

TI  - Searching for Novel Cdk5 Substrates in Brain by Comparative Phosphoproteomics of 
      Wild Type and Cdk5−/− Mice.
LID - e90363
AB  - Protein phosphorylation is the most common post-translational modification that
      regulates several pivotal functions in cells. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is
      a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase which is mostly active in the nervous 
      system. It regulates several biological processes such as neuronal migration,
      cytoskeletal dynamics, axonal guidance and synaptic plasticity among others. In
      search for novel substrates of Cdk5 in the brain we performed quantitative
      phosphoproteomics analysis, isolating phosphoproteins from whole brain derived
      from E18.5 Cdk5+/+ and Cdk5−/− embryos, using an Immobilized Metal-Ion Affinity
      Chromatography (IMAC), which specifically binds to phosphorylated proteins. The
      isolated phosphoproteins were eluted and isotopically labeled for relative and
      absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and mass spectrometry identification. We found 40
      proteins that showed decreased phosphorylation at Cdk5−/− brains. In addition,
      out of these 40 hypophosphorylated proteins we characterized two proteins,
      :MARCKS (Myristoylated Alanine-Rich protein Kinase C substrate) and Grin1 (G
      protein regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1). MARCKS is known to be
      phosphorylated by Cdk5 in chick neural cells while Grin1 has not been reported to
      be phosphorylated by Cdk5. When these proteins were overexpressed in N2A
      neuroblastoma cell line along with p35, serine phosphorylation in their Cdk5
      motifs was found to be increased. In contrast, treatments with roscovitine, the
      Cdk5 inhibitor, resulted in an opposite effect on serine phosphorylation in N2A
      cells and primary hippocampal neurons transfected with MARCKS. In summary, the
      results presented here identify Grin 1 as novel Cdk5 substrate and confirm
      previously identified MARCKS as a a bona fide Cdk5 substrate.

TI  - High and Low Doses of Ionizing Radiation Induce Different Secretome Profiles in a
      Human Skin Model.
LID - e92332
AB  - It is postulated that secreted soluble factors are important contributors of
      bystander effect and adaptive responses observed in low dose ionizing radiation. 
      Using multidimensional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based proteomics, 
      we quantified the changes of skin tissue secretome – the proteins secreted from a
      full thickness, reconstituted 3-dimensional skin tissue model 48 hr after
      exposure to 3, 10 and 200 cGy of X-rays. Overall, 135 proteins showed statistical
      significant difference between the sham (0 cGy) and any of the irradiated groups 
      (3, 10 or 200 cGy) on the basis of Dunnett adjusted t-test; among these, 97
      proteins showed a trend of downregulation and 9 proteins showed a trend of
      upregulation with increasing radiation dose. In addition, there were 21 and 8
      proteins observed to have irregular trends with the 10 cGy irradiated group
      either having the highest or the lowest level among all three radiated doses.
      Moreover, two proteins, carboxypeptidase E and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal
      hydrolase isozyme L1 were sensitive to ionizing radiation, but relatively
      independent of radiation dose. Conversely, proteasome activator complex subunit 2
      protein appeared to be sensitive to the dose of radiation, as rapid upregulation 
      of this protein was observed when radiation doses were increased from 3, to 10 or
      200 cGy. These results suggest that different mechanisms of action exist at the
      secretome level for low and high doses of ionizing radiation.

TI  - Whole Genome Analyses of a Well-Differentiated Liposarcoma Reveals Novel SYT1 and
      DDR2 Rearrangements.
LID - e87113
AB  - Liposarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma, but little is known about the
      genomic basis of this disease. Given the low cell content of this tumor type, we 
      utilized flow cytometry to isolate the diploid normal and aneuploid tumor
      populations from a well-differentiated liposarcoma prior to array comparative
      genomic hybridization and whole genome sequencing. This work revealed massive
      highly focal amplifications throughout the aneuploid tumor genome including MDM2,
      a gene that has previously been found to be amplified in well-differentiated
      liposarcoma. Structural analysis revealed massive rearrangement of chromosome 12 
      and 11 gene fusions, some of which may be part of double minute chromosomes
      commonly present in well-differentiated liposarcoma. We identified a hotspot of
      genomic instability localized to a region of chromosome 12 that includes a highly
      conserved, putative L1 retrotransposon element, LOC100507498 which resides within
      a gene cluster (NAV3, SYT1, PAWR) where 6 of the 11 fusion events occurred.
      Interestingly, a potential gene fusion was also identified in amplified DDR2,
      which is a potential therapeutic target of kinase inhibitors such as dastinib,
      that are not routinely used in the treatment of patients with liposarcoma.
      Furthermore, 7 somatic, damaging single nucleotide variants have also been
      identified, including D125N in the PTPRQ protein. In conclusion, this work is the
      first to report the entire genome of a well-differentiated liposarcoma with novel
      chromosomal rearrangements associated with amplification of therapeutically
      targetable genes such as MDM2 and DDR2.

TI  - Proteome Analysis for Downstream Targets of Oncogenic KRAS - the Potential
      Participation of CLIC4 in Carcinogenesis in the Lung.
LID - e87193
AB  - This study investigated the proteome modulated by oncogenic KRAS in immortalized 
      airway epithelial cells. Chloride intracellular channel protein 4 (CLIC4), S100
      proteins (S100A2 and S100A11), tropomyosin 2, cathepsin L1, integrinsα3,
      eukaryotic elongation factor 1, vimentin, and others were discriminated. We here 
      focused on CLIC4 to investigate its potential involvement in carcinogenesis in
      the lung because previous studies suggested that some chloride channels and
      chloride channel regulators could function as tumor suppressors. CILC4 protein
      levels were reduced in some lung cancer cell lines. The restoration of CLIC4 in
      lung cancer cell lines in which CLIC4 expression was reduced attenuated their
      growth activity. The immunohistochemical expression of the CLIC4 protein was
      weaker in primary lung cancer cells than in non-tumorous airway epithelial cells 
      and was occasionally undetectable in some tumors. CLIC4 protein levels were
      significantly lower in a subtype of mucinous ADC than in others, and were also
      significantly lower in KRAS-mutated ADC than in EGFR-mutated ADC. These results
      suggest that the alteration in CLIC4 could be involved in restrictedly the
      development of a specific fraction of lung adenocarcinomas. The potential benefit
      of the proteome modulated by oncogenic KRAS to lung cancer research has been
      demonstrated.

TI  - Phosphocaveolin-1 Enforces Tumor Growth and Chemoresistance in Rhabdomyosarcoma.
LID - e84618
AB  - Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) can ambiguously behave as either tumor suppressor or oncogene 
      depending on its phosphorylation state and the type of cancer. In this study we
      show that Cav-1 was phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 (pCav-1) by Src-kinase family
      members in various human cell lines and primary mouse cultures of
      rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most frequent soft-tissue sarcoma affecting
      childhood. Cav-1 overexpression in the human embryonal RD or alveolar RH30 cells 
      yielded increased pCav-1 levels and reinforced the phosphorylation state of
      either ERK or AKT kinase, respectively, in turn enhancing in vitro cell
      proliferation, migration, invasiveness and chemoresistance. In contrast, reducing
      the pCav-1 levels by administration of a Src-kinase inhibitor or through targeted
      Cav-1 silencing counteracted the malignant in vitro phenotype of RMS cells.
      Consistent with these results, xenotransplantation of Cav-1 overexpressing RD
      cells into nude mice resulted in substantial tumor growth in comparison to
      control cells. Taken together, these data point to pCav-1 as an important and
      therapeutically valuable target for overcoming the progression and multidrug
      resistance of RMS.

TI  - Phosphoproteomics and Bioinformatics Analyses of Spinal Cord Proteins in Rats
      with Morphine Tolerance.
LID - e83817
AB  - Introduction: Morphine is the most effective pain-relieving drug, but it can
      cause unwanted side effects. Direct neuraxial administration of morphine to
      spinal cord not only can provide effective, reliable pain relief but also can
      prevent the development of supraspinal side effects. However, repeated neuraxial 
      administration of morphine may still lead to morphine tolerance. Methods: To
      better understand the mechanism that causes morphine tolerance, we induced
      tolerance in rats at the spinal cord level by giving them twice-daily injections 
      of morphine (20 µg/10 µL) for 4 days. We confirmed tolerance by measuring paw
      withdrawal latencies and maximal possible analgesic effect of morphine on day 5. 
      We then carried out phosphoproteomic analysis to investigate the global
      phosphorylation of spinal proteins associated with morphine tolerance. Finally,
      pull-down assays were used to identify phosphorylated types and sites of 14-3-3
      proteins, and bioinformatics was applied to predict biological networks impacted 
      by the morphine-regulated proteins. Results: Our proteomics data showed that
      repeated morphine treatment altered phosphorylation of 10 proteins in the spinal 
      cord. Pull-down assays identified 2 serine/threonine phosphorylated sites in
      14-3-3 proteins. Bioinformatics further revealed that morphine impacted on
      cytoskeletal reorganization, neuroplasticity, protein folding and modulation,
      signal transduction and biomolecular metabolism. Conclusions: Repeated morphine
      administration may affect multiple biological networks by altering protein
      phosphorylation. These data may provide insight into the mechanism that underlies
      the development of morphine tolerance.

TI  - Endogenous Carbamylation of Renal Medullary Proteins.
LID - e82655
AB  - Protein carbamylation is a post-translational modification that can occur in the 
      presence of urea. In solution, urea is in equilibrium with ammonium cyanate, and 
      carbamylation occurs when cyanate ions react with the amino groups of lysines,
      arginines, protein N-termini, as well as sulfhydryl groups of cysteines. The
      concentration of urea is elevated in the renal inner medulla compared with other 
      tissues. Due to the high urea concentration, we hypothesized that carbamylation
      can occur endogenously within the rat inner medulla. Using immunoblotting of rat 
      kidney cortical and medullary homogenates with a carbamyl-lysine specific
      antibody, we showed that carbamylation is present in a large number of inner
      medullary proteins. Using protein mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of rat renal inner
      medulla, we identified 456 unique carbamylated sites in 403 proteins, including
      many that play important physiological roles in the renal medulla [Data can be
      accessed at
      https://helixweb.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/Carbamylation/Carbamylation_peptide_sorted
      .html]. We conclude that protein carbamylation occurs endogenously in the kidney,
      modifying many physiologically important proteins.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Analysis Identifies Activation of the RET and
      IGF-1R/IR Signaling Pathways in Neuroblastoma.
LID - e82513
AB  - Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor of childhood with a heterogenous clinical
      presentation that reflects differences in activation of complex biological
      signaling pathways. Protein phosphorylation is a key component of cellular signal
      transduction and plays a critical role in processes that control cancer cell
      growth and survival. We used shotgun LC/MS to compare phosphorylation between a
      human MYCN amplified neuroblastoma cell line (NB10), modeling a resistant tumor, 
      and a human neural precursor cell line (NPC), modeling a normal baseline neural
      crest cell. 2181 unique phosphorylation sites representing 1171 proteins and 2598
      phosphopeptides were found. Protein kinases accounted for 6% of the proteome,
      with a predominance of tyrosine kinases, supporting their prominent role in
      oncogenic signaling pathways. Highly abundant receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
      phosphopeptides in the NB10 cell line relative to the NPC cell line included RET,
      insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor/insulin receptor (IGF-1R/IR), and
      fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). Multiple phosphorylated peptides
      from downstream mediators of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS pathways were also highly 
      abundant in NB10 relative to NPC. Our analysis highlights the importance of RET, 
      IGF-1R/IR and FGFR1 as RTKs in neuroblastoma and suggests a methodology that can 
      be used to identify potential novel biological therapeutic targets. Furthermore, 
      application of this previously unexploited technology in the clinic opens the
      possibility of providing a new wide-scale molecular signature to assess disease
      progression and prognosis.

TI  - HDAC4 Does Not Act as a Protein Deacetylase in the Postnatal Murine Brain In
      Vivo.
LID - e80849
AB  - Reversible protein acetylation provides a central mechanism for controlling gene 
      expression and cellular signaling events. It is governed by the antagonistic
      commitment of two enzymes families: the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the
      histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDAC4, like its class IIa counterparts, is a potent
      transcriptional repressor through interactions with tissue specific transcription
      factors via its N-terminal domain. Whilst the lysine deacetylase activity of the 
      class IIa HDACs is much less potent than that of the class I enzymes, HDAC4 has
      been reported to influence protein deacetylation through its interaction with
      HDAC3. To investigate the influence of HDAC4 on protein acetylation we employed
      the immunoaffinity-based AcetylScan proteomic method. We identified many proteins
      known to be modified by acetylation, but found that the absence of HDAC4 had no
      effect on the acetylation profile of the murine neonate brain. This is consistent
      with the biochemical data suggesting that HDAC4 may not function as a lysine
      deacetylase, but these in vivo data do not support the previous report showing
      that the enzymatic activity of HDAC3 might be modified by its interaction with
      HDAC4. To complement this work, we used Affymetrix arrays to investigate the
      effect of HDAC4 knock-out on the transcriptional profile of the postnatal murine 
      brain. There was no effect on global transcription, consistent with the absence
      of a differential histone acetylation profile. Validation of the array data by
      Taq-man qPCR indicated that only protamine 1 and Igfbp6 mRNA levels were
      increased by more than one-fold and only Calml4 was decreased. The lack of a
      major effect on the transcriptional profile is consistent with the cytoplasmic
      location of HDAC4 in the P3 murine brain.

      Plasma Membrane between Normal and Preeclampsia Pregnancies with High-Resolution 
      Mass Spectrometry.
LID - e80480
AB  - Preeclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy, which affects 2–8% of all
      pregnancies and is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality 
      and morbidity worldwide. To better understand the molecular mechanisms involved
      in pathological development of placenta in preeclampsia, we used high-resolution 
      LC-MS/MS technologies to construct a comparative N-glycoproteomic and
      phosphoproteomic profiling of human placental plasma membrane in normal and
      preeclamptic pregnancies. A total of 1027 N-glyco- and 2094 phospho- sites were
      detected in human placental plasma membrane, and 5 N-glyco- and 38 phospho-
      proteins, respectively, with differentially expression were definitively
      identified between control and preeclamptic placental plasma membrane. Further
      bioinformatics analysis indicated that these differentially expressed proteins
      correlate with several specific cellular processes occurring during pathological 
      changes of preeclamptic placental plasma membrane.

TI  - Global Phosphotyrosine Proteomics Identifies PKCδ as a Marker of Responsiveness
      to Src Inhibition in Colorectal Cancer.
LID - e80207
AB  - Sensitive and specific biomarkers of protein kinase inhibition can be leveraged
      to accelerate drug development studies in oncology by associating early molecular
      responses with target inhibition. In this study, we utilized unbiased shotgun
      phosphotyrosine (pY) proteomics to discover novel biomarkers of response to
      dasatinib, a small molecule Src-selective inhibitor, in preclinical models of
      colorectal cancer (CRC). We performed unbiased mass spectrometry shotgun pY
      proteomics to reveal the pY proteome of cultured HCT-116 colonic carcinoma cells,
      and then extended this analysis to HCT-116 xenograft tumors to identify pY
      biomarkers of dasatinib-responsiveness in vivo. Major dasatinib-responsive pY
      sites in xenograft tumors included sites on delta-type protein kinase C (PKCδ),
      CUB-domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1), Type-II SH2-domain-containing inositol
      5-phosphatase (SHIP2), and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (RPTPα).
      The pY313 site PKCδ was further supported as a relevant biomarker of
      dasatinib-mediated Src inhibition in HCT-116 xenografts by immunohistochemistry
      and immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antibody. Reduction of PKCδ pY313 was
      further correlated with dasatinib-mediated inhibition of Src and diminished
      growth as spheroids of a panel of human CRC cell lines. These studies reveal PKCδ
      pY313 as a promising readout of Src inhibition in CRC and potentially other solid
      tumors and may reflect responsiveness to dasatinib in a subset of colorectal
      cancers.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteome Analysis Unveils LAT as a Modulator of CD3ζ and
      ZAP-70 Tyrosine Phosphorylation.
LID - e77423
AB  - Signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR) initiates adaptive immunity and its
      perturbation may results in autoimmunity. The plasma membrane scaffolding protein
      LAT acts as a central organizer of the TCR signaling machinery to activate many
      functional pathways. LAT-deficient mice develop an autoimmune syndrome but the
      mechanism of this pathology is unknown. In this work we have compared global
      dynamics of TCR signaling by MS-based quantitative phosphoproteomics in
      LAT-sufficient and LAT-defective Jurkat T cells. Surprisingly, we found that many
      TCR-induced phosphorylation events persist in the absence of LAT, despite ERK and
      PLCγ1 phosphorylation being repressed. Most importantly, the absence of LAT
      resulted in augmented and persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3ζ and ZAP70. 
      This indicates that LAT signaling hub is also implicated in negative feedback
      signals to modulate upstream phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation kinetics
      data resulting from this investigation is documented in a database (phosphoTCR)
      accessible online. The MS data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with
      identifier PXD000341.

TI  - Effect of IRS4 Levels on PI 3-Kinase Signalling.
LID - e73327
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2 are well-characterized adapter
      proteins that relay signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to downstream
      components of signalling pathways. In contrast, the function of IRS4 is not well 
      understood. IRS4 overexpression has been associated with acute lymphoblastic
      leukaemia and subungual exostosis, while point mutations of IRS4 have been found 
      in melanomas. Here, we show that while IRS4 expression is low in most cancer cell
      lines, IRS4 mRNA and protein levels are markedly elevated in certain cells
      including the NCI-H720, DMS114, HEK293T and HEK293AAV lines. Surprisingly, IRS4
      expression was also strongly induced when HEK293 cells were infected with
      retroviral particles and selected under puromycin, making IRS4 expression a
      potential off-target effect of retroviral expression vectors. Cells with high
      expression of IRS4 displayed high phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
      (PIP3) levels, as well as elevated Akt and p70 S6 kinase activities, even in the 
      absence of growth factors. PI 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling in these cells depends
      on IRS4, even though these cells also express IRS1/2. Knockdown of IRS4 also
      inhibited cell proliferation in cells with high levels of IRS4. Together, these
      findings suggest IRS4 as a potential therapeutic target for cancers with high
      expression of this protein.

TI  - Cell Cycle Regulated Phosphorylation of the Telomere-Associated Protein TIN2.
LID - e71697
AB  - The protein TIN2 is a member of telomere-binding protein complex that serves to
      cap and protect mammalian chromosome ends. As a number of proteins in this
      complex are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, we investigated
      whether TIN2 is modified by phosphorylation as well. We performed
      phospho-proteomic analysis of human TIN2, and identified two phosphorylated
      residues, serines 295 and 330. We demonstrated that both these sites were
      phosphorylated during mitosis in human cells, as detected by Phos-tag reagent and
      phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Phosphorylation of serines 295 and 330
      appeared to be mediated, at least in part, by the mitotic kinase RSK2.
      Specifically, phosphorylation of TIN2 at both these residues was increased upon
      expression of RSK2 and reduced by an inhibitor of the RSK family of kinases.
      Moreover, RSK2 phosphorylated TIN2 in vitro. The identification of these
      specifically timed post-translational events during the cell cycle suggests a
      potential mitotic regulation of TIN2 by phosphorylation.

TI  - Exosomal Signaling during Hypoxia Mediates Microvascular Endothelial Cell
      Migration and Vasculogenesis.
LID - e68451
AB  - Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are critical processes in fetal circulation and
      placental vasculature development. Placental mesenchymal stem cells (pMSC) are
      known to release paracrine factors (some of which are contained within exosomes) 
      that promote angiogenesis and cell migration. The aims of this study were: to
      determine the effects of oxygen tension on the release of exosomes from pMSC; and
      to establish the effects of pMSC-derived exosomes on the migration and angiogenic
      tube formation of placental microvascular endothelial cells (hPMEC). pMSC were
      isolated from placental villi (8–12 weeks of gestation, n = 6) and cultured under
      an atmosphere of 1%, 3% or 8% O2. Cell-conditioned media were collected and
      exosomes (exo-pMSC) isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation. 
      The dose effect (5–20 µg exosomal protein/ml) of pMSC-derived exosomes on hPMEC
      migration and tube formation were established using a real-time, live-cell
      imaging system (Incucyte™). The exosome pellet was resuspended in PBS and protein
      content was established by mass spectrometry (MS). Protein function and canonical
      pathways were identified using the PANTHER program and Ingenuity Pathway
      Analysis, respectively. Exo-pMSC were identified, by electron microscopy, as
      spherical vesicles, with a typical cup-shape and diameters around of 100 nm and
      positive for exosome markers: CD63, CD9 and CD81. Under hypoxic conditions (1%
      and 3% O2) exo-pMSC released increased by 3.3 and 6.7 folds, respectively, when
      compared to the controls (8% O2; p<0.01). Exo-pMSC increased hPMEC migration by
      1.6 fold compared to the control (p<0.05) and increased hPMEC tube formation by
      7.2 fold (p<0.05). MS analysis identified 390 different proteins involved in
      cytoskeleton organization, development, immunomodulatory, and cell-to-cell
      communication. The data obtained support the hypothesis that pMSC-derived
      exosomes may contribute to placental vascular adaptation to low oxygen tension
      under both physiological and pathological conditions.

TI  - Application of Multiplexed Kinase Inhibitor Beads to Study Kinome Adaptations in 
      Drug-Resistant Leukemia.
LID - e66755
AB  - Protein kinases play key roles in oncogenic signaling and are a major focus in
      the development of targeted cancer therapies. Imatinib, a BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor, is a successful front-line treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia 
      (CML). However, resistance to imatinib may be acquired by BCR-Abl mutations or
      hyperactivation of Src family kinases such as Lyn. We have used multiplexed
      kinase inhibitor beads (MIBs) and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to compare 
      kinase expression and activity in an imatinib-resistant (MYL-R) and -sensitive
      (MYL) cell model of CML. Using MIB/MS, expression and activity changes of over
      150 kinases were quantitatively measured from various protein kinase families.
      Statistical analysis of experimental replicates assigned significance to 35 of
      these kinases, referred to as the MYL-R kinome profile. MIB/MS and immunoblotting
      confirmed the over-expression and activation of Lyn in MYL-R cells and identified
      additional kinases with increased (MEK, ERK, IKKα, PKCβ, NEK9) or decreased (Abl,
      Kit, JNK, ATM, Yes) abundance or activity. Inhibiting Lyn with dasatinib or by
      shRNA-mediated knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of MEK and IKKα. Because
      MYL-R cells showed elevated NF-κB signaling relative to MYL cells, as
      demonstrated by increased IκBα and IL-6 mRNA expression, we tested the effects of
      an IKK inhibitor (BAY 65-1942). MIB/MS and immunoblotting revealed that BAY
      65-1942 increased MEK/ERK signaling and that this increase was prevented by
      co-treatment with a MEK inhibitor (AZD6244). Furthermore, the combined inhibition
      of MEK and IKKα resulted in reduced IL-6 mRNA expression, synergistic loss of
      cell viability and increased apoptosis. Thus, MIB/MS analysis identified MEK and 
      IKKα as important downstream targets of Lyn, suggesting that co-targeting these
      kinases may provide a unique strategy to inhibit Lyn-dependent imatinib-resistant
      CML. These results demonstrate the utility of MIB/MS as a tool to identify
      dysregulated kinases and to interrogate kinome dynamics as cells respond to
      targeted kinase inhibition.

TI  - Computational Model of Gab1/2-Dependent VEGFR2 Pathway to Akt Activation.
LID - e67438
AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signal transduction is central to
      angiogenesis in development and in pathological conditions such as cancer,
      retinopathy and ischemic diseases. However, no detailed mass-action models of
      VEGF receptor signaling have been developed. We constructed and validated the
      first computational model of VEGFR2 trafficking and signaling, to study the
      opposing roles of Gab1 and Gab2 in regulation of Akt phosphorylation in
      VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells. Trafficking parameters were optimized against 
      5 previously published in vitro experiments, and the model was validated against 
      six independent published datasets. The model showed agreement at several key
      nodes, involving scaffolding proteins Gab1, Gab2 and their complexes with Shp2.
      VEGFR2 recruitment of Gab1 is greater in magnitude, slower, and more sustained
      than that of Gab2. As Gab2 binds VEGFR2 complexes more transiently than Gab1,
      VEGFR2 complexes can recycle and continue to participate in other signaling
      pathways. Correspondingly, the simulation results show a log-linear relationship 
      between a decrease in Akt phosphorylation and Gab1 knockdown while a linear
      relationship was observed between an increase in Akt phosphorylation and Gab2
      knockdown. Global sensitivity analysis demonstrated the importance of
      initial-concentration ratios of antagonistic molecular species (Gab1/Gab2 and
      PI3K/Shp2) in determining Akt phosphorylation profiles. It also showed that
      kinetic parameters responsible for transient Gab2 binding affect the system at
      specific nodes. This model can be expanded to study multiple signaling contexts
      and receptor crosstalk and can form a basis for investigation of therapeutic
      approaches, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), overexpression of key
      signaling proteins or knockdown experiments.

TI  - A Role of TGFß1 Dependent 14-3-3σ Phosphorylation at Ser69 and Ser74 in the
      Regulation of Gene Transcription, Stemness and Radioresistance.
LID - e65163
AB  - Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is a potent regulator of tumorigenesis,
      although mechanisms defining its tumor suppressing and tumor promoting activities
      are not understood. Here we describe phosphoproteome profiling of TGFβ signaling 
      in mammary epithelial cells, and show that 60 identified TGFβ-regulated
      phosphoproteins form a network with scale-free characteristics. The network
      highlighted interactions, which may distribute signaling inputs to regulation of 
      cell proliferation, metabolism, differentiation and cell organization. In this
      report, we identified two novel and TGFβ-dependent phosphorylation sites of
      14-3-3σ, i.e. Ser69 and Ser74. We observed that 14-3-3σ phosphorylation is a
      feed-forward mechanism in TGFβ/Smad3-dependent transcription. TGFβ-dependent
      14-3-3σ phosphorylation may provide a scaffold for the formation of the protein
      complexes which include Smad3 and p53 at the Smad3-specific CAGA element.
      Furthermore, breast tumor xenograft studies in mice and radiobiological assays
      showed that phosphorylation of 14-3-3σ at Ser69 and Ser74 is involved in
      regulation of cancer progenitor population and radioresistance in breast cancer
      MCF7 cells. Our data suggest that TGFβ-dependent phosphorylation of 14-3-3σ
      orchestrates a functional interaction of TGFβ/Smad3 with p53, plays a role in the
      maintenance of cancer stem cells and could provide a new potential target for
      intervention in breast cancer.

TI  - Involvement of Phosphorylation of Adenosine 5′-Monophosphate-Activated Protein
      Kinase in PTTH-Stimulated Ecdysteroidogenesis in Prothoracic Glands of the
      Silkworm, Bombyx mori.
LID - e63102
AB  - In this study, we investigated inhibition of the phosphorylation of adenosine
      5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by prothoracicotropic hormone
      (PTTH) in prothoracic glands of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. We found that
      treatment with PTTH in vitro inhibited AMPK phosphorylation in time- and
      dose-dependent manners, as seen on Western blots of glandular lysates probed with
      antibody directed against AMPKα phosphorylated at Thr172. Moreover, in vitro
      inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation by PTTH was also verified by in vivo
      experiments: injection of PTTH into day 7 last instar larvae greatly inhibited
      glandular AMPK phosphorylation. PTTH-inhibited AMPK phosphorylation appeared to
      be partially reversed by treatment with LY294002, indicating involvement of
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. A chemical activator of AMPK
      (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside, AICAR) increased both basal
      and PTTH-inhibited AMPK phosphorylation. Treatment with AICAR also inhibited
      PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroidogenesis of prothoracic glands. The mechanism
      underlying inhibition of PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroidogenesis by AICAR was further
      investigated by determining the phosphorylation of eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) 
      and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), two known downstream signaling targets
      of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). Upon treatment with AICAR,
      decreases in PTTH-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP and S6K were detected. In
      addition, treatment with AICAR did not affect PTTH-stimulated extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, indicating that AMPK
      phosphorylation is not upstream signaling for ERK phosphorylation. Examination of
      gene expression levels of AMPKα, β, and γ by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
      showed that PTTH did not affect AMPK transcription. From these results, it is
      assumed that inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation, which lies upstream of
      PTTH-stimulated TOR signaling, may play a role in PTTH stimulation of
      ecdysteroidogenesis.

TI  - Novel Binding Partners and Differentially Regulated Phosphorylation Sites Clarify
      Eps8 as a Multi-Functional Adaptor.
LID - e61513
AB  - Eps8 is involved in both cell signalling and receptor trafficking. It is a known 
      phosphorylation substrate for two proteins involved in the fibroblast growth
      factor receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway: the receptor itself and Src. Here we
      report a differential proteomic analysis of Eps8 aimed to identify specific FGFR 
      and Src family kinase dependent phosphosites and co-associated phosphodependent
      binding partners. This study reveals a total of 22 Eps8 pTyr and pSer/Thr
      phosphorylation sites, including those that are dependent on Src family and FGFR 
      kinase activity. Peptide affinity purification of proteins that bind to a
      selection of the pTyr phosphosites has identified a range of novel Eps8 binding
      partners including members of the intracellular vesicle trafficking machinery
      (clathrin and AP-2), proteins which have been shown to regulate activated
      receptor trafficking (NBR1 and Vav2), and proteins involved in receptor
      signalling (IRS4 and Shp2). Collectively this study significantly extends the
      understanding of Eps8 post-translational modification by regulated
      phosphorylation, identifies novel Eps8 binding partners implicated in receptor
      trafficking and signalling, and confirms the functions of Eps8 at the nexus of
      receptor signalling and vesicular trafficking.

TI  - Phosphorylation of mRNA Decapping Protein Dcp1a by the ERK Signaling Pathway
      during Early Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes.
LID - e61697
AB  - Background: Turnover of mRNA is a critical step in the regulation of gene
      expression, and an important step in mRNA decay is removal of the 5′ cap. We
      previously demonstrated that the expression of some immediate early gene mRNAs is
      controlled by RNA stability during early differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.
      Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that the mouse decapping protein
      Dcp1a is phosphorylated via the ERK signaling pathway during early
      differentiation of preadipocytes. Mass spectrometry analysis and site-directed
      mutagenesis combined with a kinase assay identified ERK pathway–mediated dual
      phosphorylation at Ser 315 and Ser 319 of Dcp1a. To understand the functional
      effects of Dcp1a phosphorylation, we examined protein-protein interactions
      between Dcp1a and other decapping components with co-immunoprecipitation. Dcp1a
      interacted with Ddx6 and Edc3 through its proline-rich C-terminal extension,
      whereas the conserved EVH1 (enabled vasodilator-stimulated protein homology 1)
      domain in the N terminus of Dcp1a showed a stronger interaction with Dcp2. Once
      ERK signaling was activated, the interaction between Dcp1a and Ddx6, Edc3, or
      Edc4 was not affected by Dcp1a phosphorylation. Phosphorylated Dcp1a did,
      however, enhanced interaction with Dcp2. Protein complexes immunoprecipitated
      with the recombinant phosphomimetic Dcp1a(S315D/S319D) mutant contained more Dcp2
      than did those immunoprecipitated with the nonphosphorylated Dcp1a(S315A/S319A)
      mutant. In addition, Dcp1a associated with AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNAs
      such as MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), whose mRNA stability was analyzed under the
      overexpression of Dcp1a constructs in the Dcp1a knockdown 3T3-L1 cells.
      Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that ERK-phosphorylated Dcp1a
      enhances its interaction with the decapping enzyme Dcp2 during early
      differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells.

TI  - PKG II Inhibits EGF/EGFR-Induced Migration of Gastric Cancer Cells.
LID - e61674
AB  - Background: Our previous research results showed that Type II cGMP dependent
      protein kinase (PKG II) could block the activation of epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) and consequently inhibit the proliferation and the related
      MAPK/ERK-mediated signal transduction of gastric cancer cell line BGC-823,
      suggesting that PKG II might inhibit other EGFR-triggered signal transduction
      pathways and related biological activities of gastric cancer cells. This paper
      was designed to investigate the potential inhibition of PKG II on
      EGF/EGFR-induced migration activity and the related signal transduction pathways.
      Methodology/Principal Findings: In gastric cancer cell line AGS, expression and
      activity of PKG II were increased by infecting the cells with adenoviral
      construct encoding PKG II cDNA (Ad-PKG II) and treating the cells with cGMP
      analogue 8-pCPT-cGMP. Phosphorylation of proteins was detected by Western
      Blotting and active small G protein Ras and Rac1 was measured by “Pull-down”
      method. Cell migration activity was detected with trans-well equipment. Binding
      between PKG II and EGFR was detected with Co-IP. The results showed EGF
      stimulated migration of AGS cell and the effect was related to PLCγ1 and
      ERK-mediated signal transduction pathways. PKG II inhibited EGF-induced migration
      activity and blocked EGF-initiated signal transduction of PLCγ1 and
      MAPK/ERK-mediated pathways through preventing EGF-induced Tyr 992 and Tyr 1068
      phosphorylation of EGFR. PKG II bound with EGFR and caused threonine
      phosphorylation of it. Conclusion/Significance: Our results systemically confirms
      the inhibition of PKG II on EGF-induced migration and related signal transduction
      of PLCγ1 and MAPK/ERK-mediated pathways, indicating that PKG II has a fargoing
      inhibition on EGF/EGFR related signal transduction and biological activities of
      gastric cancer cells through phosphorylating EGFR and blocking the activation of 
      it.

TI  - Global Analysis of Neuronal Phosphoproteome Regulation by Chondroitin Sulfate
      Proteoglycans.
LID - e59285
AB  - Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are major components of the
      extracellular matrix which mediate inhibition of axonal regeneration after injury
      to the central nervous system (CNS). Several neuronal receptors for CSPGs have
      recently been identified; however, the signaling pathways by which CSPGs restrict
      axonal growth are still largely unknown. In this study, we applied quantitative
      phosphoproteomics to investigate the global changes in protein phosphorylation
      induced by CSPGs in primary neurons. In combination with isobaric Tags for
      Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling, strong cation exchange
      chromatography (SCX) fractionation, immobilized metal affinity chromatography
      (IMAC) and LC-MS/MS, we identified and quantified 2214 unique phosphopeptides
      corresponding to 1118 phosphoproteins, with 118 changing significantly in
      abundance with CSPG treatment. The proteins that were regulated by CSPGs included
      key components of synaptic vesicle trafficking, axon guidance mediated by
      semaphorins, integrin signaling, cadherin signaling and EGF receptor signaling
      pathways. A significant number of the regulated proteins are cytoskeletal and
      related proteins that have been implicated in regulating neurite growth. Another 
      highly represented protein category regulated by CSPGs is nucleic acid binding
      proteins involved in RNA post-transcriptional regulation. Together, by screening 
      the overall phosphoproteome changes induced by CSPGs, this data expand our
      understanding of CSPG signaling, which provides new insights into development of 
      strategies for overcoming CSPG inhibition and promoting axonal regeneration after
      CNS injury.

TI  - Mapping of p140Cap Phosphorylation Sites: The EPLYA and EGLYA Motifs Have a Key
      Role in Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Csk Binding, and Are Substrates of the Abl
      Kinase.
LID - e54931
AB  - Protein phosphorylation tightly regulates specific binding of effector proteins
      that control many diverse biological functions of cells (e. g. signaling,
      migration and proliferation). p140Cap is an adaptor protein, specifically
      expressed in brain, testis and epithelial cells, that undergoes phosphorylation
      and tunes its interactions with other regulatory molecules via post-translation
      modification. In this work, using mass spectrometry, we found that p140Cap is in 
      vivo phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) within the peptide GEGLpYADPYGLLHEGR (from
      now on referred to as EGLYA) as well as on three serine residues. Consistently,
      EGLYA has the highest score of in silico prediction of p140Cap phosphorylation.
      To further investigate the p140Cap function, we performed site specific
      mutagenesis on tyrosines inserted in EGLYA and EPLYA, a second sequence with the 
      same highest score of phosphorylation. The mutant protein, in which both
      EPLYA/EGLYA tyrosines were converted to phenylalanine, was no longer tyrosine
      phosphorylated, despite the presence of other tyrosine residues in p140Cap
      sequence. Moreover, this mutant lost its ability to bind the C-terminal Src
      kinase (Csk), previously shown to interact with p140Cap by Far Western analysis. 
      In addition, we found that in vitro and in HEK-293 cells, the Abelson kinase is
      the major kinase involved in p140Cap tyrosine phosphorylation on the EPLYA and
      EGLYA sequences. Overall, these data represent an original attempt to in vivo
      characterise phosphorylated residues of p140Cap. Elucidating the function of
      p140Cap will provide novel insights into its biological activity not only in
      normal cells, but also in tumors.

TI  - A Telomerase Immortalized Human Proximal Tubule Cell Line with a Truncation
      Mutation (Q4004X) in Polycystin-1.
LID - e55191
AB  - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with a variety
      of cellular phenotypes in renal epithelial cells. Cystic epithelia are secretory 
      as opposed to absorptive, have higher proliferation rates in cell culture and
      have some characteristics of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions [1], [2]. In
      this communication we describe a telomerase immortalized cell line that expresses
      proximal tubule markers and is derived from renal cysts of an ADPKD kidney. These
      cells have a single detectable truncating mutation (Q4004X) in polycystin-1.
      These cells make normal appearing but shorter cilia and fail to assemble
      polycystin-1 in the cilia, and less uncleaved polycystin-1 in membrane fractions.
      This cell line has been maintained in continuous passage for over 35 passages
      without going into senescence. Nephron segment specific markers suggest a
      proximal tubule origin for these cells and the cell line will be useful to study 
      mechanistic details of cyst formation in proximal tubule cells.

      Cancer Aggressiveness.
LID - e53328
AB  - To identify aggressiveness-associated molecular mechanisms and biomarker
      candidates in bladder cancer, we performed a SILAC (Stable Isotope Labelling by
      Amino acids in Cell culture) proteomic analysis comparing an invasive T24 and an 
      aggressive metastatic derived T24T bladder cancer cell line. A total of 289
      proteins were identified differentially expressed between these cells with high
      confidence. Complementary and validation analyses included comparison of protein 
      SILAC data with mRNA expression ratios obtained from oligonucleotide microarrays,
      and immunoblotting. Cul3, an overexpressed protein in T24T, involved in the
      ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, was
      selected for further investigation. Functional analyses revealed that Cul3
      silencing diminished proliferative, migration and invasive rates of T24T cells,
      and restored the expression of cytoskeleton proteins identified to be
      underexpressed in T24T cells by SILAC, such as ezrin, moesin, filamin or
      caveolin. Cul3 immunohistochemical protein patterns performed on bladder tumours 
      spotted onto tissue microarrays (n = 284), were associated with tumor staging,
      lymph node metastasis and disease-specific survival. Thus, the SILAC approach
      identified that Cul3 modulated the aggressive phenotype of T24T cells by
      modifying the expression of cytoskeleton proteins involved in bladder cancer
      aggressiveness; and played a biomarker role for bladder cancer progression, nodal
      metastasis and clinical outcome assessment.

TI  - Characterization of the Phosphoproteome in SLE Patients.
LID - e53129
AB  - Protein phosphorylation is a complex regulatory event that is involved in the
      signaling networks that affect virtually every cellular process. The protein
      phosphorylation may be a novel source for discovering biomarkers and drug
      targets. However, a systematic analysis of the phosphoproteome in patients with
      SLE has not been performed. To clarify the pathogenesis of systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE), we compared phosphoprotein expression in PBMCs from SLE
      patients and normal subjects using proteomics analyses. Phosphopeptides were
      enriched using TiO2 from PBMCs isolated from 15 SLE patients and 15 healthy
      subjects and then analyzed by automated LC-MS/MS analysis. Phosphorylation sites 
      were identified and quantitated by MASCOT and MaxQuant. A total of 1035
      phosphorylation sites corresponding to 618 NCBI-annotated genes were identified
      in SLE patients compared with normal subjects. Differentially expressed proteins,
      peptides and phosphorylation sites were then subjected to bioinformatics
      analyses. Gene ontology(GO) and pathway analyses showed that nucleic acid
      metabolism, cellular component organization, transport and multicellular
      organismal development pathways made up the largest proportions of the
      differentially expressed genes. Pathway analyses showed that the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and actin cytoskeleton 
      regulators made up the largest proportions of the metabolic pathways. Network
      analysis showed that rous sarcoma oncogene (SRC), v-rel reticuloendotheliosis
      viral oncogene homolog A (RELA), histone deacetylase (HDA1C) and protein kinase
      C, delta (PRKCD) play important roles in the stability of the network. These data
      suggest that aberrant protein phosphorylation may contribute to SLE pathogenesis.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteomics Reveals SLP-76 Dependent Regulation of PAG and Src
      Family Kinases in T Cells.
LID - e46725
AB  - The SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) plays a critical
      scaffolding role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. As an adaptor protein that
      contains multiple protein-binding domains, SLP-76 interacts with many signaling
      molecules and links proximal receptor stimulation to downstream effectors. The
      function of SLP-76 in TCR signaling has been widely studied using the Jurkat
      human leukaemic T cell line through protein disruption or site-directed
      mutagenesis. However, a wide-scale characterization of SLP-76-dependant
      phosphorylation events is still lacking. Quantitative profiling of over a hundred
      tyrosine phosphorylation sites revealed new modes of regulation of
      phosphorylation of PAG, PI3K, and WASP while reconfirming previously established 
      regulation of Itk, PLCγ, and Erk phosphorylation by SLP-76. The absence of SLP-76
      also perturbed the phosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFKs) Lck and Fyn, and 
      subsequently a large number of SFK-regulated signaling molecules. Altogether our 
      data suggests unique modes of regulation of positive and negative feedback
      pathways in T cells by SLP-76, reconfirming its central role in the pathway.

TI  - The Weak Complex between RhoGAP Protein ARHGAP22 and Signal Regulatory Protein
      14-3-3 Has 1∶2 Stoichiometry and a Single Peptide Binding Mode.
LID - e41731
AB  - ARHGAP22 is a RhoGAP protein comprising an N-terminal PH domain, a RhoGAP domain 
      and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. It has recently been identified as an Akt
      substrate that binds 14-3-3 proteins in response to treatment with growth factors
      involved in cell migration. We used a range of biophysical techniques to
      investigate the weak interaction between 14-3-3 and a truncated form of ARHGAP22 
      lacking the coiled-coil domain. This weak interaction could be stabilized by
      chemical cross-linking which we used to show that: a monomer of ARHGAP22 binds a 
      dimer of 14-3-3; the ARHGAP22 PH domain is required for the 14-3-3 interaction;
      the RhoGAP domain is unlikely to participate in the interaction; Ser16 is the
      more important of two predicted 14-3-3 binding sites; and, phosphorylation of
      Ser16 may not be necessary for 14-3-3 interaction under the conditions we used.
      Small angle X-ray scattering and cross-link information were used to generate
      solution structures of the isolated proteins and of the cross-linked
      ARHGAP22:14-3-3 complex, showing that no major rearrangement occurs in either
      protein upon binding, and supporting a role for the PH domain and N-terminal
      peptide of ARHGAP22 in the 14-3-3 interaction. Small-angle X-ray scattering
      measurements of mixtures of ARHGAP22 and 14-3-3 were used to establish that the
      affinity of the interaction is ∼30 µM.

TI  - Mathematical Modelling of the MAP Kinase Pathway Using Proteomic Datasets.
LID - e42230
AB  - The advances in proteomics technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity and
      valuable resources to understand how living organisms execute necessary functions
      at systems levels. However, little work has been done up to date to utilize the
      highly accurate spatio-temporal dynamic proteome data generated by
      phosphoprotemics for mathematical modeling of complex cell signaling pathways.
      This work proposed a novel computational framework to develop mathematical models
      based on proteomic datasets. Using the MAP kinase pathway as the test system, we 
      developed a mathematical model including the cytosolic and nuclear subsystems;
      and applied the genetic algorithm to infer unknown model parameters. Robustness
      property of the mathematical model was used as a criterion to select the
      appropriate rate constants from the estimated candidates. Quantitative
      information regarding the absolute protein concentrations was used to refine the 
      mathematical model. We have demonstrated that the incorporation of more
      experimental data could significantly enhance both the simulation accuracy and
      robustness property of the proposed model. In addition, we used the MAP kinase
      pathway inhibited by phosphatases with different concentrations to predict the
      signal output influenced by different cellular conditions. Our predictions are in
      good agreement with the experimental observations when the MAP kinase pathway was
      inhibited by phosphatase PP2A and MKP3. The successful application of the
      proposed modeling framework to the MAP kinase pathway suggests that our method is
      very promising for developing accurate mathematical models and yielding insights 
      into the regulatory mechanisms of complex cell signaling pathways.

TI  - First Insight into the Kinome of Human Regulatory T Cells.
LID - e40896
AB  - Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for controlling peripheral tolerance by 
      the active suppression of various immune cells including conventional T effector 
      cells (Teffs). Downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR), more than 500 protein
      kinases encoded by the human genome have to be considered in signaling cascades
      regulating the activation of Tregs and Teffs, respectively. Following TCR
      engagement, Tregs posses a number of unique attributes, such as constitutive
      expression of Foxp3, hyporesponsiveness and poor cytokine production.
      Furthermore, recent studies showed that altered regulation of protein kinases is 
      important for Treg function. These data indicate that signaling pathways in Tregs
      are distinctly organized and alterations at the level of protein kinases
      contribute to the unique Treg phenotype. However, kinase-based signaling networks
      in Tregs are poorly understood and necessitate further systematic
      characterization. In this study, we analyzed the differential expression of
      kinases in Tregs and Teffs by using a kinase-selective proteome strategy. In
      total, we revealed quantitative information on 185 kinases expressed in the human
      CD4+ T cell subsets. The majority of kinases was equally abundant in both T cell 
      subsets, but 11 kinases were differentially expressed in Tregs. Most strikingly, 
      Tregs showed an altered expression of cell cycle kinases including CDK6.
      Quantitative proteomics generates first comparative insight into the kinase
      complements of the CD4+ Teff and Treg subset. Treg-specific expression pattern of
      11 protein kinases substantiate the current opinion that TCR-mediated signaling
      cascades are altered in Tregs and further suggests that Tregs exhibit significant
      specificities in cell-cycle control and progression.

TI  - Identifying Biological Network Structure, Predicting Network Behavior, and
      Classifying Network State With High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR).
LID - e37664
AB  - This work presents an adapted Random Sampling - High Dimensional Model
      Representation (RS-HDMR) algorithm for synergistically addressing three key
      problems in network biology: (1) identifying the structure of biological networks
      from multivariate data, (2) predicting network response under previously
      unsampled conditions, and (3) inferring experimental perturbations based on the
      observed network state. RS-HDMR is a multivariate regression method that
      decomposes network interactions into a hierarchy of non-linear component
      functions. Sensitivity analysis based on these functions provides a clear
      physical and statistical interpretation of the underlying network structure. The 
      advantages of RS-HDMR include efficient extraction of nonlinear and cooperative
      network relationships without resorting to discretization, prediction of network 
      behavior without mechanistic modeling, robustness to data noise, and favorable
      scalability of the sampling requirement with respect to network size. As a
      proof-of-principle study, RS-HDMR was applied to experimental data measuring the 
      single-cell response of a protein-protein signaling network to various
      experimental perturbations. A comparison to network structure identified in the
      literature and through other inference methods, including Bayesian and
      mutual-information based algorithms, suggests that RS-HDMR can successfully
      reveal a network structure with a low false positive rate while still capturing
      non-linear and cooperative interactions. RS-HDMR identified several higher-order 
      network interactions that correspond to known feedback regulations among multiple
      network species and that were unidentified by other network inference methods.
      Furthermore, RS-HDMR has a better ability to predict network response under
      unsampled conditions in this application than the best statistical inference
      algorithm presented in the recent DREAM3 signaling-prediction competition.
      RS-HDMR can discern and predict differences in network state that arise from
      sources ranging from intrinsic cell-cell variability to altered experimental
      conditions, such as when drug perturbations are introduced. This ability
      ultimately allows RS-HDMR to accurately classify the experimental conditions of a
      given sample based on its observed network state.

TI  - The IkappaB Kinase Family Phosphorylates the Parkinson’s Disease Kinase LRRK2 at 
      Ser935 and Ser910 during Toll-Like Receptor Signaling.
LID - e39132
AB  - Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are strongly associated with
      late-onset autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 is highly expressed in
      immune cells and recent work points towards a link between LRRK2 and innate
      immunity. Here we demonstrate that stimulation of the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)
      pathway by MyD88-dependent agonists in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or
      RAW264.7 macrophages induces marked phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser910 and
      Ser935, the phosphorylation sites that regulate the binding of 14-3-3 to LRRK2.
      Phosphorylation of these residues is prevented by knock-out of MyD88 in BMDMs,
      but not the alternative TLR adaptor protein TRIF. Utilising both pharmacological 
      inhibitors, including a new TAK1 inhibitor, NG25, and genetic models, we provide 
      evidence that both the canonical (IKKα and IKKβ) and IKK-related (IKKε and TBK1) 
      kinases mediate TLR agonist induced phosphorylation of LRRK2 in vivo. Moreover,
      all four IKK members directly phosphorylate LRRK2 at Ser910 and Ser935 in vitro. 
      Consistent with previous work describing Ser910 and Ser935 as pharmacodynamic
      biomarkers of LRRK2 activity, we find that the TLR independent basal
      phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser910 and Ser935 is abolished following treatment of
      macrophages with LRRK2 kinase inhibitors. However, the increased phosphorylation 
      of Ser910 and Ser935 induced by activation of the MyD88 pathway is insensitive to
      LRRK2 kinase inhibitors. Finally, employing LRRK2-deficient BMDMs, we present
      data indicating that LRRK2 does not play a major role in regulating the secretion
      of inflammatory cytokines induced by activation of the MyD88 pathway. Our
      findings provide the first direct link between LRRK2 and the IKKs that mediate
      many immune responses. Further work is required to uncover the physiological
      roles that phosphorylation of LRRK2 by IKKs play in controlling macrophage
      biology and to determine how phosphorylation of LRRK2 by IKKs impacts upon the
      use of Ser910 and Ser935 as pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

TI  - Increased Urinary Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 in Renal Transplant Patients
      with Diabetes.
LID - e37649
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expressed in the kidney and may be a
      renoprotective enzyme, since it converts angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7). ACE2 
      has been detected in urine from patients with chronic kidney disease. We measured
      urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels in renal transplant patients (age 54
      yrs, 65% male, 38% diabetes, n = 100) and healthy controls (age 45 yrs, 26% male,
      n = 50), and determined factors associated with elevated urinary ACE2 in the
      patients. Urine from transplant subjects was also assayed for ACE mRNA and
      protein. No subjects were taking inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system.
      Urinary ACE2 levels were significantly higher in transplant patients compared to 
      controls (p = 0.003 for ACE2 activity, and p≤0.001 for ACE2 protein by ELISA or
      western analysis). Transplant patients with diabetes mellitus had significantly
      increased urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels compared to non-diabetics
      (p<0.001), while ACE2 mRNA levels did not differ. Urinary ACE activity and
      protein were significantly increased in diabetic transplant subjects, while ACE
      mRNA levels did not differ from non-diabetic subjects. After adjusting for
      confounding variables, diabetes was significantly associated with urinary ACE2
      activity (p = 0.003) and protein levels (p<0.001), while female gender was
      associated with urinary mRNA levels for both ACE2 and ACE. These data indicate
      that urinary ACE2 is increased in renal transplant recipients with diabetes,
      possibly due to increased shedding from tubular cells. Urinary ACE2 could be a
      marker of renal renin-angiotensin system activation in these patients.

TI  - A Novel Classification of Lung Cancer into Molecular Subtypes.
LID - e31906
AB  - The remarkably heterogeneous nature of lung cancer has become more apparent over 
      the last decade. In general, advanced lung cancer is an aggressive malignancy
      with a poor prognosis. The discovery of multiple molecular mechanisms underlying 
      the development, progression, and prognosis of lung cancer, however, has created 
      new opportunities for targeted therapy and improved outcome. In this paper, we
      define “molecular subtypes” of lung cancer based on specific actionable genetic
      aberrations. Each subtype is associated with molecular tests that define the
      subtype and drugs that may potentially treat it. We hope this paper will be a
      useful guide to clinicians and researchers alike by assisting in therapy decision
      making and acting as a platform for further study. In this new era of cancer
      treatment, the ‘one-size-fits-all’ paradigm is being forcibly pushed
      aside—allowing for more effective, personalized oncologic care to emerge.

TI  - Phosphorylation Provides a Negative Mode of Regulation for the Yeast Rab GTPase
      Sec4p.
LID - e24332
AB  - The Rab family of Ras-related GTPases are part of a complex signaling circuitry
      in eukaryotic cells, yet we understand little about the mechanisms that underlie 
      Rab protein participation in such signal transduction networks, or how these
      networks are integrated at the physiological level. Reversible protein
      phosphorylation is widely used by cells as a signaling mechanism. Several
      phospho-Rabs have been identified, however the functional consequences of the
      modification appear to be diverse and need to be evaluated on an individual
      basis. In this study we demonstrate a role for phosphorylation as a negative
      regulatory event for the action of the yeast Rab GTPase Sec4p in regulating
      polarized growth. Our data suggest that the phosphorylation of the Rab Sec4p
      prevents interactions with its effector, the exocyst component Sec15p, and that
      the inhibition may be relieved by a PP2A phosphatase complex containing the
      regulatory subunit Cdc55p.

TI  - Identification of a Phosphorylation-Dependent Nuclear Localization Motif in
      Interferon Regulatory Factor 2 Binding Protein 2.
LID - e24100
AB  - Background: Interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2 (IRF2BP2) is a
      muscle-enriched transcription factor required to activate vascular endothelial
      growth factor-A (VEGFA) expression in muscle. IRF2BP2 is found in the nucleus of 
      cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. During the process of skeletal muscle
      differentiation, some IRF2BP2 becomes relocated to the cytoplasm, although the
      functional significance of this relocation and the mechanisms that control
      nucleocytoplasmic localization of IRF2BP2 are not yet known.
      Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, by fusing IRF2BP2 to green fluorescent
      protein and testing a series of deletion and site-directed mutagenesis
      constructs, we mapped the nuclear localization signal (NLS) to an evolutionarily 
      conserved sequence 354ARKRKPSP361 in IRF2BP2. This sequence corresponds to a
      classical nuclear localization motif bearing positively charged arginine and
      lysine residues. Substitution of arginine and lysine with negatively charged
      aspartic acid residues blocked nuclear localization. However, these residues were
      not sufficient because nuclear targeting of IRF2BP2 also required phosphorylation
      of serine 360 (S360). Many large-scale phosphopeptide proteomic studies had
      reported previously that serine 360 of IRF2BP2 is phosphorylated in numerous
      human cell types. Alanine substitution at this site abolished IRF2BP2 nuclear
      localization in C2C12 myoblasts and CV1 cells. In contrast, substituting serine
      360 with aspartic acid forced nuclear retention and prevented cytoplasmic
      redistribution in differentiated C2C12 muscle cells. As for the effects of these 
      mutations on VEGFA promoter activity, the S360A mutation interfered with VEGFA
      activation, as expected. Surprisingly, the S360D mutation also interfered with
      VEGFA activation, suggesting that this mutation, while enforcing nuclear entry,
      may disrupt an essential activation function of IRF2BP2.
      Conclusions/Significance: Nuclear localization of IRF2BP2 depends on
      phosphorylation near a conserved NLS. Changes in phosphorylation status likely
      control nucleocytoplasmic localization of IRF2BP2 during muscle differentiation.

TI  - Phosphoproteomics Identifies Oncogenic Ras Signaling Targets and Their
      Involvement in Lung Adenocarcinomas.
LID - e20199
AB  - Background: Ras is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers, including
      lung cancer, leading to constitutive activation of MAPK signaling. Despite
      decades of research focused on the Ras oncogene, Ras-targeted phosphorylation
      events and signaling pathways have not been described on a proteome-wide scale.
      Methodology/Principal Findings: By functional phosphoproteomics, we studied the
      molecular mechanics of oncogenic Ras signaling using a pathway-based approach. We
      identified Ras-regulated phosphorylation events (n = 77) using label-free
      comparative proteomics analysis of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells 
      with and without the expression of oncogenic Ras. Many were newly identified as
      potential targets of the Ras signaling pathway. A majority (∼60%) of the
      Ras-targeted events consisted of a [pSer/Thr]-Pro motif, indicating the
      involvement of proline-directed kinases. By integrating the phosphorylated
      signatures into the Pathway Interaction Database, we further inferred
      Ras-regulated pathways, including MAPK signaling and other novel cascades, in
      governing diverse functions such as gene expression, apoptosis, cell growth, and 
      RNA processing. Comparisons of Ras-regulated phosphorylation events, pathways,
      and related kinases in lung cancer-derived cells supported a role of oncogenic
      Ras signaling in lung adenocarcinoma A549 and H322 cells, but not in large cell
      carcinoma H1299 cells. Conclusions/Significance: This study reveals
      phosphorylation events, signaling networks, and molecular functions that are
      regulated by oncogenic Ras. The results observed in this study may aid to extend 
      our knowledge on Ras signaling in lung cancer.

TI  - The Participation of Calponin in the Cross Talk between 20-Hydroxyecdysone and
      Juvenile Hormone Signaling Pathways by Phosphorylation Variation.
LID - e19776
AB  - 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH) signaling pathways interact to
      mediate insect development, but the mechanism of this interaction is poorly
      understood. Here, a calponin homologue domain (Chd) containing protein (HaCal) is
      reported to play a key role in the cross talk between 20E and JH signaling by
      varying its phosphorylation. Chd is known as an actin binding domain present in
      many proteins including some signaling proteins. Using an epidermal cell line
      (HaEpi), HaCal was found to be up-regulated by either 20E or the JH analog
      methoprene (JHA). 20E induced rapid phosphorylation of HaCal whereas no
      phosphorylation occurred with JHA. HaCal could be quickly translocated into the
      nuclei through 20E or JH signaling but interacted with USP1 only under the
      mediation of JHA. Knockdown of HaCal by RNAi blocked the 20E inducibility of
      USP1, PKC and HR3, and also blocked the JHA inducibility of USP1, PKC and JHi.
      After gene silencing of HaCal by ingestion of dsHaCal expressed by Escherichia
      coli, the larval development was arrested and the gene expression of USP1, PKC,
      HR3 and JHi were blocked. These composite data suggest that HaCal plays roles in 
      hormonal signaling by quickly transferring into nucleus to function as a
      phosphorylated form in the 20E pathway and as a non-phosphorylated form
      interacting with USP1 in the JH pathway to facilitate 20E or JH signaling
      cascade, in short, by switching its phosphorylation status to regulate insect
      development.

TI  - Identification of Phosphoproteins as Possible Differentiation Markers in
      All-Trans-Retinoic Acid-Treated Neuroblastoma Cells.
LID - e18254
AB  - Background: Neuroblastic tumors account for 9–10% of pediatric tumors and
      neuroblastoma (NB) is the first cause of death in pre-school age children. NB is 
      classified in four stages, depending on the extent of spreading. A fifth type of 
      NB, so-called stage 4S (S for special), includes patients with metastatic tumors 
      but with an overall survival that approximates 75% at five years. In most of
      these cases, the tumor regresses spontaneously and regression is probably
      associated with delayed neuroblast cell differentiation. Methodology/Principal
      Findings: In order to identify new early markers to follow and predict this
      process for diagnostic and therapeutics intents, we mimicked the differentiation 
      process treating NB cell line SJ-NK-P with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) at
      different times; therefore the cell proteomic pattern by mass spectrometry and
      the phosphoproteomic pattern by a 2-DE approach coupled with anti-phosphoserine
      and anti-phosphotyrosine western blotting were studied. Conclusions/Significance:
      Proteomic analysis identified only two proteins whose expression was
      significantly different in treated cells versus control cells: nucleoside
      diphosphate kinase A (NDKA) and reticulocalbin-1 (RCN1), which were both
      downregulated after 9 days of ATRA treatment. However, phosphoproteomic analysis 
      identified 8 proteins that were differentially serine-phosphorylated and 3 that
      were differentially tyrosine-phosphorylated after ATRA treatment. All proteins
      were significantly regulated (at least 0.5-fold down-regulated). Our results
      suggest that differentially phosphorylated proteins could be considered as more
      promising markers of differentiation for NB than differentially expressed
      proteins.

TI  - Survey of Activated FLT3 Signaling in Leukemia.
LID - e19169
AB  - Activating mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) are found in
      approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3 is
      therefore an attractive drug target. However, the molecular mechanisms by which
      FLT3 mutations lead to cell transformation in AML remain unclear. To develop a
      better understanding of FLT3 signaling as well as its downstream effectors, we
      performed detailed phosphoproteomic analysis of FLT3 signaling in human leukemia 
      cells. We identified over 1000 tyrosine phosphorylation sites from about 750
      proteins in both AML (wild type and mutant FLT3) and B cell acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (normal and amplification of FLT3) cell lines. Furthermore, using stable
      isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we were able to
      quantified over 400 phosphorylation sites (pTyr, pSer, and pThr) that were
      responsive to FLT3 inhibition in FLT3 driven human leukemia cell lines. We also
      extended this phosphoproteomic analysis on bone marrow from primary AML patient
      samples, and identify over 200 tyrosine and 800 serine/threonine phosphorylation 
      sites in vivo. This study showed that oncogenic FLT3 regulates proteins involving
      diverse cellular processes and affects multiple signaling pathways in human
      leukemia that we previously appreciated, such as Fc epsilon RI-mediated
      signaling, BCR, and CD40 signaling pathways. It provides a valuable resource for 
      investigation of oncogenic FLT3 signaling in human leukemia.

      development of novel therapeutics targeting selective biological effects of a
      given receptor. Several studies on pathway separation have been performed, many
      of these on the Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). It has been shown that
      certain ligands or mutations facilitate internalization and/or recruitment of
      β-arrestins without activation of G proteins. However, the underlying molecular
      mechanisms remain largely unresolved. For instance, it is unclear whether such
      selective G protein-uncoupling is caused by a lack of ability to interact with G 
      proteins or rather by an increased ability of the receptor to recruit
      β-arrestins. Since uncoupling of G proteins by increased ability to recruit
      β-arrestins could lead to different cellular or in vivo outcomes than lack of
      ability to interact with G proteins, it is essential to distinguish between these
      two mechanisms. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied five AT1R mutants
      previously published to display pathway separation: D74N, DRY/AAY, Y292F, N298A, 
      and Y302F (Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering: 2.50, 3.49–3.51, 7.43, 7.49, and
      7.53). We find that D74N, DRY/AAY, and N298A mutants are more prone to β-arrestin
      recruitment than WT. In contrast, receptor mutants Y292F and Y302F showed
      impaired ability to recruit β-arrestin in response to Sar1-Ile4-Ile8 (SII) Ang
      II, a ligand solely activating the β-arrestin pathway. Conclusions/Significance: 
      Our analysis reveals that the underlying conformations induced by these AT1R
      mutants most likely represent principally different mechanisms of uncoupling the 
      G protein, which for some mutants may be due to their increased ability to
      recruit β-arrestin2. Hereby, these findings have important implications for drug 
      discovery and 7TMR biology and illustrate the necessity of uncovering the exact
      molecular determinants for G protein-coupling and β-arrestin recruitment,
      respectively.

TI  - Independent Interactions of Phosphorylated β-Catenin with E-Cadherin at Cell-Cell
      Contacts and APC at Cell Protrusions.
LID - e14127
AB  - Background: The APC tumour suppressor functions in several cellular processes
      including the regulation of β-catenin in Wnt signalling and in cell adhesion and 
      migration. Findings: In this study, we establish that in epithelial cells
      N-terminally phosphorylated β-catenin specifically localises to several
      subcellular sites including cell-cell contacts and the ends of cell protrusions. 
      N-terminally phosphorylated β-catenin associates with E-cadherin at adherens
      junctions and with APC in cell protrusions. We isolated APC-rich protrusions from
      stimulated cells and detected β-catenin, GSK3β and CK1α, but not axin. The
      APC/phospho-β-catenin complex in cell protrusions appears to be distinct from the
      APC/axin/β-catenin destruction complex. GSK3β phosphorylates the APC-associated
      population of β-catenin, but not the cell junction population. β-catenin
      associated with APC is rapidly phosphorylated and dephosphorylated. HGF and
      wound-induced cell migration promote the localised accumulation of APC and
      phosphorylated β-catenin at the leading edge of migrating cells. APC siRNA and
      analysis of colon cancer cell lines show that functional APC is required for
      localised phospho-β-catenin accumulation in cell protrusions. Conclusions: We
      conclude that N-terminal phosphorylation of β-catenin does not necessarily lead
      to its degradation but instead marks distinct functions, such as cell migration
      and/or adhesion processes. Localised regulation of APC-phospho-β-catenin
      complexes may contribute to the tumour suppressor activity of APC.

TI  - Phosphoproteomics-Based Modeling Defines the Regulatory Mechanism Underlying
      Aberrant EGFR Signaling.
LID - e13926
AB  - Background: Mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) results in a 
      discordant cell signaling, leading to the development of various diseases.
      However, the mechanism underlying the alteration of downstream signaling due to
      such mutation has not yet been completely understood at the system level. Here,
      we report a phosphoproteomics-based methodology for characterizing the regulatory
      mechanism underlying aberrant EGFR signaling using computational network
      modeling. Methodology/Principal Findings: Our phosphoproteomic analysis of the
      mutation at tyrosine 992 (Y992), one of the multifunctional docking sites of
      EGFR, revealed network-wide effects of the mutation on EGF signaling in a
      time-resolved manner. Computational modeling based on the temporal activation
      profiles enabled us to not only rediscover already-known protein interactions
      with Y992 and internalization property of mutated EGFR but also further gain
      model-driven insights into the effect of cellular content and the regulation of
      EGFR degradation. Our kinetic model also suggested critical reactions
      facilitating the reconstruction of the diverse effects of the mutation on
      phosphoproteome dynamics. Conclusions/Significance: Our integrative approach
      provided a mechanistic description of the disorders of mutated EGFR signaling
      networks, which could facilitate the development of a systematic strategy toward 
      controlling disease-related cell signaling.

TI  - Proteins Involved in Platelet Signaling Are Differentially Regulated in Acute
      Coronary Syndrome: A Proteomic Study.
LID - e13404
AB  - Background: Platelets play a fundamental role in pathological events underlying
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Because platelets do not have a nucleus,
      proteomics constitutes an optimal approach to follow platelet molecular events
      associated with the onset of the acute episode. Methodology/Principal Findings:
      We performed the first high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based 
      proteome analysis of circulating platelets from patients with non-ST segment
      elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). Proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and
      validations were by western blotting. Forty protein features (corresponding to 22
      unique genes) were found to be differentially regulated between NSTE-ACS patients
      and matched controls with chronic ischemic cardiopathy. The number of differences
      decreased at day 5 (28) and 6 months after the acute event (5). Interestingly, a 
      systems biology approach demonstrated that 16 of the 22 differentially regulated 
      proteins identified are interconnected as part of a common network related to
      cell assembly and organization and cell morphology, processes very related to
      platelet activation. Indeed, 14 of those proteins are either signaling or
      cytoskeletal, and nine of them are known to participate in platelet activation by
      αIIbβ3 and/or GPVI receptors. Several of the proteins identified participate in
      platelet activation through post-translational modifications, as shown here for
      ILK, Src and Talin. Interestingly, the platelet-secreted glycoprotein SPARC was
      down-regulated in NSTE-ACS patients compared to stable controls, which is
      consistent with a secretion process from activated platelets.
      Conclusions/Significance: The present study provides novel information on
      platelet proteome changes associated with platelet activation in NSTE-ACS,
      highlighting the presence of proteins involved in platelet signaling. This
      investigation paves the way for future studies in the search for novel
      platelet-related biomarkers and drug targets in ACS.

TI  - Raptor is Phosphorylated by cdc2 during Mitosis.
LID - e9197
AB  - Background: The appropriate control of mitotic entry and exit is reliant on a
      series of interlocking signaling events that coordinately drive the biological
      processes required for accurate cell division. Overlaid onto these signals that
      promote orchestrated cell division are checkpoints that ensure appropriate
      mitotic spindle formation, a lack of DNA damage, kinetochore attachment, and that
      each daughter cell has the appropriate complement of DNA. We recently discovered 
      that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) modulates the G2/M phase of cell cycle
      progression in part through its suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) signaling. AMPK directly phosphorylates the critical mTOR binding partner 
      raptor inhibiting mTORC1 (mTOR-raptor rapamycin sensitive mTOR kinase complex 1).
      As mTOR has been previously tied to mitotic control, we examined further how
      raptor may contribute to this process. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have
      discovered that raptor becomes highly phosphorylated in cells in mitosis.
      Utilizing tandem mass spectrometry, we identified a number of novel
      phosphorylation sites in raptor, and using phospho-specific antibodies
      demonstrated that raptor becomes phosphorylated on
      phospho-serine/threonine-proline sites in mitosis. A combination of site-directed
      mutagenesis in a tagged raptor cDNA and analysis with a series of new
      phospho-specific antibodies generated against different sites in raptor revealed 
      that Serine 696 and Threonine 706 represent two key sites in raptor
      phosphorylated in mitosis. We demonstrate that the mitotic cyclin-dependent
      kinase cdc2/CDK1 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating these sites, and
      its mitotic partner Cyclin B efficiently coimmunoprecipitates with raptor in
      mitotic cells. Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates that the key
      mTOR binding partner raptor is directly phosphorylated during mitosis by cdc2.
      This reinforces previous studies suggesting that mTOR activity is highly
      regulated and important for mitotic progression, and points to a direct
      modulation of the mTORC1 complex during mitosis.

TI  - Sequence Alignment Reveals Possible MAPK Docking Motifs on HIV Proteins.
LID - e8942
AB  - Over the course of HIV infection, virus replication is facilitated by the
      phosphorylation of HIV proteins by human ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein 
      kinases (MAPKs). MAPKs are known to phosphorylate their substrates by first
      binding with them at a docking site. Docking site interactions could be viable
      drug targets because the sequences guiding them are more specific than
      phosphorylation consensus sites. In this study we use multiple bioinformatics
      tools to discover candidate MAPK docking site motifs on HIV proteins known to be 
      phosphorylated by MAPKs, and we discuss the possibility of targeting docking
      sites with drugs. Using sequence alignments of HIV proteins of different
      subtypes, we show that MAPK docking patterns previously described for human
      proteins appear on the HIV matrix, Tat, and Vif proteins in a strain dependent
      manner, but are absent from HIV Rev and appear on all HIV Nef strains. We revise 
      the regular expressions of previously annotated MAPK docking patterns in order to
      provide a subtype independent motif that annotates all HIV proteins. One revision
      is based on a documented human variant of one of the substrate docking motifs,
      and the other reduces the number of required basic amino acids in the standard
      docking motifs from two to one. The proposed patterns are shown to be consistent 
      with in silico docking between ERK1 and the HIV matrix protein. The motif usage
      on HIV proteins is sufficiently different from human proteins in amino acid
      sequence similarity to allow for HIV specific targeting using small-molecule
      drugs.

TI  - Dissecting the Signaling Events That Impact Classical Nuclear Import and Target
      Nuclear Transport Factors.
LID - e8420
AB  - Background: Signaling through MEK→ERK1/2 and PI3 kinases is implicated in many
      aspects of cell physiology, including the survival of oxidant exposure. Oxidants 
      play a role in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes, many of
      which rely on transport in and out of the nucleus. However, how oxidative stress 
      impacts nuclear trafficking is not well defined. Methodology/Principal Findings: 
      To better understand the effect of stress on nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, we
      exposed cells to the oxidant diethyl maleate. This treatment activated MEK→ERK1/2
      as well as PI3 kinase→Akt cascades and triggered the inhibition of classical
      nuclear import. To define the molecular mechanisms that regulate nuclear
      transport, we examined whether MEK and PI3 kinase signaling affected the
      localization of key transport factors. Using recently developed tools for image
      acquisition and analysis, the subcellular distributions of importin-α, CAS, and
      nucleoporins Nup153 and Nup88 were quantified in different cellular compartments.
      These studies identified specific profiles for the localization of transport
      factors in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and at the nuclear envelope. Our results
      demonstrate that MEK and PI3 kinase signaling as well as oxidative stress control
      nuclear trafficking and the localization of transport components. Furthermore,
      stress not only induced changes in transport factor distribution, but also
      upregulated post-translational modification of transport factors. Our results are
      consistent with the idea that the phosphorylation of importin-α, CAS, Nup153, and
      Nup88, and the O-GlcNAc modification of Nup153 increase when cells are exposed to
      oxidant. Conclusions/Significance: Our studies defined the complex regulation of 
      classical nuclear import and identified key transport factors that are targeted
      by stress, MEK, and PI3 kinase signaling.

      eukaryotic cells is the conserved Rho GTPase, Cdc42. In budding yeast, Cdc42 is
      activated by a single guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Cdc24. The mechanistic 
      details of Cdc24 activation at the onset of yeast cell polarization are unclear. 
      Previous studies have suggested an important role for phosphorylation of Cdc24,
      which may regulate activity or function of the protein, representing a key step
      in the symmetry breaking process. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we
      directly ask whether multisite phosphorylation of Cdc24 plays a role in its
      regulation. We identify through mass spectrometry analysis over thirty putative
      in vivo phosphorylation sites. We first focus on sites matching consensus
      sequences for cyclin-dependent and p21-activated kinases, two kinase families
      that have been previously shown to phosphorylate Cdc24. Through site-directed
      mutagenesis, yeast genetics, and light and fluorescence microscopy, we show that 
      nonphosphorylatable mutations of these consensus sites do not lead to any
      detectable consequences on growth rate, morphology, kinetics of polarization, or 
      localization of the mutant protein. We do, however, observe a change in the
      mobility shift of mutant Cdc24 proteins on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that we have
      indeed perturbed its phosphorylation. Finally, we show that mutation of all
      identified phosphorylation sites does not cause observable defects in growth rate
      or morphology. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that lack of phosphorylation
      on Cdc24 has no overt functional consequences in budding yeast. Yeast cell
      polarization may be more tightly regulated by inactivation of Cdc42 by GTPase
      activating proteins or by alternative methods of Cdc24 regulation, such as
      conformational changes or oligomerization.

TI  - Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) Mediated Tyrosine Phosphor-Proteome from
      Drosophila S2 (ErbB1) Cells Reveals Novel Signaling Networks.
LID - e2877
AB  - Protein phosphorylation mediates many critical cellular responses and is
      essential for many biological functions during development. About one-third of
      cellular proteins are phosphorylated, representing the phosphor-proteome, and
      phosphorylation can alter a protein's function, activity, localization and
      stability. Tyrosine phosphorylation events mediated by aberrant activation of
      Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) pathways have been proven to be involved in the
      development of several diseases including cancer. To understand the systems
      biology of RTK activation, we have developed a phosphor-proteome focused on
      tyrosine phosphorylation events under insulin and EGF signaling pathways using
      the PhosphoScan® technique coupled with high-throughput mass spectrometry
      analysis. Comparative proteomic analyses of all these tyrosine phosphorylation
      events revealed that around 70% of these pY events are conserved in human
      orthologs and paralogs. A careful analysis of published in vivo tyrosine
      phosphorylation events from literature and patents revealed that around 38% of pY
      events from Drosophila proteins conserved on 185 human proteins are confirmed in 
      vivo tyrosine phosphorylation events. Hence the data are validated partially
      based on available reports, and the credibility of the remaining 62% of novel
      conserved sites that are unpublished so far is very high but requires further
      follow-up studies. The novel pY events found in this study that are conserved on 
      human proteins could potentially lead to the discovery of drug targets and
      biomarkers for the detection of various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Analysis of EGFR signaling pathway in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by
      quantitative phosphoproteomics.
PG  - 35
AB  - Background: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is usually overexpressed 
      in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and is associated with pathogenesis of NPC.
      However, the downstream signaling proteins of EGFR in NPC have not yet been
      completely understood at the system level. The aim of this study was identify
      novel downstream proteins of EGFR signaling pathway in NPC cells. Results: We
      analyzed EGFR-regulated phosphoproteome in NPC CNE2 cells using 2D-DIGE and mass 
      spectrometry analysis after phosphoprotein enrichment. As a result, 33
      nonredundant phosphoproteins including five known EGFR-regulated proteins and
      twenty-eight novel EGFR-regulated proteins in CNE2 were identified, three
      differential phosphoproteins were selectively validated, and two differential
      phosphoproteins (GSTP1 and GRB2) were showed interacted with phospho-EGFR.
      Bioinformatics analysis showed that 32 of 33 identified proteins contain
      phosphorylation modification sites, and 17 identified proteins are signaling
      proteins. GSTP1, one of the EGFR-regulated proteins, associated with
      chemoresistance was analyzed. The results showed that GSTP1 could contribute to
      paclitaxel resistance in EGF-stimulated CNE2 cells. Furthermore, an EGFR
      signaling network based on the identified EGFR-regulated phosphoproteins were
      constructed using Pathway Studio 5.0 software, which includes canonical and novel
      EGFR-regulated proteins and implicates the possible biological roles for those
      proteins. Conclusion: The data not only can extend our knowledge of canonical
      EGFR signaling, but also will be useful to understand the molecular mechanisms of
      EGFR in NPC pathogenesis and search therapeutic targets for NPC.

AB  - An encouraging approach for the diagnosis and effective therapy of immunological 
      pathologies, which would include cancer, is the identification of proteins and
      phosphorylated proteins. Disease proteomics, in particular, is a potentially
      useful method for this purpose. A key role is played by protein phosphorylation
      in the regulation of normal immunology disorders and targets for several new
      cancer drugs and drug candidates are cancer cells and protein kinases. Protein
      phosphorylation is a highly dynamic process. The functioning of new drugs is of
      major importance as is the selection of those patients who would respond best to 
      a specific treatment regime. In all major aspects of cellular life signalling
      networks are key elements which play a major role in inter- and intracellular
      communications. They are involved in diverse processes such as cell-cycle
      progression, cellular metabolism, cell-cell communication and appropriate
      response to the cellular environment. A whole range of networks that are involved
      in the regulation of cell development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis,
      and immunologic responses is contained in the latter. It is so necessary to
      understand and monitor kinase signalling pathways in order to understand many
      immunology pathologies. Enrichment of phosphorylated proteins or peptides from
      tissue or bodily fluid samples is required. The application of technologies such 
      as immunoproteomic techniques, phosphoenrichments and mass spectrometry (MS) is
      crucial for the identification and quantification of protein phosphorylation
      sites in order to advance in clinical research. Pharmacodynamic readouts of
      disease states and cellular drug responses in tumour samples will be provided as 
      the field develops. We aim to detail the current and most useful techniques with 
      research examples to isolate and carry out clinical phosphoproteomic studies
      which may be helpful for immunology and cancer research. Different phosphopeptide
      enrichment and quantitative techniques need to be combined to achieve good
      phosphopeptide recovery and good up- and-down phospho-regulation protein studies.

TI  - Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid Treatment Reveals Crosstalks among Proteome,
      Ubiquitylome and Acetylome in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer A549 Cell Line.
LID - 9520
AB  - Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is a well-known histone deacetylase (HDAC)
      inhibitor and has been used as practical therapy for breast cancer and non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is previously demonstrated that SAHA treatment could
      extensively change the profile of acetylome and proteome in cancer cells.
      However, little is known about the impact of SAHA on other protein modifications 
      and the crosstalks among different modifications and proteome, hindering the deep
      understanding of SAHA-mediated cancer therapy. In this work, by using SILAC
      technique, antibody-based affinity enrichment and high-resolution LC-MS/MS
      analysis, we investigated quantitative proteome, acetylome and ubiquitylome as
      well as crosstalks among the three datasets in A549 cells toward SAHA treatment. 
      In total, 2968 proteins, 1099 acetylation sites and 1012 ubiquitination sites
      were quantified in response to SAHA treatment, respectively. With the aid of
      intensive bioinformatics, we revealed that the proteome and ubiquitylome were
      negatively related upon SAHA treatment. Moreover, the impact of SAHA on acetylome
      resulted in 258 up-regulated and 99 down-regulated acetylation sites at the
      threshold of 1.5 folds. Finally, we identified 55 common sites with both
      acetylation and ubiquitination, among which ubiquitination level in 43 sites
      (78.2%) was positive related to acetylation level.

TI  - Interactome analysis of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α1 and -β1 in INS-1
      pancreatic beta-cells by affinity purification-mass spectrometry.
LID - 4376
AB  - The heterotrimeric enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a major
      metabolic factor that regulates the homeostasis of cellular energy. In
      particular, AMPK mediates the insulin resistance that is associated with type 2
      diabetes. Generally, cellular processes require tight regulation of protein
      kinases, which is effected through their formation of complex with other proteins
      and substrates. Despite their critical function in regulation and pathogenesis,
      there are limited data on the interaction of protein kinases. To identify
      proteins that interact with AMPK, we performed large-scale affinity purification 
      (AP)-mass spectrometry (MS) of the AMPK-α1 and -β1 subunits. Through a
      comprehensive analysis, using a combination of immunoprecipitaion and ion trap
      mass spectrometry, we identified 381 unique proteins in the AMPKα/β interactomes:
      325 partners of AMPK-α1 and 243 for AMPK-β1. Further, we identified 196 novel
      protein-protein interactions with AMPK-α1 and AMPK-β1. Notably, in our
      bioinformatics analysis, the novel interaction partners mediated functions that
      are related to the regulation of actin organization. Specifically, several such
      proteins were linked to pancreatic beta-cell functions, including
      glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, beta-cell development, beta-cell
      differentiation, and cell-cell communication.

TI  - The mutational landscape of phosphorylation signaling in cancer.
LID - 2651
AB  - Somatic mutations in cancer genomes include drivers that provide selective
      advantages to tumor cells and passengers present due to genome instability.
      Discovery of pan-cancer drivers will help characterize biological systems
      important in multiple cancers and lead to development of better therapies. Driver
      genes are most often identified by their recurrent mutations across tumor
      samples. However, some mutations are more important for protein function than
      others. Thus considering the location of mutations with respect to functional
      protein sites can predict their mechanisms of action and improve the sensitivity 
      of driver gene detection. Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational
      modification central to cancer biology and treatment, and frequently altered by
      driver mutations. Here we used our ActiveDriver method to analyze known
      phosphorylation sites mutated by single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in The Cancer 
      Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) pan-cancer dataset of 3,185 genomes and 12
      cancer types. Phosphorylation-related SNVs (pSNVs) occur in ~90% of tumors, show 
      increased conservation and functional mutation impact compared to other
      protein-coding mutations, and are enriched in cancer genes and pathways.
      Gene-centric analysis found 150 known and candidate cancer genes with significant
      pSNV recurrence. Using a novel computational method, we predict that 29% of these
      mutations directly abolish phosphorylation or modify kinase target sites to
      rewire signaling pathways. This analysis shows that incorporation of information 
      about protein signaling sites will improve computational pipelines for variant
      function prediction.

TI  - The Adaptor Protein p66Shc Inhibits mTOR-Dependent Anabolic Metabolism.
PG  - ra17
AB  - Adaptor proteins link surface receptors to intracellular signaling pathways, and 
      potentially control the way cells respond to nutrient availability. Mice
      deficient in p66Shc, the most-recently evolved isoform of the Shc1 adaptor
      proteins and a mediator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling display resistance 
      to diabetes and obesity. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that
      p66Shc inhibited glucose metabolism. Depletion of p66Shc enhanced glycolysis and 
      increased the allocation of glucose-derived carbon into anabolic metabolism,
      characteristics of a metabolic shift called the Warburg effect. This change in
      metabolism was mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), because
      inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin reversed the glycolytic phenotype caused by
      p66Shc deficiency. Thus, unlike the other isoforms of Shc1, p66Shc appears to
      antagonize insulin and mTOR signaling, which limits glucose uptake and
      metabolism. Our results identify a critical inhibitory role for p66Shc in
      anabolic metabolism.

TI  - The Transcription Factor TFEB Links mTORC1 Signaling to Transcriptional Control
      of Lysosome Homeostasis.
PG  - ra42
AB  - Lysosomes are the major cellular site for clearance of defective organelles and
      digestion of internalized material. Demand on lysosomal capacity varies greatly, 
      but the mechanisms that adjust lysosomal function to maintain cellular
      homeostasis are unknown. In this study, we identify an interaction between mTOR
      and the TFEB transcription factor on the surface of lysosomes that allows mTOR to
      transduce signals arising from changes in lysosomal status to TFEB and thus
      control the ability of TFEB to enter the nucleus. This occurs via regulation of
      the serine 211 phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins to TFEB.
      These results identify TFEB as a novel target of mTOR that couples the
      transcriptional regulation of genes encoding proteins of autophagosomes and
      lysosomes to cellular need. We further present evidence that the closely related 
      MITF and TFE3 transcription factors are regulated in a similar manner, thus
      broadening the range of physiological contexts under which such regulation may
      prove important.

TI  - Global Phosphoproteomics Reveals Crosstalk between Bcr-Abl and Negative Feedback 
      Mechanisms Controlling Src Signaling.
PG  - ra18
AB  - In subtypes and late stages of leukemias driven by the tyrosine kinase fusion
      protein Bcr-Abl, Src signaling critically contributes to the leukemic phenotype. 
      We performed global tyrosine phosphoprofiling using quantitative mass
      spectrometry of Bcr-Abl transformed cells in which the activities of the Src
      family kinases (SFKs) were perturbed to build a detailed context-dependent
      network of cancer signaling. Perturbation of the SFKs Lyn and Hck with genetics
      or inhibitors revealed Bcr-Abl downstream phosphorylation events either mediated 
      by or independent of SFKs. We identified multiple negative feedback mechanisms
      within the network of signaling events affected by Bcr-Abl and SFKs, and found
      that Bcr-Abl attenuated these inhibitory mechanisms. The Csk binding protein Pag1
      (also known as Cbp) and the tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn18 both mediated negative
      feedback to SFKs. We observed Bcr-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of the phosphatase
      Shp2 (Ptpn11) and this may contribute to the suppression of these negative
      feedback mechanisms to promote Bcr-Abl-activated SFK signaling. Csk and a
      kinase-deficient Csk mutant both produced similar globally repressive signaling
      consequences, suggesting a critical role for the adaptor protein function of Csk 
      in its inhibition of Bcr-Abl and SFK signaling. The identified Bcr-Abl-activated 
      SFK regulatory mechanisms are candidates for dysregulation during leukemia
      progression and acquisition of SFK-mediated drug resistance.

TI  - ABL Tyrosine Kinases: Evolution of Function, Regulation, and Specificity*.
PG  - re6
AB  - ABL-family proteins comprise one of the best conserved branches of the tyrosine
      kinases. Each ABL protein contains an SH3-SH2-TK (Src homology 3–Src homology
      2–tyrosine kinase) domain cassette, which confers autoregulated kinase activity
      and is common among nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. This cassette is coupled to an 
      actin-binding and -bundling domain, which makes ABL proteins capable of
      connecting phosphoregulation with actin-filament reorganization. Two vertebrate
      paralogs, ABL1 and ABL2, have evolved to perform specialized functions. ABL1
      includes nuclear localization signals and a DNA binding domain through which it
      mediates DNA damage-repair functions, whereas ABL2 has additional binding
      capacity for actin and for microtubules to enhance its cytoskeletal remodeling
      functions. Several types of posttranslational modifications control ABL catalytic
      activity, subcellular localization, and stability, with consequences for both
      cytoplasmic and nuclear ABL functions. Binding partners provide additional
      regulation of ABL catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and downstream
      signaling. Information on ABL regulatory mechanisms is being mined to provide new
      therapeutic strategies against hematopoietic malignancies caused by BCR-ABL1 and 
      related leukemogenic proteins.

TI  - Akt-RSK-S6-kinase Signaling Networks Activated by Oncogenic Receptor Tyrosine
      Kinases.
PG  - ra64
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activate pathways mediated by serine/threonine
      (Ser/Thr) kinases such as the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)-Akt pathway,
      the Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-RSK pathway, and the mTOR
      (mammalian target of rapamycin)-p70 S6 pathway that control important aspects of 
      cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The Akt, RSK, and p70 S6 family of
      protein kinases transmit signals by phosphorylating substrates on a RxRxxS/T
      motif. Here, we developed a large-scale proteomic approach to identify over 200
      substrates of this kinase family in cancer cell lines driven by the c-Met,
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or platelet-derived growth factor
      receptor a (PDGFRα) RTKs. We identified a subset of proteins with RxRxxS/T sites 
      for which phosphorylation was decreased by RTKIs as well as by inhibitors of the 
      PI3K, mTOR, and MAPK pathways and determined the effects of siRNA directed
      against these substrates on cell viability. We found that phosphorylation of the 
      protein chaperone SGTA (small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing 
      protein alpha) at Ser305 is essential for PDGFRα stabilization and cell survival 
      in PDGFRα-dependent cancer cells. Our approach provides a new view of RTK and
      Akt-RSK-S6 kinase signaling, revealing many previously unidentified Akt-RSK-S6
      kinase substrates that merit further consideration as targets for combination
      therapy with RTKIs.

TI  - Signaling to Transcription Networks in the Neuronal Retrograde Injury Response.
PG  - ra53
AB  - Retrograde signaling from axon to soma activates intrinsic regeneration
      mechanisms in lesioned peripheral sensory neurons; however, the links between
      axonal injury signaling and the cell body response are not well understood. Here,
      we used phosphoproteomics and microarrays to implicate ~900 phosphoproteins in
      retrograde injury signaling in rat sciatic nerve axons in vivo and ~4500
      transcripts in the in vivo response to injury in the dorsal root ganglia.
      Computational analyses of these data sets identified ~400 redundant axonal
      signaling networks connected to 39 transcription factors implicated in the
      sensory neuron response to axonal injury. Experimental perturbation of individual
      overrepresented signaling hub proteins, including Abl, AKT, p38, and protein
      kinase C, affected neurite outgrowth in sensory neurons. Paradoxically, however, 
      combined perturbation of Abl together with other hub proteins had a reduced
      effect relative to perturbation of individual proteins. Our data indicate that
      nerve injury responses are controlled by multiple regulatory components, and
      suggest that network redundancies provide robustness to the injury response.

TI  - Imatinib and Dasatinib Inhibit Hemangiosarcoma and Implicate PDGFR-β and Src in
      Tumor Growth12.
PG  - 158-68
AB  - Hemangiosarcoma, a natural model of human angiosarcoma, is an aggressive vascular
      tumor diagnosed commonly in dogs. The documented expression of several receptor
      tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by these tumors makes them attractive targets for
      therapeutic intervention using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, we
      possess limited knowledge of the effects of TKIs on hemangiosarcoma as well as
      other soft tissue sarcomas. We report here on the use of the TKIs imatinib and
      dasatinib in canine hemangiosarcoma and their effects on platelet-derived growth 
      factor receptor β (PDGFR-β) and Src inhibition. Both TKIs reduced cell viability,
      but dasatinib was markedly more potent in this regard, mediating cytotoxic
      effects orders of magnitude greater than imatinib. Dasatinib also inhibited the
      phosphorylation of the shared PDGFR-β target at a concentration approximately
      1000 times less than that needed by imatinib and effectively blocked Src
      phosphorylation. Both inhibitors augmented the response to doxorubicin,
      suggesting that clinical responses likely will be improved using both drugs in
      combination; however, dasatinib was significantly (P < .05) more effective in
      this context. Despite the higher concentrations needed in cell-based assays,
      imatinib significantly inhibited tumor growth (P < .05) in a tumor xenograft
      model, highlighting that disruption of PDGFR-β/PDGF signaling may be important in
      targeting the angiogenic nature of these tumors. Treatment of a dog with
      spontaneously occurring hemangiosarcoma established that clinically achievable
      doses of dasatinib may be realized in dogs and provides a means to investigate
      the effect of TKIs on soft tissue sarcomas in a large animal model.

TI  - STAT-Related Profiles Are Associated with Patient Response to Targeted Treatments
      in Locally Advanced SCCHN1.
PG  - 47-58
AB  - The anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab (Erbitux, CTX) is
      currently used for the treatment of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of
      the head and neck (LA-SCCHN), as yet with modest effectiveness, prompting for the
      identification of response predictors to this treatment and for the targeting of 
      additional pathways implicated in this disease. Within this scope, we
      investigated the effect of SRC/STAT pathway components on LA-SCCHN patient
      outcome. SRC, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, ANXA1, CAV1, IGFBP2, EPHA2, EPHB2,
      and MSN relative gene expression, as well as Stat protein activation, were
      assessed on LA-SCCHN tumor tissues from 35 patients treated with combined
      radiotherapy (RT) and CTX-based regimens. Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 proteins were
      usually found activated in neoplastic nuclei (70.4%, 85.7%, and 70.8%,
      respectively). Activated Stat3 and Stat5 were associated with each other (P =
      .017) and with a CAV1high/MSNhigh/IGFBP2low profile. All patients with tumors
      expressing high STAT5A/EPHA2 experienced a complete response on RT-CTX-based
      treatments (12/15 complete responders, P < .0001) and a longer progression-free
      survival (P = .024). Few tumors expressed high ANXA1/CAV1/EPHA2 and low IGFBP2, a
      putative dasatinib response-related profile, whereas high ANXA1 was associated
      with shorter overall survival (P = .003). In conclusion, Stat activation is
      common in LA-SCCHN, where overexpression of STAT5A and EPHA2 may predict for
      response to RT-CTX treatments. The STAT5A/EPHA2 profile seems of particular
      interest for validation in larger cohorts and in multiple tumor types because
      markers for the positive selection of patients to benefit from CTX-containing
      treatments are currently lacking.

TI  - Make Yourself at Home: Viral Hijacking of the PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway.
PG  - 3192-212
AB  - As viruses do not possess genes encoding for proteins required for translation,
      energy metabolism or membrane biosynthesis, they are classified as obligatory
      intracellular parasites that depend on a host cell to replicate. This genome
      limitation forces them to gain control over cellular processes to ensure their
      successful propagation. A diverse spectrum of virally encoded proteins tackling a
      broad spectrum of cellular pathways during most steps of the viral life cycle
      ranging from the host cell entry to viral protein translation has evolved. Since 
      the host cell PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a critical regulatory role in many
      cellular processes including RNA processing, translation, autophagy and
      apoptosis, many viruses, in widely varying ways, target it. This review focuses
      on a number of remarkable examples of viral strategies, which exploit the
      PI3K/Akt signaling pathway for effective viral replication.

TI  - Systems biology approaches to understanding Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition
      (EMT) in mucosal remodeling and signaling in asthma.
PG  - 13
AB  - A pathological hallmark of asthma is chronic injury and repair, producing
      dysfunction of the epithelial barrier function. In this setting, increased
      oxidative stress, growth factor- and cytokine stimulation, together with
      extracellular matrix contact produces transcriptional reprogramming of the
      epithelial cell. This process results in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
      a cellular state associated with loss of epithelial polarity, expression of
      mesenchymal markers, enhanced mobility and extracellular matrix remodeling. As a 
      result, the cellular biology of the EMT state produces characteristic changes
      seen in severe, refractory asthma: myofibroblast expansion, epithelial
      trans-differentiation and subepithelial fibrosis. EMT also induces profound
      changes in epithelial responsiveness that affects innate immune signaling that
      may have impact on the adaptive immune response and effectiveness of
      glucocorticoid therapy in severe asthma. We discuss how this complex phenotype is
      beginning to be understood using systems biology-level approaches through
      perturbations coupled with high throughput profiling and computational modeling. 
      Understanding the distinct changes induced by EMT at the systems level may
      provide translational strategies to reverse the altered signaling and physiology 
      of refractory asthma.
