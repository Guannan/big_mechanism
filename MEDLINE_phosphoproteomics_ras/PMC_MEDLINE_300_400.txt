      Discovery*.
PG  - 1369-82
AB  - Plasma membrane proteins that are exposed on the cell surface have important
      biological functions, such as signaling into and out of the cells, ion transport,
      and cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The expression level of many of the
      plasma membrane proteins involved in these key functions is altered on cancer
      cells, and these proteins may also be subject to post-translational modification,
      such as altered phosphorylation and glycosylation. Additional protein alterations
      on cancer cells confer metastatic capacities, and some of these cell surface
      proteins have already been successfully targeted by protein drugs, such as human 
      antibodies, that have enhanced survival of several groups of cancer patients. The
      combination of novel analytical approaches and subcellular fractionation
      procedures has made it possible to study the plasma membrane proteome in more
      detail, which will elucidate cancer biology, particularly metastasis, and guide
      future development of novel drug targets. The technical advances in plasma
      membrane proteomics and the consequent biological revelations will be discussed
      herein. Many of the advances have been made using cancer cell lines, but because 
      the main goal of this research is to improve individualized treatment and
      increase cancer patient survival, further development is crucial to direct
      analysis of clinically relevant patient samples. These efforts include optimized 
      specimen handling and preparation as well as improved proteomics platforms.
      Identification of potentially useful proteomics-based biomarkers must be
      validated in larger, well defined retrospective and prospective clinical studies,
      and these combined efforts should result in identification of biomarkers that
      will greatly improve early detection, prognosis, and prediction of treatment
      response.

PG  - 1117-34
AB  - Recent structural studies of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have revealed
      unexpected diversity in the mechanisms of their activation by growth factor
      ligands. Strategies for inducing dimerization by ligand binding are surprisingly 
      diverse, as are mechanisms that couple this event to activation of the
      intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. As our understanding of these details
      becomes increasingly sophisticated, it provides an important context for
      therapeutically countering the effects of pathogenic RTK mutations in cancer and 
      other diseases. Much remains to be learned, however, about the complex signaling 
      networks downstream from RTKs and how alterations in these networks are
      translated into cellular responses.

PG  - 547-59
AB  - In mice, Lkb1 deletion and activation of KrasG12D results in lung tumors with a
      high penetrance of lymph node and distant metastases. We analyzed these primary
      and metastatic de novo lung cancers with integrated genomic and proteomic
      profiles and have identified gene and phosphoprotein signatures associated with
      Lkb1 loss and progression to invasive and metastatic lung tumors. These studies
      revealed that SRC is activated in Lkb1 deficient primary and metastatic lung
      tumors and that the combined inhibition of SRC, PI3K and MEK1/2 resulted in
      synergistic tumor regression. These studies demonstrate that integrated genomic
      and proteomic analyses can be used to identify signaling pathways that may be
      targeted for treatment.

TI  - Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell derived models of LEOPARD
      syndrome.
PG  - 808-12
AB  - Generation of reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from patients
      with defined genetic disorders promises important avenues to understand the
      etiologies of complex diseases, and the development of novel therapeutic
      interventions. We have generated iPSC from patients with LEOPARD syndrome (LS;
      acronym of its main features: Lentigines, Electrocardiographic abnormalities,
      Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary valve stenosis, Abnormal genitalia, Retardation
      of growth and Deafness), an autosomal dominant developmental disorder belonging
      to a relatively prevalent class of inherited RAS-MAPK signaling diseases, which
      also includes Noonan syndrome (NS), with pleiomorphic effects on several tissues 
      and organ systems1,2. The patient-derived cells have a mutation in the PTPN11
      gene, which encodes the SHP2 phosphatase. The iPSC have been extensively
      characterized and produce multiple differentiated cell lineages. A major disease 
      phenotype in patients with LEOPARD syndrome is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We
      show that in vitro-derived cardiomyocytes from LS-iPSC are larger, have a higher 
      degree of sarcomeric organization and preferential localization of NFATc4 in the 
      nucleus when compared to cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells
      (HESC) or wild type (wt) iPSC derived from a healthy brother of one of the LS
      patients. These features correlate with a potential hypertrophic state. We also
      provide molecular insights into signaling pathways that may promote the disease
      phenotype.

TI  - QUANTITATIVE PHOSPHOPROTEOMIC ANALYSIS OF T CELL RECEPTOR SIGNALING IN DIABETES
      PRONE AND RESISTANT MICE.
PG  - 3135-45
AB  - Type 1 diabetes, in human patients and NOD mice, results from immune attack on
      insulin-producing beta-cells of the pancreas by autoreactive T lymphocytes. In
      NOD mice, genetically-controlled perturbations in the signaling pathways
      downstream of the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) may be instrumental in
      the altered responses of T cells, manifest as inefficient induction of apoptosis 
      after recognition of self-antigens in the thymus, or as perturbed reactivity of
      mature T cells in peripheral organs. To map this signaling difference(s), we have
      used mass spectrometry-based quantitative phosphoproteomics to compare the
      activation of primary CD4+ T cells of diabetes-prone NOD and -resistant B6.H2g7
      mice. Immunoprecipitation and IMAC purification of tyrosine-phosphorylated
      peptides, combined with a stable-isotope iTRAQ labeling, enabled us to identify
      and quantify over 77 phosphorylation events in 54 different proteins downstream
      of TCR stimulation of primary CD4+ T cells. This analysis showed a generally
      higher level of phosphotyrosine in activated NOD cells, as well as several
      phosphorylation sites that appeared to be differentially regulated in these two
      strains (involving TXK, CD5, PAG1, and ZAP-70). These data highlight the
      differences in signaling between CD4+ T cell compartments of NOD and B6g7 mice,
      and may underlie the dysregulation of T cells in NOD mice.

TI  - Quantitative Proteomics Analysis Reveals Molecular Networks Regulated by
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Level in Head and Neck Cancer.
PG  - 3073-82
AB  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in up to 90% of head and
      neck cancer (HNC), where increased expression levels of EGFR correlate with poor 
      prognosis. To date, EGFR expression levels have not predicted the clinical
      response to the EGFR-targeting therapies. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms
      underlying anti-EGFR-induced antitumor effects may shed some light on the
      mechanisms of HNC resistance to EGFR-targeting therapeutics and provide novel
      targets for improving the treatment of HNC. Here, we conducted a quantitative
      proteomics analysis to determine the molecular networks regulated by EGFR levels 
      in HNC by specifically knocking-down EGFR and employing stable isotope labeling
      with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). Following data normalization to
      minimize systematic errors and Western blotting validation, 12 proteins (e.g.,
      p21, stratifin, and maspin) and 24 proteins (e.g., cdc2 and MTA2) were found to
      be significantly upregulated or downregulated by EGFR knockdown, respectively.
      Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these proteins were mainly involved in
      long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation, cholesterol biosynthesis,
      cell proliferation, DNA replication, and apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis confirmed
      that G2/M phase progression was significantly inhibited by EGFR knockdown, a
      hypothesis generated from network modeling. Further investigation of these
      molecular networks may not only enhance our understanding of the antitumor
      mechanisms of EGFR targeting but also improve patient selection and provide novel
      targets for better therapeutics.

TI  - Activation of aortic endothelial cells by oxidized phospholipids: a
      phosphoproteomic analysis.
PG  - 2812-24
AB  - Previous studies have shown that oxidized products of the phospholipid PAPC
      (Ox-PAPC) are strong activators of aortic endothelial cells and play an important
      role in atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. We and others have
      demonstrated that Ox-PAPC activates specific signaling pathways and regulates a
      large number of genes. Using a phosphoproteomic approach based on phosphopeptide 
      enrichment and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified candidate changes in
      Ox-PAPC-induced protein phosphorylation of 228 proteins. Functional annotation of
      these proteins showed an enrichment of the regulation of cytoskeleton, junctional
      components, and tyrosine kinases, all of which may contribute to the phenotypic
      and molecular changes observed in endothelial cells treated with Ox-PAPC. Many
      changes in protein phosphorylation induced by Ox-PAPC are reported here for the
      first time and provide new insights into the mechanism of activation by oxidized 
      lipids, including phosphorylation-based signal transduction.

TI  - A comparative phosphoproteomic analysis of a human tumor metastasis model using a
      label free quantitative approach.
PG  - 1842-52
AB  - Alterations in cellular phosphorylation patterns have been implicated in a number
      of diseases, including cancer, through multiple mechanisms. Herein we present a
      survey of the phosphorylation profiles of an isogenic pair of human cancer cell
      lines with opposite metastatic phenotype. Phosphopeptides were enriched from
      tumor cell lysates with titanium dioxide and zirconium dioxide, and identified
      with nano-LC-MS/MS using an automatic cross-validation of MS/MS and MS/MS/MS (MS2
      + MS3) data-dependent neutral loss method. A spectral counting quantitative
      strategy was applied to the two cell line samples on the MS2-only scan which was 
      implemented successively after each MS2 + MS3 scan in the same sample. For all
      regulated phosphopeptides reported by spectral counting analysis, sequence and
      phosphorylation site assignments were validated by a MS2 + MS3 data-dependent
      neutral loss method. With this approach, we identified over 70 phosphorylated
      sites on 27 phosphoproteins as being differentially expressed with respect to
      tumor cell phenotype. The altered expression levels of proteins identified by
      LC-MS/MS were validated using Western blotting. Using network pathway analysis,
      we observed that the majority of the differentially expressed proteins were
      highly interconnected and belong to two major intracellular signaling pathways.
      Our findings suggest that the phosphorylation of isoform A of lamin A/C and
      GTPase activating protein binding protein 1 is associated with metastatic
      propensity. The study demonstrates a quantitative and comparative proteomics
      strategy to identify differential phosphorylation patterns in complex biological 
      samples.

TI  - An Integrated Phosphoproteomics Work Flow Reveals Extensive Network Regulation in
      Early Lysophosphatidic Acid Signaling*.
PG  - 1047-62
AB  - Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induces a variety of cellular signaling pathways
      through the activation of its cognate G protein-coupled receptors. To investigate
      early LPA responses and assess the contribution of epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
      receptor transactivation in LPA signaling, we performed phosphoproteomics
      analyses of both total cell lysate and protein kinase-enriched fractions as
      complementary strategies to monitor phosphorylation changes in A498 kidney
      carcinoma cells. Our integrated work flow enabled the identification and
      quantification of more than 5,300 phosphorylation sites of which 224 were
      consistently regulated by LPA. In addition to induced phosphorylation events, we 
      also obtained evidence for early dephosphorylation reactions due to rapid
      phosphatase regulation upon LPA treatment. Phosphorylation changes induced by
      direct heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor-mediated EGF receptor activation
      were typically weaker and only detected on a subset of LPA-regulated sites,
      indicating signal integration among EGF receptor transactivation and other
      LPA-triggered pathways. Our results reveal rapid phosphoregulation of many
      proteins not yet implicated in G protein-coupled receptor signaling and point to 
      various additional mechanisms by which LPA might regulate cell survival and
      migration as well as gene transcription on the molecular level. Moreover, our
      phosphoproteomics analysis of both total lysate and kinase-enriched fractions
      provided highly complementary parts of the LPA-regulated signaling network and
      thus represents a useful and generic strategy toward comprehensive signaling
      studies on a system-wide level.

TI  - A Ras signaling complex controls the RasC-TORC2 pathway and directed cell
      migration.
PG  - 737-49
AB  - Ras was found to regulate Dictyostelium chemotaxis, but the mechanisms that
      spatially and temporally control Ras activity during chemotaxis remain largely
      unknown. We report the discovery of a Ras signaling complex that includes the Ras
      guanine exchange factor (RasGEF) Aimless, RasGEFH, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A),
      and a scaffold designated Sca1. The Sca1/RasGEF/PP2A complex is recruited to the 
      plasma membrane in a chemoattractant- and F-actin-dependent manner and is
      enriched at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells where it regulates F-actin
      dynamics and signal relay by controlling the activation of RasC and the
      downstream TORC2-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway. In addition, PKB and
      PKB-related PKBR1 phosphorylate Sca1 and regulate the membrane localization of
      the Sca1/RasGEF/PP2A complex, and thereby RasC activity, in a negative feedback
      fashion. Thus, our study uncovered a molecular mechanism whereby RasC activity
      and the spatiotemporal activation of TORC2 are tightly controlled at the leading 
      edge of chemotaxing cells.

TI  - Differential Phosphoproteomics of Fibroblast Growth Factor Signaling:
      Identification of Src Family Kinase-Mediated Phosphorylation Events.
PG  - 2317-28
AB  - Activation of signal transduction by the receptor tyrosine kinase, fibroblast
      growth factor receptor (FGFR), results in a cascade of protein−protein
      interactions that rely on the occurrence of specific tyrosine phosphorylation
      events. One such protein recruited to the activated receptor complex is the
      nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src, which is involved in both initiation and
      termination of further signaling events. To gain a further understanding of the
      tyrosine phosphorylation events that occur during FGF signaling, with a specific 
      focus on those that are dependent on Src family kinase (SFK) activity, we have
      applied SILAC combined with chemical inhibition of SFK activity to search for
      phosphorylation events that are dependent on SFK activity in FGF stimulated
      cells. In addition, we used a more targeted approach to carry out high coverage
      phosphopeptide mapping of one Src substrate protein, the multifunctional adaptor 
      Dok1, and to identify SFK-dependent Dok1 binding partners. From these analyses we
      identify 80 SFK-dependent phosphorylation events on 40 proteins. We further
      identify 18 SFK-dependent Dok1 interactions and 9 SFK-dependent Dok1
      phosphorylation sites, 6 of which had not previously been known to be
      SFK-dependent.

TI  - Systems approaches to polypharmacology and drug discovery.
PG  - 297-309
AB  - Systems biology uses experimental and computational approaches to characterize
      large sample populations systematically, process large datasets, examine and
      analyze regulatory networks, and model reactions to determine how components are 
      joined to form functional systems. Systems biology technologies, data and
      knowledge are particularly useful in understanding disease processes and drug
      actions. An important area of integration between systems biology and drug
      discovery is the concept of polypharmacology: the treatment of diseases by
      modulating more than one target. Polypharmacology for complex diseases is likely 
      to involve multiple drugs acting on distinct targets that are part of a network
      regulating physiological responses. This review discusses the current state of
      the systems-level understanding of diseases and both the therapeutic and adverse 
      mechanisms of drug actions. Drug-target networks can be used to identify multiple
      targets and to determine suitable combinations of drug targets or drugs. Thus,
      the discovery of new drug therapies for complex diseases may be greatly aided by 
      systems biology.

      cancer.
PG  - 291-9
AB  - We describe a strategy to comprehend signaling pathways active in lung cancer
      cells and targeted by dasatinib employing chemical proteomics to identify direct 
      interacting proteins combined with immunoaffinity purification of tyrosine
      phosphorylated peptides corresponding to activated tyrosine kinases. We
      identified nearly 40 different kinase targets of dasatinib. These include SFK
      members (LYN, SRC, FYN, LCK, YES), non-receptor tyrosine kinases (FRK, BRK, ACK),
      and receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephrin receptors, DDR1, EGFR). Using quantitative 
      phosphoproteomics we identified peptides corresponding to autophosphorylation
      sites of these tyrosine kinases that are inhibited in a concentration-dependent
      manner by dasatinib. Using drug resistant gatekeeper mutants, we show that SFK
      kinases, particularly SRC and FYN, as well as EGFR are relevant targets for
      dasatinib action. The combined mass spectrometry based approach described here
      provides a system-level view of dasatinib action in cancer cells and suggests
      both functional targets and rationale combinatorial therapeutic strategies.

PG  - 1-14
AB  - Stem cell research has been widely studied over the last few years and has
      attracted increasing attention from researchers in all fields of medicine due to 
      its potential to treat many previously incurable diseases by replacing damaged
      cells or tissues. As illustrated by hematopoietic stem research, understanding
      stem cell differentiation at molecular levels is essential for both basic
      research and for clinical applications of stem cells. Although multiple
      integrative analyses, such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics and
      proteomics, are required to understand stem cell biology, proteomics has a unique
      position in stem cell research. For example, several major breakthroughs in HSC
      research were due to the identification of proteins such as colony-stimulating
      factors (CSFs) and cell-surface CD molecules. In 2007, the Human Proteome
      Organization (HUPO) and the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) 
      launched the joint Proteome Biology of Stem Cells Initiative. A systematic
      proteomics approach to understanding stem cell differentiation will shed new
      light on stem cell biology and accelerate clinical applications of stem cells.

TI  - mTOR Signaling in Lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
PG  - 33-42
AB  - The protein mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a central role in cell
      growth and proliferation. Excessive mTOR activity is a prominent feature of many 
      neoplasms and hamartoma syndromes, including lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a
      destructive lung disease that causes progressive respiratory failure in women.
      Although pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR should directly target the
      pathogenesis of these disorders, their clinical efficacy has been suboptimal.
      Recent scientific findings reviewed here have greatly improved our understanding

AB  - The Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands have intriguing
      expression patterns in cancer cells and tumor blood vessels, which suggest
      important roles for their bidirectional signals in multiple aspects of cancer
      development and progression. Eph gene mutations likely also contribute to cancer 
      pathogenesis. Eph receptors and ephrins have been shown to affect the growth and 
      migration/invasion of cancer cells in culture as well as tumor growth,
      invasiveness, angiogenesis, and metastasis in vivo. However, Eph signaling
      activities in cancer appear to be complex, and are characterized by puzzling
      dichotomies. The Eph receptors nevertheless represent promising new therapeutic
      targets in cancer.

TI  - Novel Ser/Thr Protein Phosphatase 5 (PP5) Regulated Targets during DNA Damage
      Identified by Proteomics Analysis.
PG  - 945
AB  - The DNA damage response is a global phosphorylation signaling cascade process
      involved in sensing the damaged DNA condition and coordinating responses to cope 
      with and repair the perturbed cellular state. We utilized a label-free liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry approach to evaluate changes in protein
      phosphorylation associated with PP5 activity during the DNA damage response.
      Biological replicate analyses of bleomycin-treated HeLa cells expressing either
      WT-PP5 or mutant inactive PP5 lead to the identification of six potential target 
      proteins of PP5 action. Four of these putative targets are known to be involved
      in DNA damage responses. Using phospho-site specific antibodies, we confirmed
      that phosphorylation of one target, ribosomal protein S6, was selectively
      decreased in cells overexpressing catalytically inactive PP5. Our findings also
      suggest that PP5 may play a role in controlling translation and in regulating
      substrates for proline-directed kinases, such as MAP kinases and cyclin-dependent
      protein kinases that are involved in response to DNA damage.

TI  - Phosphoproteomic Profiling Reveals Vasopressin-Regulated Phosphorylation Sites in
      Collecting Duct.
PG  - 303-15
AB  - Protein phosphorylation is an important component of vasopressin signaling in the
      renal collecting duct, but the database of known phosphoproteins is incomplete.
      We used tandem mass spectrometry to identify vasopressin-regulated
      phosphorylation events in isolated rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD)
      suspensions. Using multiple search algorithms to identify the phosphopeptides
      from spectral data, we expanded the size of the existing collecting duct
      phosphoproteome database from 367 to 1187 entries. Label-free quantification in
      vasopressin- and vehicle-treated samples detected a significant change in the
      phosphorylation of 29 of 530 quantified phosphopeptides. The targets include
      important structural, regulatory, and transporter proteins. The
      vasopressin-regulated sites included two known sites (Ser-486 and Ser-499)
      present in the urea channel UT-A1 and one previously unknown site (Ser-84) on
      vasopressin-sensitive urea channels UT-A1 and UT-A3. In vitro assays using
      synthetic peptides showed that purified protein kinase A (PKA) could
      phosphorylate all three sites, and immunoblotting confirmed the PKA dependence of
      Ser-84 and Ser-486 phosphorylation. These results expand the known list of
      collecting duct phosphoproteins and highlight the utility of targeted
      phosphoproteomic approaches.

TI  - Proteomic profiling of nuclei from native renal inner medullary collecting duct
      cells using LC-MS/MS.
PG  - 167-83
AB  - Vasopressin is a peptide hormone that regulates renal water excretion in part
      through its actions on the collecting duct. The regulation occurs in part via
      control of transcription of genes coding for the water channels aquaporin-2
      (Aqp2) and aquaporin-3 (Aqp3). To identify transcription factors expressed in
      collecting duct cells, we have carried out LC-MS/MS-based proteomic profiling of 
      nuclei isolated from native rat inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs). To
      maximize the number of proteins identified, we matched spectra to rat amino acid 
      sequences using three different search algorithms (SEQUEST, InsPecT, and OMSSA). 
      All searches were coupled to target-decoy methodology to limit false-discovery
      identifications to 2% of the total for single-peptide identifications. In
      addition, we developed a computational tool (ProMatch) to identify and eliminate 
      ambiguous identifications. With this approach, we identified >3,500 proteins,
      including 154 proteins classified as “transcription factor” proteins (Panther
      Classification System). Among these, are members of CREB, ETS, RXR, NFAT, HOX,
      GATA, EBOX, EGR, MYT1, KLF, and CP2 families, which were found to have
      evolutionarily conserved putative binding sites in the 5′-flanking region or
      first intron of the Aqp2 gene, as well as members of EBOX, NR2, GRE, MAZ, KLF,
      and SP1 families corresponding to conserved sites in the 5′-flanking region of
      the Aqp3 gene. In addition, several novel phosphorylation sites in nuclear
      proteins were identified using the neutral loss-scanning LC-MS3 technique. The
      newly identified proteins have been incorporated into the IMCD Proteome Database 
      (http://dir.nhlbi.nih.gov/papers/lkem/imcd/).

AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful method to unravel the role of a given gene 
      in eukaryotic cells. The development of high throughput assay platforms such as
      fluorescence plate readers and high throughput microscopy has allowed the design 
      of genome wide RNAi screens to systemically discern members of regulatory
      networks around various cellular processes. Here we summarize the different
      strategies employed in RNAi screens to reveal regulators of transcriptional
      networks. We focus our discussion in experimental approaches designed to uncover 
      regulatory interactions modulating transcription factor activity.

TI  - SHIP2, a factor associated with diet-induced obesity and insulin sensitivity,
      attenuates FGF signaling in vivo.
PG  - 733-42
AB  - SH2-domain-containing inositol phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) belongs to a small family of
      phosphoinositide 5-phosphatases that help terminate intracellular signaling
      initiated by activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Mammalian SHIP2 is viewed
      primarily as an attenuator of insulin signaling and has become a prominent
      candidate target for therapeutic agents that are designed to augment insulin
      signaling. Despite this view, no signaling pathway has yet been demonstrated as
      being affected directly by SHIP2 function in vivo, and in vitro studies indicate 
      that the protein may function in multiple signaling pathways. Here, we analyze
      the role of a SHIP2 family member in the early zebrafish embryo where
      developmental and gene expression defects can be used to assay specific signaling
      pathways. The zebrafish ship2a transcript is maternally supplied, and inhibiting 
      the expression of its protein product results in the expansion of dorsal tissue
      fates at the expense of ventral ones. We show that the developmental defects are 
      the result of perturbation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in the
      early embryo. Loss of Ship2a leads to an increased and expanded expression of
      outputs of FGF-mediated signaling, including FGF-dependent gene expression and
      activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Our findings
      demonstrate that Ship2a attenuates the FGF signaling pathway in vivo and
      functions in the establishment of normal tissue patterning in the early embryo.
      We suggest that modulation of FGF signaling may be a principal function of SHIP2 
      in mammals.

TI  - Targeting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer:
      Current Knowledge and Future Challenges.
LID - 568938
AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor is overexpressed in up to 60% of ovarian
      epithelial malignancies. EGFR regulates complex cellular events due to the large 
      number of ligands, dimerization partners, and diverse signaling pathways engaged.
      In ovarian cancer, EGFR activation is associated with increased malignant tumor
      phenotype and poorer patient outcome. However, unlike some other EGFR-positive
      solid tumors, treatment of ovarian tumors with anti-EGFR agents has induced
      minimal response. While the amount of information regarding EGFR-mediated
      signaling is considerable, current data provides little insight for the lack of
      efficacy of anti-EGFR agents in ovarian cancer. More comprehensive, systematic,
      and well-defined approaches are needed to dissect the roles that EGFR plays in
      the complex signaling processes in ovarian cancer as well as to identify
      biomarkers that can accurately predict sensitivity toward EGFR-targeted
      therapeutic agents. This new knowledge could facilitate the development of
      rational combinatorial therapies to sensitize tumor cells toward EGFR-targeted
      therapies.

      regulatory networks. We describe the integration of these analyses with
      pharmacology, which leads to new understanding of drug action and enables drug
      discovery for complex diseases. Network studies of drug-target relationships can

      drug-discovery progress. There is a growing number of targeted therapies approved
      and in the pipeline, which meets a new set of problems with efficacy and adverse 
      effects. The pitfalls of these mechanistically based drugs are described, along
      with how a systems view of drug action is increasingly important to uncover
      intricate signaling mechanisms that play an important part in drug action,
      resistance mechanisms, and off-target effects. Computational methodologies enable
      the classification of drugs according to their structures and to which proteins
      they bind. Recent studies have combined the structural analyses with analysis of 
      regulatory networks to make predictions about the therapeutic effects of drugs

TI  - Phosphorylation of nucleoporins: Signal transduction-mediated regulation of their
      interaction with nuclear transport receptors.
PG  - 309-13
AB  - The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is composed of ∼30 unique proteins, collectively
      referred to as nucleoporins or Nups. While metazoan Nups are known to be
      phosphorylated during mitosis to cause disassembly of the NPC, what is less clear
      is whether Nups are phosphorylated and regulated by extracellular stimuli in
      interphase cells. Our multi-step phosphoproteomic approach revealed a number of
      physiologically relevant extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) targets,
      including Nups containing FG repeats (FG Nups) that provide binding sites for
      nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) during the NPC passage. The phosphorylation of
      FG Nups by ERK does not affect the overall architecture of the NPC but directly
      inhibits their interactions with NTRs and regulates the permeability barrier
      properties of the NPC. Such regulation at the levels of transport machinery is
      expected to have a broad impact on cellular physiology through the spatiotemporal
      control of signaling events. Until recently, many studies have focused on
      cellular signaling-mediated phosphorylation of individual cargo proteins, such as
      transcription factors. An understanding of the effects of signaling pathways on
      nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery is only beginning to emerge.

      nucleus. The material which translocates through nuclear pores is diverse; it
      includes numerous proteins, RNAs and large ribonucleoprotein complexes like
      ribosomal subunits. To ensure the correct nucleocytoplasmic distribution of these
      components, appropriate mechanisms have to be in place which control traffic
      across the nuclear envelope. A growing number of studies support the notion that 
      transport through nuclear pore complexes is intimately linked to cell physiology.
      As such, it has become evident that changes in the cellular environment, either
      by externally applied stress, aging or disease, alter nuclear traffic. Due to the
      progress made in the past few years, we are now beginning to understand these
      processes at the molecular level. Thus, the concept emerges that stress or
      disease conditions correlate with signaling events which aim at the nuclear
      transport apparatus. Here, we summarize results from recent publications that
      provide evidence for the hypothesis that changes in cell physiology modulate
      nuclear traffic by targeting multiple transport factors. We propose that this
      traffic control is at least in part mediated by specific signaling events.

TI  - The mechanism and implications of hScrib regulation of ERK.
PG  - 108-12
AB  - Scribble is a potential tumor suppressor protein, whose loss is a frequent event 
      in late stage cancer development. In both Drosophila and mammalian model systems,
      Scribble has been shown capable of regulating cell polarity, cell proliferation
      and apoptosis. Although several interacting partners, including βPiX, have been
      identified that help to explain how Scribble can regulate cell polarity and
      migration, little is known about how Scribble can control cell proliferation.
      Recent work from our laboratory has shown that Scribble can directly regulate the
      ERK signaling pathway. This is mediated by a direct protein-protein interaction
      between Scribble and ERK, which has two components. In the first, Scribble
      appears to anchor ERK at membrane-bound sites, with the loss of Scribble
      enhancing ERK nuclear translocation. In the second, Scribble can decrease the
      levels of active phosphorylated ERK, a function that is dependent upon the
      ability of Scribble to bind ERK directly. One of the consequences of this
      activity of Scribble is the inhibition of EJ-ras induced cell transformation.
      These results provide some of the first direct mechanistic information on how
      Scribble can regulate cell proliferation and, furthermore, they provide
      indications as to the identity of other signaling intermediates that may be
      recruited by Scribble to directly regulate mitogenic signaling pathways.

TI  - Computational Modeling of Mammalian Signaling Networks.
PG  - 194-209
AB  - One of the most exciting developments in signal transduction research has been
      the proliferation of studies in which a biological discovery was initiated by
      computational modeling. Here we review the major efforts that enable such
      studies. First, we describe the experimental technologies that are generally used
      to identify the molecular components and interactions in, and dynamic behavior
      exhibited by, a network of interest. Next, we review the mathematical approaches 
      that are used to model signaling network behavior. Finally, we focus on three
      specific instances of “model-driven discovery”: cases in which computational
      modeling of a signaling network has led to new insights which have been verified 
      experimentally.Signal transduction networks are the bridge between the
      extraordinarily complex extracellular environment and a carefully orchestrated
      cellular response. These networks are largely composed of proteins which can
      interact, move to specific cellular locations, or be modified or degraded. The
      integration of these events often leads to the activation or inactivation of
      transcription factors, which then induce or repress the expression of thousands
      of genes.Because of this critical role in translating environmental cues to
      cellular behaviors, malfunctioning signaling networks can lead to a variety of
      pathologies. One example is cancer, in which many of the key genes found to be
      involved in cancer onset and development are components of signaling pathways [1,
      2]. A detailed understanding of the cellular signaling networks underlying such
      diseases would likely be extremely useful in developing new treatments.However,
      the complexity of signaling networks is such that their integrated functions
      cannot be determined without computational simulation. In recent years,
      mathematical modeling of signal transduction has led to some exciting new
      findings and biological discoveries. Here, we review the work that has enabled
      computational modeling of mammalian signaling networks, as well as the
      demonstrated value of such modeling. We begin by reviewing the experimental
      techniques commonly associated with model-building efforts, in terms of mapping
      network interactions as well as determining the dynamic network response to
      perturbation. We then discuss modeling strategies, and finally focus on three
      cases that dramatically illustrate the power of models to discover new biology.

AB  - Recent efforts in systematically profiling embryonic stem (ES) cells have yielded
      a wealth of high-throughput data. Complementarily, emerging databases and
      computational tools facilitate ES cell studies and further pave the way toward
      the in silico reconstruction of regulatory networks encompassing multiple
      molecular layers. Here, we briefly survey databases, algorithms, and software
      tools used to organize and analyze high-throughput experimental data collected to
      study mammalian cellular systems with a focus on ES cells. The vision of using
      heterogeneous data to reconstruct a complete multilayered ES cell regulatory
      network is discussed. This review also provides an accompanying manually
      extracted dataset of different types of regulatory interactions from
      low-throughput experimental ES cell studies available at

AB  - In order to understand how a cancer cell is functionally different from a normal 
      cell it is necessary to assess the complex network of pathways involving gene
      regulation, signaling, and cell metabolism, and the alterations in its dynamics
      caused by the several different types of mutations leading to malignancy. Since
      the network is typically complex, with multiple connections between pathways and 
      important feedback loops, it is crucial to represent it in the form of a
      computational model that can be used for a rigorous analysis. This is the
      approach of systems biology, made possible by new –omics data generation
      technologies. The goal of this review is to illustrate this approach and its
      utility for our understanding of cancer. After a discussion of recent progress
      using a network-centric approach, three case studies related to diagnostics,
      therapy, and drug development are presented in detail. They focus on breast
      cancer, B cell lymphomas, and colorectal cancer. The discussion is centered on
      key mathematical and computational tools common to a systems biology approach.

TI  - Concurrent Quantification of Proteome and Phosphoproteome to Reveal System-wide
      Association of Protein Phosphorylation and Gene Expression*.
PG  - 2809-26
AB  - Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is an important process modulating
      cellular activities from upstream, which mainly involves sequential
      phosphorylation of signaling molecules, to downstream where phosphorylation of
      transcription factors regulates gene expression. In this study, we combined
      quantitative labeling with multidimensional liquid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry to monitor the proteome and phosphoproteome changes in the initial
      period of adipocyte differentiation. The phosphorylation level of a specific
      protein may be regulated by a kinase or phosphatase without involvement of gene
      expression or as a phenomenon that accompanies the alteration of its gene
      expression. Concurrent quantification of phosphopeptides and non-phosphorylated
      peptides makes it possible to differentiate cellular phosphorylation changes at
      these two levels. Furthermore, on the system level, certain proteins were
      predicted as the targeted gene products regulated by identified transcription
      factors. Among them, several proteins showed significant expression changes along
      with the phosphorylation alteration of their transcription factors. This is to
      date the first work to concurrently quantify proteome and phosphoproteome changes
      during the initial period of adipocyte differentiation, providing an approach to 
      reveal the system-wide association of protein phosphorylation and gene
      expression.

TI  - O-Linked N-Acetylglucosamine Modification of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 Occurs 
      in Close Proximity to Multiple SH2 Domain Binding Motifs*.
PG  - 2733-45
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a highly phosphorylated adaptor protein
      critical to insulin and IGF-1 receptor signaling. Ser/Thr kinases impact the
      metabolic and mitogenic effects elicited by insulin and IGF-1 through feedback
      and feed forward regulation at the level of IRS-1. Ser/Thr residues of IRS-1 are 
      also O-GlcNAc-modified, which may influence the phosphorylation status of the
      protein. To facilitate the understanding of the functional effects of O-GlcNAc
      modification on IRS-1-mediated signaling, we identified the sites of O-GlcNAc
      modification of rat and human IRS-1. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of IRS-1,
      exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells, revealed that the C terminus, which is
      rich in docking sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, was O-GlcNAc-modified
      at multiple residues. Rat IRS-1 was O-GlcNAc-modified at Ser914, Ser1009,
      Ser1036, and Ser1041. Human IRS-1 was O-GlcNAc-modified at Ser984 or Ser985, at
      Ser1011, and possibly at multiple sites within residues 1025–1045. O-GlcNAc
      modification at a conserved residue in rat (Ser1009) and human (Ser1011) IRS-1 is
      adjacent to a putative binding motif for the N-terminal SH2 domains of p85α and
      p85β regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the tyrosine
      phosphatase SHP2 (PTPN11). Immunoblot analysis using an antibody generated
      against human IRS-1 Ser1011 GlcNAc further confirmed the site of attachment and
      the identity of the +203.2-Da mass shift as β-N-acetylglucosamine. The
      accumulation of IRS-1 Ser1011 GlcNAc in HEPG2 liver cells and MC3T3-E1
      preosteoblasts upon inhibition of O-GlcNAcase indicates that O-GlcNAcylation of
      endogenously expressed IRS-1 is a dynamic process that occurs at normal glucose
      concentrations (5 mm). O-GlcNAc modification did not occur at any known or newly 
      identified Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites and in most cases occurred
      simultaneously with phosphorylation of nearby residues. These findings suggest
      that O-GlcNAc modification represents an additional layer of posttranslational
      regulation that may impact the specificity of effects elicited by insulin and
      IGF-1.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphokinome Analysis of the Met Pathway Activated by the Invasin
      Internalin B from Listeria monocytogenes*.
PG  - 2778-95
AB  - Stimulated by its physiological ligand, hepatocyte growth factor, the
      transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase Met activates a signaling machinery that
      leads to mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic responses. Remarkably, the
      food-borne human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes also promotes
      autophosphorylation of Met through its virulence factor internalin B (InlB) and
      subsequently exploits Met signaling to induce phagocytosis into a broad range of 
      host cells. Although the interaction between InlB and Met has been studied in
      detail, the signaling specificity of components involved in InlB-triggered
      cellular responses remains poorly characterized. The analysis of regulated
      phosphorylation events on protein kinases is therefore of particular relevance,
      although this could not as yet be characterized systematically by proteomics.
      Here, we implemented a new pyridopyrimidine-based strategy that enabled the
      efficient capture of a considerable subset of the human kinome in a robust
      one-step affinity chromatographic procedure. Additionally, and to gain functional
      insights into the InlB/Met-induced bacterial invasion process, a quantitative
      survey of the phosphorylation pattern of these protein kinases was accomplished. 
      In total, the experimental design of this study comprises affinity
      chromatographic procedures for the systematic enrichment of kinases, as well as
      phosphopeptides; the quantification of all peptides based on the iTRAQTM reporter
      system; and a rational statistical strategy to evaluate the quality of
      phosphosite regulations. With this improved chemical proteomics strategy, we
      determined and relatively quantified 143 phosphorylation sites detected on 94
      human protein kinases. Interestingly, InlB-mediated signaling shows striking
      similarities compared with the natural ligand hepatocyte growth factor that was
      intensively studied in the past. In addition, this systematic approach suggests a
      new subset of protein kinases including Nek9, which are differentially
      phosphorylated after short time (4-min) treatment of cells with the
      Met-activating InlB321. Thus, this quantitative phosphokinome study suggests a
      general, hypothesis-free concept for the detection of dynamically regulated
      protein kinases as novel signaling components involved in host-pathogen
      interactions.

TI  - Identification of c-Src Tyrosine Kinase Substrates in Platelet-Derived Growth
      Factor Receptor Signaling.
PG  - 439-50
AB  - c-Src non-receptor tyrosine kinase is an important component of the
      platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signaling pathway. c-Src has been 
      shown to mediate the mitogenic response to PDGF in fibroblasts. However, the
      exact components of PDGF receptor signaling pathway mediated by c-Src remain
      unclear. Here, we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture
      (SILAC) coupled with mass spectrometry to identify Src family kinase substrates
      involved in PDGF signaling. Using SILAC, we were able to detect changes in
      tyrosine phosphorylation patterns of 43 potential c-Src kinase substrates in PDGF
      receptor signaling. This included 23 known c-Src kinase substrates, of which 16
      proteins have known roles in PDGF signaling while the remaining 7 proteins have
      not previously been implicated in PDGF receptor signaling. Importantly, our
      analysis also led to identification of 20 novel Src family kinase substrates, of 
      which 5 proteins were previously reported as PDGF receptor signaling pathway
      intermediates while the remaining 15 proteins represent novel signaling
      intermediates in PDGF receptor signaling. In validation experiments, we
      demonstrated that PDGF indeed induced the phosphorylation of a subset of
      candidate Src family kinase substrates – Calpain 2, Eps15 and Trim28 – in a
      c-Src-dependent fashion.

TI  - Identifying Drug Effects via Pathway Alterations using an Integer Linear
      Programming Optimization Formulation on Phosphoproteomic Data.
LID - e1000591
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of cell function and drug action is a major endeavor
      in the pharmaceutical industry. Drug effects are governed by the intrinsic
      properties of the drug (i.e., selectivity and potency) and the specific signaling
      transduction network of the host (i.e., normal vs. diseased cells). Here, we
      describe an unbiased, phosphoproteomic-based approach to identify drug effects by
      monitoring drug-induced topology alterations. With our proposed method, drug
      effects are investigated under diverse stimulations of the signaling network.
      Starting with a generic pathway made of logical gates, we build a cell-type
      specific map by constraining it to fit 13 key phopshoprotein signals under 55
      experimental conditions. Fitting is performed via an Integer Linear Program (ILP)
      formulation and solution by standard ILP solvers; a procedure that drastically
      outperforms previous fitting schemes. Then, knowing the cell's topology, we
      monitor the same key phosphoprotein signals under the presence of drug and we
      re-optimize the specific map to reveal drug-induced topology alterations. To
      prove our case, we make a topology for the hepatocytic cell-line HepG2 and we
      evaluate the effects of 4 drugs: 3 selective inhibitors for the Epidermal Growth 
      Factor Receptor (EGFR) and a non-selective drug. We confirm effects easily
      predictable from the drugs' main target (i.e., EGFR inhibitors blocks the EGFR
      pathway) but we also uncover unanticipated effects due to either drug promiscuity
      or the cell's specific topology. An interesting finding is that the selective
      EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib inhibits signaling downstream the Interleukin-1alpha
      (IL1α) pathway; an effect that cannot be extracted from binding affinity-based
      approaches. Our method represents an unbiased approach to identify drug effects
      on small to medium size pathways which is scalable to larger topologies with any 
      type of signaling interventions (small molecules, RNAi, etc). The method can
      reveal drug effects on pathways, the cornerstone for identifying mechanisms of
      drug's efficacy.

TI  - Sensing the Insulin Signaling Pathway with an Antibody Array.
PG  - 1440-50
AB  - The development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes is determined by
      various factors, including defects within the insulin signaling pathway.
      Mediators of insulin resistance operate through activation of various protein
      kinase C (PKC) isoforms, IκB kinase β (IKKβ) and/or c-Jun N-terminal kinase
      (JNK), and subsequent inhibition of the proximal insulin signaling pathway via
      the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and Akt. These mechanisms are still
      largely unresolved because of the complexity of the molecular events. In this
      study, an expression and activation state profiling of multiple known key
      signaling biomolecules involved in insulin metabolic and mitogenic signaling
      pathways was evaluated using a phosphospecific antibody array platform. The
      results of the arrayed antibodies were verified by the multiplexed bead array
      assay and conventional western blot analysis, and confirmed the well-known
      inhibitory effects of phorbol esters on insulin signaling pathway activation. Of 
      interest, the increase in PKC signaling responses with phorbol esters was
      associated with activation of the lipid phosphatase PTEN and a 27 kDa heat shock 
      protein. Thus, this insulin signaling antibody array provides a powerful and
      effective way to investigate the mechanism of insulin resistance and likely
      assist the development of innovative therapeutic drugs for type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Multiple myeloma phosphotyrosine proteomic profile associated with FGFR3
      expression, ligand activation, and drug inhibition.
PG  - 20127-32
AB  - Signaling by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases is manifest through networks
      of proteins that are substrates and/or bind to the activated receptors. FGF
      receptor-3 (FGFR3) is a drug target in a subset of human multiple myelomas (MM)
      and is mutationally activated in some cervical and colon and many bladder cancers
      and in certain skeletal dysplasias. To define the FGFR3 network in multiple
      myeloma, mass spectrometry was used to identify and quantify phosphotyrosine (pY)
      sites modulated by FGFR3 activation and inhibition in myeloma-derived KMS11
      cells. Label-free quantification of peptide ion currents indicated the activation
      of FGFR3 by phosphorylation of tandem tyrosines in the kinase domain activation
      loop when cellular pY phosphatases were inhibited by pervanadate. Among the 175
      proteins that accumulated pY in response to pervanadate was a subset of 52
      including FGFR3 that contained a total of 61 pY sites that were sensitive to
      inhibition by the FGFR3 inhibitor PD173074. The FGFR3 isoform containing the
      tandem pY motif in its activation loop was targeted by PD173074. Forty of the
      drug-sensitive pY sites, including two located within the 35-residue cytoplasmic 
      domain of the transmembrane growth factor binding proteoglycan (and multiple
      myeloma biomarker) Syndecan-1/CD138, were also stimulated in cells treated with
      the ligand FGF1, providing additional validation of their link to FGFR3. The
      identification of these overlapping sets of co-modulated tyrosine
      phosphorylations presents an outline of an FGFR3 network in the MM model and
      demonstrates the potential for pharmacodynamic monitoring by label-free
      quantitative phospho-proteomics.

TI  - In vivo Phosphoproteome of Human Skeletal Muscle Revealed by Phosphopeptide
      Enrichment and HPLC-ESI-MS/MS.
PG  - 4954-65
AB  - Protein phosphorylation plays an essential role in signal transduction pathways
      that regulate substrate and energy metabolism, contractile function, and muscle
      mass in human skeletal muscle. Abnormal phosphorylation of signaling enzymes has 
      been identified in insulin resistant muscle using phosphoepitope-specific
      antibodies, but its role in other skeletal muscle disorders remains largely
      unknown. This may be in part due to insufficient knowledge of relevant targets.
      Here, we therefore present the first large-scale in vivo phosphoproteomic study
      of human skeletal muscle from 3 lean, healthy volunteers. Trypsin digestion of
      3-5 mg human skeletal muscle protein was followed by phosphopeptide enrichment
      using SCX and TiO2. The resulting phosphopeptides were analyzed by
      HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Using this unbiased approach, we identified 306 distinct in vivo 
      phosphorylation sites in 127 proteins, including 240 phosphoserines, 53
      phosphothreonines and 13 phosphotyrosines in at least 2 out of 3 subjects. In
      addition, 61 ambiguous phosphorylation sites were identified in at least 2 out of
      3 subjects. The majority of phosphoproteins detected are involved in sarcomeric
      function, excitation-contraction coupling (the Ca2+-cycle), glycolysis and
      glycogen metabolism. Of particular interest, we identified multiple novel
      phosphorylation sites on several sarcomeric Z-disc proteins known to be involved 
      in signaling and muscle disorders. These results provide numerous new targets for
      the investigation of human skeletal muscle phosphoproteins in health and disease 
      and demonstrate feasibility of phosphoproteomics research of human skeletal
      muscle in vivo.

TI  - Differential 14-3-3 Affinity Capture Reveals New Downstream Targets of
      Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling*.
PG  - 2487-99
AB  - We devised a strategy of 14-3-3 affinity capture and release, isotope
      differential (d0/d4) dimethyl labeling of tryptic digests, and phosphopeptide
      characterization to identify novel targets of insulin/IGF1/phosphatidylinositol
      3-kinase signaling. Notably four known insulin-regulated proteins (PFK-2, PRAS40,
      AS160, and MYO1C) had high d0/d4 values meaning that they were more highly
      represented among 14-3-3-binding proteins from insulin-stimulated than
      unstimulated cells. Among novel candidates, insulin receptor substrate 2, the
      proapoptotic CCDC6, E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF2, and signaling adapter SASH1 were
      confirmed to bind to 14-3-3s in response to IGF1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      signaling. Insulin receptor substrate 2, ZNRF2, and SASH1 were also regulated by 
      phorbol ester via p90RSK, whereas CCDC6 and PRAS40 were not. In contrast, the
      actin-associated protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and
      lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor, which had low d0/d4 scores, bound
      14-3-3s irrespective of IGF1 and phorbol ester. Phosphorylated Ser19 of ZNRF2
      (RTRAYpS19GS), phospho-Ser90 of SASH1 (RKRRVpS90QD), and phospho- Ser493 of
      lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (RPRARpS493LD) provide one of the
      14-3-3-binding sites on each of these proteins. Differential 14-3-3 capture
      provides a powerful approach to defining downstream regulatory mechanisms for
      specific signaling pathways.

TI  - A New Approach for Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Dissection of Signaling Pathways
      Applied to T Cell Receptor Activation*.
PG  - 2418-31
AB  - Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in the regulation of
      cellular signaling pathways. Current approaches in phosphoproteomics focus on
      analysis of the global phosphoproteome in a single cellular state or of receptor 
      stimulation time course experiments, often with a restricted number of time
      points. Although these studies have provided some insights into newly discovered 
      phosphorylation sites that may be involved in pathways, they alone do not provide
      enough information to make precise predictions of the placement of individual
      phosphorylation events within a signaling pathway. Protein disruption and
      site-directed mutagenesis are essential to clearly define the precise biological 
      roles of the hundreds of newly discovered phosphorylation sites uncovered in
      modern proteomics experiments. We have combined genetic analysis with
      quantitative proteomic methods and recently developed visual analysis tools to
      dissect the tyrosine phosphoproteome of isogenic Zap-70 tyrosine kinase null and 
      reconstituted Jurkat T cells. In our approach, label-free quantitation using
      normalization to copurified phosphopeptide standards is applied to assemble high 
      density temporal data within a single cell type, either Zap-70 null or
      reconstituted cells, providing a list of candidate phosphorylation sites that
      change in abundance after T cell stimulation. Stable isotopic labeling of amino
      acids in cell culture (SILAC) ratios are then used to compare Zap-70 null and
      reconstituted cells across a time course of receptor stimulation, providing
      direct information about the placement of newly observed phosphorylation sites
      relative to Zap-70. These methods are adaptable to any cell culture signaling
      system in which isogenic wild type and mutant cells have been or can be derived
      using any available phosphopeptide enrichment strategy.

TI  - Comparison of Global versus Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Pathway Profiling
      for Prediction of Lapatinib Sensitivity in Bladder Cancer12.
PG  - 1185-93
AB  - Chemotherapy for metastatic bladder cancer is rarely curative. The recently
      developed small molecule, lapatinib, a dual epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 receptor tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor, might improve this situation. Recent findings suggest that identifying
      which patients are likely to benefit from targeted therapies is beneficial,
      although controversy remains regarding what types of evaluation might yield
      optimal candidate biomarkers of sensitivity. Here, we address this issue by
      developing and comparing lapatinib sensitivity prediction models for human
      bladder cancer cells. After empirically determining in vitro sensitivities (drug 
      concentration necessary to cause a 50% growth inhibition) of a panel of 39 such
      lines to lapatinib treatment, we developed prediction models based on profiling
      the baseline transcriptome, the phosphorylation status of EGFR pathway signaling 
      targets, or a combination of both data sets. We observed that models derived from
      microarray gene expression data showed better prediction performance (93%–98%
      accuracy) compared with models derived from EGFR pathway profiling of 23 selected
      phosphoproteins known to be involved in EGFR-driven signaling (54%–61% accuracy) 
      or from a subset of the microarray data for transcripts in the EGFR pathway (86% 
      accuracy). Combining microarray data and phosphoprotein profiling provided a
      combination model with 98% accuracy. Our findings suggest that transcriptome-wide
      profiling for biomarkers of lapatinib sensitivity in cancer cells provides models
      with excellent predictive performance and may be effectively combined with EGFR
      pathway phosphoprotein profiling data. These results have significant
      implications for the use of such tools in personalizing the approach to cancers
      treated with EGFR-directed targeted therapies.

TI  - Protein Kinase CK2 Regulates Cytoskeletal Reorganization during Ionizing
      Radiation-Induced Senescence of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells.
PG  - 8200-7
AB  - Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) are critical for tissue regeneration. How
      hMSC respond to genotoxic stresses and potentially contribute to aging and cancer
      remain underexplored. We demonstrated that ionizing radiation induced cellular
      senescence of hMSC over a period of 10 days, showing a critical transition
      between day 3 and day 6. This was confirmed by senescence-associated
      beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, protein expression profiles of key cell
      cycle regulators (retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, p53, p21waf1/Cip1, and p16INK4A), 
      and senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) (IL-8, IL-12, GRO, and
      MDC). We observed dramatic cytoskeletal reorganization of hMSC through reduction 
      of myosin-10, redistribution of myosin-9, and secretion of profilin-1. Using a
      SILAC-based phosphoproteomics method, we detected significant reduction of
      myosin-9 phosphorylation at Ser1943, coinciding with its redistribution.
      Importantly, through treatment with cell permeable inhibitors
      ((4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole (TBB) and
      2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT)), and gene knockdown
      using RNA interference, we identified CK2, a kinase responsible for myosin-9
      phosphorylation at Ser1943, as a key factor contributing to the radiation-induced
      senescence of hMSC. We showed that individual knockdown of CK2 catalytic subunits
      CK2α and CK2α′ induced hMSC senescence. However, only knockdown of CK2α resulted 
      in morphological phenotypes resembling those of radiation-induced senescence.
      These results suggest that CK2α and CK2α′ play differential roles in hMSC
      senescence progression, and their relative expression might represent a novel
      regulatory mechanism for CK2 activity.

PG  - 933-40
AB  - Constitutive activation of one or more kinase signaling pathways is a hallmark of
      many cancers. Here we extend the previously described mass spectrometry–based
      KAYAK approach by monitoring kinase activities from multiple signaling pathways
      simultaneously. This improved single-reaction strategy, which quantifies the
      phosphorylation of 90 synthetic peptides in a single mass spectrometry run, is
      compatible with nanogram to microgram amounts of cell lysate. Furthermore, the
      approach enhances kinase monospecificity through substrate competition effects,
      faithfully reporting the signatures of many signaling pathways after mitogen
      stimulation or of basal pathway activation differences across a panel of
      well-studied cancer cell lines. Hierarchical clustering of activities from
      related experiments groups peptides phosphorylated by similar kinases together
      and, when combined with pathway alteration using pharmacological inhibitors,
      distinguishes underlying differences in potency, off-target effects and genetic
      backgrounds. Finally, we introduce a strategy to identify the kinase, and even
      associated protein complex members, responsible for phosphorylation events of
      interest.

TI  - Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Phosphorylation Sites Ser991 and Tyr998 Are
      Implicated in the Regulation of Receptor Endocytosis and Phosphorylations at
      Ser1039 and Thr1041*.
PG  - 2131-44
AB  - Aberrant expression, activation, and down-regulation of the epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) have causal roles in many human cancers, and
      post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and ubiquitination and
      protein-protein interactions directly modulate EGFR function. Quantitative mass
      spectrometric analyses including selected reaction monitoring (also known as
      multiple reaction monitoring) were applied to the EGFR and associated proteins.
      In response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation of cells,
      phosphorylations at EGFR Ser991 and Tyr998 accumulated more slowly than at
      receptor sites involved in RAS-ERK signaling. Phosphorylation-deficient mutant
      receptors S991A and Y998F activated ERK in response to EGF but were impaired for 
      receptor endocytosis. Consistent with these results, the mutant receptors
      retained a network of interactions with known signaling proteins including
      EGF-stimulated binding to the adaptor GRB2. Compared with wild type EGFR the
      Y998F variant had diminished EGF-stimulated interaction with the ubiquitin E3
      ligase CBL, and the S991A variant had decreased associated ubiquitin. The
      endocytosis-defective mutant receptors were found to have elevated
      phosphorylation at positions Ser1039 and Thr1041. These residues reside in a
      serine/threonine-rich region of the receptor previously implicated in p38
      mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent stress/cytokine-induced EGFR
      internalization and recycling (Zwang, Y., and Yarden, Y. (2006) p38 MAP kinase
      mediates stress-induced internalization of EGFR: implications for cancer
      chemotherapy. EMBO J. 25, 4195–4206). EGF-induced phosphorylations at Ser1039 and
      Thr1041 were blocked by treatment of cells with SB-202190, a selective inhibitor 
      of p38. These results suggest that coordinated phosphorylation of EGFR involving 
      sites Tyr998, Ser991, Ser1039, and Thr1041 governs the trafficking of EGF
      receptors. This reinforces the notion that EGFR function is manifest through
      spatially and temporally controlled protein-protein interactions and
      phosphorylations.

TI  - Characterization of the rapamycin-sensitive phosphoproteome reveals that Sch9 is 
      a central coordinator of protein synthesis.
PG  - 1929-43
AB  - The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is an essential multiprotein complex
      conserved from yeast to humans. Under favorable growth conditions, and in the
      absence of the macrolide rapamycin, TORC1 is active, and influences virtually all
      aspects of cell growth. Although two direct effectors of yeast TORC1 have been
      reported (Tap42, a regulator of PP2A phosphatases and Sch9, an AGC family
      kinase), the signaling pathways that couple TORC1 to its distal effectors were
      not well understood. To elucidate these pathways we developed and employed a
      quantitative, label-free mass spectrometry approach. Analyses of the
      rapamycin-sensitive phosphoproteomes in various genetic backgrounds revealed both
      documented and novel TORC1 effectors and allowed us to partition phosphorylation 
      events between Tap42 and Sch9. Follow-up detailed characterization shows that
      Sch9 regulates RNA polymerases I and III, the latter via Maf1, in addition to
      translation initiation and the expression of ribosomal protein and ribosome
      biogenesis genes. This demonstrates that Sch9 is a master regulator of protein
      synthesis.

TI  - An Extensive Survey of Tyrosine Phosphorylation Revealing New Sites in Human
      Mammary Epithelial Cells.
PG  - 3852-61
AB  - Protein tyrosine phosphorylation represents a central regulatory mechanism in
      cell signaling. Here we present an extensive survey of tyrosine phosphorylation
      sites in a normal-derived human mammary epithelial cell line by applying
      anti-phosphotyrosine peptide immunoaffinity purification coupled with high
      sensitivity capillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 
      481 tyrosine phosphorylation sites (covered by 716 unique peptides) from 285
      proteins were confidently identified in HMEC following the analysis of both the
      basal condition and acute stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF). The
      estimated false discovery rate was 1.0% as determined by searching against a
      scrambled database. Comparison of these data with existing literature showed
      significant agreement for previously reported sites. However, we observed 281
      sites that were not previously reported for HMEC cultures and 29 of which have
      not been reported for any human cell or tissue system. The analysis showed that
      the majority of highly phosphorylated proteins were relatively low-abundance.
      Large differences in phosphorylation stoichiometry for sites within the same
      protein were also observed, raising the possibility of more important functional 
      roles for such highly phosphorylated pTyr sites. By mapping to major signaling
      networks, such as the EGF receptor and insulin growth factor-1 receptor signaling
      pathways, many known proteins involved in these pathways were revealed to be
      tyrosine phosphorylated, which provides interesting targets for future
      hypothesis-driven and targeted quantitative studies involving tyrosine
      phosphorylation in HMEC or other human systems.

AB  - Most kinases are capable of recognizing and phosphorylating peptides containing
      short, linear sequence motifs. To measure the activation state of many kinases
      from the same cell lysate, we created a multiplexed, mass-spectrometry-based in
      vitro kinase assay. Ninety chemically synthesized peptides derived from
      well-characterized peptide substrates and in vivo phosphorylation sites with
      either known or previously unidentified upstream kinases were reacted
      individually in a plate format with crude cell lysates and ATP. Phosphorylation
      rates were directly measured based on the addition of 90 same-sequence,
      site-specific phosphopeptides enriched in stable isotopes to act as ideal
      quantitative internal standards for analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to 
      tandem mass spectrometry. This approach concurrently measured up to 90
      site-specific peptide phosphorylation rates, reporting a diagnostic fingerprint
      for activated kinase pathways. We applied this unique kinome-activity profiling
      strategy in a variety of cellular settings, including mitogen stimulation, cell
      cycle, pharmacological inhibition of pathways, and to a panel of breast cancer
      cell lines. Finally, we identified the source of activity for a peptide (derived 
      from a PI3K regulatory subunit) from our library. This peptide substrate
      demonstrated mitotic and tyrosine-specific phosphorylation, which was confirmed
      to be a novel Src family kinase site in vivo.

TI  - Quantitative Proteomics Reveals a Dynamic Interactome and Phase-specific
      Phosphorylation in the Neurospora Circadian Clock.
PG  - 354-63
AB  - Circadian systems are comprised of multiple proteins functioning together to
      produce feedback loops driving robust, approximately 24 hour rhythms. In all
      circadian systems, proteins in these loops are regulated through myriad
      physically and temporally distinct post-translational modifications (PTMs). To
      better understand how PTMs impact a circadian oscillator we implemented a
      proteomics-based approach by combining purification of endogenous FREQUENCY (FRQ)
      and its interacting partners with quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). We
      identify and quantify time-of-day specific protein-protein interactions in the
      clock and show how these provide a platform for temporal and physical separation 
      between the dual roles of FRQ. Additionally, by unambiguously identifying over 75
      phosphorylated residues, following their quantitative change over a circadian
      cycle, and examining the phenotypes of strains that have lost these sites, we
      demonstrate how spatially and temporally regulated phosphorylation has opposing
      effects directly on overt circadian rhythms and FRQ stability.

TI  - The Plasticity of Oncogene Addiction: Implications for Targeted Therapies
      Directed to Receptor Tyrosine Kinases12.
PG  - 448-58
AB  - A common mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in glioblastoma 
      multiforme (GBM) is an extracellular truncation known as the de2-7 EGFR (or
      EGFRvIII). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the ligand for the receptor tyrosine
      kinase (RTK) c-Met, and this signaling axis is often active in GBM. The
      expression of the HGF/c-Met axis or de2-7 EGFR independently enhances GBMgrowth
      and invasiveness, particularly through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/pAkt
      pathway. Using RTK arrays, we show that expression of de2-7 EGFR in U87MG GBM
      cells leads to the coactivation of several RTKs, including platelet-derived
      growth factor receptor β and c-Met. A neutralizing antibody to HGF (AMG102) did
      not inhibit de2-7 EGFR-mediated activation of c-Met, demonstrating that it is
      ligand-independent. Therapy for parental U87MG xenografts with AMG 102 resulted
      in significant inhibition of tumor growth, whereas U87MG.Δ2-7 xenografts were
      profoundly resistant. Treatment of U87MG.Δ2-7 xenografts with panitumumab, an
      anti-EGFR antibody, only partially inhibited tumor growth as xenografts rapidly
      reverted to the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway. Cotreatment with panitumumab and AMG
      102 prevented this escape leading to significant tumor inhibition through an
      apoptotic mechanism, consistent with the induction of oncogenic shock. This
      observation provides a rationale for using panitumumab and AMG 102 in combination
      for the treatment of GBM patients. These results illustrate that GBM cells can
      rapidly change the RTK driving their oncogene addiction if the alternate RTK
      signals through the same downstream pathway. Consequently, inhibition of a
      dominant oncogene by targeted therapy can alter the hierarchy of RTKs resulting
      in rapid therapeutic resistance.

      Melanoma.
PG  - 115-31
AB  - Melanoma and other cancers harbor oncogenic mutations in the protein kinase
      B-Raf, which leads to constitutive activation and dysregulation of MAP kinase
      signaling. In order to elucidate molecular determinants responsible for B-Raf
      control of cancer phenotypes, we present a method for phosphoprotein profiling,
      using negative ionization mass spectrometry to detect phosphopeptides based on
      their fragment ion signature caused by release of PO3−. The method provides an
      alternative strategy for phosphoproteomics, circumventing affinity enrichment of 
      phosphopeptides and isotopic labeling of samples. Ninety phosphorylation events
      were regulated by oncogenic B-Raf signaling, based on their responses to treating
      melanoma cells with MKK1/2 inhibitor. Regulated phosphoproteins included known
      signaling effectors and cytoskeletal regulators. We investigated MINERVA/FAM129B,
      a target belonging to a protein family with unknown category and function, and
      established the importance of this protein and its MAP kinase-dependent
      phosphorylation in controlling melanoma cell invasion into 3-dimensional collagen
      matrix.

TI  - Identification and Characterization of Neuronal Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase 
      Substrates Using a Specific Phosphomotif Antibody*S⃞.
PG  - 681-95
AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) control neuronal synaptic function;
      however, little is known about the synaptic substrates regulated by MAPKs. A
      phosphopeptide library incorporating the MAPK consensus motif (PX(pS/pT)P where
      pS is phosphoserine and pT is phosphothreonine) was used to raise a
      phosphospecific antibody that detected MAPK-mediated phosphorylation. The
      antibody (termed “5557”) recognized a variety of phosphoproteins in the brain,
      many of which were enriched in postsynaptic density fractions. The immunoblot
      pattern changed rapidly in response to altered synaptic activity and with the
      inhibition of specific MAPKs and protein phosphatases. By immunoaffinity
      purification with 5557 antibody followed by mass spectrometry, we identified 449 
      putative MAPK substrates of which many appeared dynamically regulated in neuron
      cultures. Several of the novel candidate MAPK substrates were validated by in
      vitro phosphorylation assays. Additionally 82 specific phosphorylation sites were
      identified in 34 proteins, including Ser-447 in δ-catenin, a component of the
      cadherin adhesion complex. We further raised another phosphospecific antibody to 
      confirm that δ-catenin Ser-447 is modified in neurons by the MAPK JNK in a
      synaptic activity-dependent manner. Ser-447 phosphorylation by JNK appears to be 
      correlated with δ-catenin degradation, and a δ-catenin mutant defective in
      Ser-447 phosphorylation showed enhanced ability to promote dendrite branching in 
      cultured neurons. Thus, phosphomotif-based affinity purification is a powerful
      approach to identify novel substrates of MAPKs in vivo and to reveal functionally
      significant phosphorylation events.

PG  - 2776-90
AB  - Anaplastic large cell lymphoma represents a subset of neoplasms caused by
      translocations that juxtapose the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) to
      dimerization partners. The constitutive activation of ALK fusion proteins leads
      to cellular transformation through a complex signaling network. To elucidate the 
      ALK pathways sustaining lymphomagenesis and tumor maintenance, we analyzed the
      tyrosine-kinase protein profiles of ALK-positive cell lines using 2 complementary
      proteomic-based approaches, taking advantage of a specific ALK RNA interference
      (RNAi) or cell-permeable inhibitors. A well-defined set of ALK-associated
      tyrosine phosphopeptides, including metabolic enzymes, kinases, ribosomal and
      cytoskeletal proteins, was identified. Validation studies confirmed that
      vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
      ribonucleotide formyltransferase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC)
      associated with nucleophosmin (NPM)–ALK, and their phosphorylation required ALK
      activity. ATIC phosphorylation was documented in cell lines and primary tumors
      carrying ALK proteins and other tyrosine kinases, including TPR-Met and wild type
      c-Met. Functional analyses revealed that ALK-mediated ATIC phosphorylation
      enhanced its enzymatic activity, dampening the methotrexate-mediated
      transformylase activity inhibition. These findings demonstrate that proteomic
      approaches in well-controlled experimental settings allow the definition of
      informative proteomic profiles and the discovery of novel ALK downstream players 
      that contribute to the maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype. Prediction of
      tumor responses to methotrexate may justify specific molecular-based
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Identification of Phosphorylation-Dependent Binding Partners of Aquaporin-2 Using
      Protein Mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 1540-54
AB  - Vasopressin-mediated control of water permeability in the renal collecting duct
      occurs in part through regulation of the distribution of aquaporin-2 (AQP2)
      between the apical plasma membrane and intracellular membrane compartments.
      Phosphorylation of Ser-256 at AQP2's cytoplasmic COOH-terminus is well-accepted
      as a critical step for translocation. The aim of this study was to identify
      binding partners to phosphorylated versus nonphosphorylated forms of the AQP2
      COOH-terminus via a targeted comparative proteomic approach. Cytosol from inner
      medullary collecting ducts isolated from rat kidneys was incubated with “bait”
      peptides, representing the COOH-terminal AQP2 tail in its nonphosphorylated and
      phosphorylated forms, to capture differentially-bound proteins prior to LC-MS/MS 
      analysis. Mass spectrometric results were confirmed by immunoblotting.
      Immunoprecipitation was performed using an AQP2 COOH-terminal antibody combined
      with immunblotting against the proposed binding partners in order to demonstrate 
      interactions with native AQP2. Our studies confirmed previously identified
      interactions between AQP2 and hsc70, hsp70−1 and −2, as well as annexin II. These
      proteins were found to bind less to the Ser-256-phosphorylated AQP2 than to the
      non-phosphorylated form. In contrast, another heat shock protein, hsp70−5
      (BiP/grp78), bound to phosphorylated AQP2 more avidly than to non-phosphorylated 
      AQP2. Immunogold EM studies demonstrated that BiP is present not only in the ER, 
      but in the cytoplasm and apical plasma membrane of rat collecting duct cells.
      Furthermore, confocal immunofluorescence studies showed partial colocalization of
      BiP with AQP2 in non-ER compartments. These results suggest that phosphorylation 
      of AQP2 at Ser-256 may regulate AQP2 trafficking in part by mediating
      differential binding of hsp70 family proteins to the COOH-terminal tail.

TI  - The Coming of Age of Axonal Neurotrophin Signaling Endosomes.
PG  - 46-55
AB  - Neurons of both the central and the peripheral nervous system are critically
      dependent on neurotrophic signals for their survival and differentiation. The
      trophic signal is originated at the axonal terminals that innervate the
      target(s). It has been well established that the signal must be retrogradely
      transported back to the cell body to exert its trophic effect. Among the many
      forms of transmitted signals, the signaling endosome serves as a primary means to
      ensure that the retrograde signal is delivered to the cell body with sufficient
      fidelity and specificity. Recent evidence suggests that disruption of axonal
      transport of neurotrophin signals may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases
      such as Alzheimer’s disease and Down syndrome. However, the identity of the
      endocytic vesicular carrier(s), and the mechanisms involved in retrogradely
      transporting the signaling complexes remains a matter of debate. In this review, 
      we summarize current insights that are mainly based on classical
      hypothesis-driven research, and we emphasize the urgent needs to carry out
      proteomics to resolve the controversies in the field.

TI  - Proteome-Wide Identification of Novel Binding Partners to the Oncogenic Fusion
      Gene Protein, NPM-ALK, using Tandem Affinity Purification and Mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 361-70
AB  - Nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK), an oncogenic fusion gene
      protein that is characteristically found in a subset of anaplastic large cell
      lymphomas, promotes tumorigenesis through its functional and physical
      interactions with various biologically important proteins. The identification of 
      these interacting proteins has proven to be useful to further our understanding
      of NPM-ALK-mediated tumorigenesis. For the first time, we performed a
      proteome-wide identification of NPM-ALK-binding proteins using tandem affinity
      purification and a highly sensitive mass spectrometric technique. Tandem affinity
      purification is a recently developed method that carries a lower background and
      higher sensitivity compared with the conventional immunoprecipitation-based
      protein purification protocols. The NPM-ALK gene was cloned into an HB-tagged
      vector and expressed in GP293 cells. Three independent experiments were performed
      and the reproducibility of the data was 68%. The vast majority of the previously 
      reported NPM-ALK-binding proteins were detected. We also identified proteins that
      are involved in various cellular processes that were not previously described in 
      association with NPM-ALK, such as MCM6 and MSH2 (DNA repair), Nup98 and importin 
      8 (subcellular protein transport), Stim1 (calcium signaling), 82Fip (RNA
      regulation), and BAG2 (proteosome degradation). We believe that these data
      highlight the functional diversity of NPM-ALK and provide new research directions
      for the study of the biology of this oncoprotein.

TI  - Oncogenic Gene Fusions in Epithelial Carcinomas.
PG  - 82-91
AB  - New discoveries regarding recurrent chromosomal aberrations in epithelial tumors 
      have challenged the view that gene fusions play a minor role in these cancers. It
      is now known that recurrent fusions characterize significant subsets of prostate,
      breast, lung and renal-cell carcinomas, among others. This work has generated new
      insights into the molecular subtypes of tumors and highlighted important advances
      in bioinformatics, sequencing and microarray technology as tools for gene fusion 
      discovery. Given the ubiquity of tyrosine kinases and transcription factors in
      gene fusions, further interest in the potential “druggability” of gene fusions
      with targeted therapeutics has also flourished. Nevertheless, the majority of
      chromosomal abnormalities in epithelial cancers remain uncharacterized,
      underscoring the limitations of our knowledge of carcinogenesis and the
      requirement for further research.

TI  - Large-Scale Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics of Urinary Exosomes.
PG  - 363-79
AB  - Normal human urine contains large numbers of exosomes, which are 40- to 100-nm
      vesicles that originate as the internal vesicles in multivesicular bodies from
      every renal epithelial cell type facing the urinary space. Here, we used LC-MS/MS
      to profile the proteome of human urinary exosomes. Overall, the analysis
      identified 1132 proteins unambiguously, including 177 that are represented on the
      Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database of disease-related genes, suggesting
      that exosome analysis is a potential approach to discover urinary biomarkers. We 
      extended the proteomic analysis to phosphoproteomic profiling using neutral loss 
      scanning, and this yielded multiple novel phosphorylation sites, including
      serine-811 in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter, NCC. To demonstrate
      the potential use of exosome analysis to identify a genetic renal disease, we
      carried out immunoblotting of exosomes from urine samples of patients with a
      clinical diagnosis of Bartter syndrome type I, showing an absence of the
      sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter 2, NKCC2. The proteomic data are
      publicly accessible at http://dir.nhlbi.nih.gov/papers/lkem/exosome/.

TI  - MET as a target for treatment of chest tumours.
PG  - 169-79
AB  - The receptor tyrosine kinase MET has been studied of a large variety of human
      cancers, including lung and mesothelioma. The MET receptor and its ligand HGF
      (hepatocyte growth factor) play important roles in cell growth, survival and
      migration, and dysregulation of the HGF-MET pathway leads to oncogenic changes
      including tumor proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. In small cell lung
      cancer (SCLC), non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and malignant pleural
      mesothelioma (MPM), MET is dysregulated via overexpression, constitutive
      activation, gene amplification, ligand-dependent activation, mutation or
      epigenetic mechanisms. New drugs targeted against MET and HGF are currently being
      investigated in vitro and in vivo, with promising results. These drugs function
      at a variety of steps within the HGF-MET pathway, including MET expression at the
      RNA or protein level, the ligand-receptor interaction, and tyrosine kinase
      function. This paper will review the structure, function, mechanisms of
      tumorigenesis, and potential for therapeutic inhibition of the MET receptor in
      lung cancer and mesothelioma.

TI  - Restriction of Src activity by Cullin-5.
PG  - 157-62
AB  - Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that coordinates responses to diverse
      soluble and adhesive signaling molecules and regulates cell proliferation,
      survival, differentiation and migration [1]. Normally, Src activity is tightly
      regulated, and Src-catalyzed phosphorylation is counterbalanced by
      phosphotyrosine phosphatases [2, 3]. However, deregulated mutant Src causes
      malignant transformation when highly expressed [4]. Src transformation is dose
      dependent, but it has been unclear how much mutant Src, compared with endogenous 
      Src, is required for transformation [5]. Here, we show that transformation
      requires highlevel overexpression of mutant src mRNA, in part because active Src 
      protein is degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis [6]. We show that active
      but not inactive Src protein is downregulated depending on the putative tumor
      suppressor and E3 ubiquitin ligase component, Cullin-5 (Cul5). Cul5 removal
      synergizes with physiological levels of mutant src mRNA to increase protein
      tyrosine phosphorylation, induce morphological transformation, and deregulate
      growth. Cul5 also represses Src-induced tumorigenesis and regulates Src signaling
      in normal cells. These results suggest that, when Src is activated by mutation or
      physiological mechanisms, its effects are limited by Cul5, which downregulates
      active Src and its phosphorylated substrates. These findings demonstrate the
      importance of a new mechanism that downregulates Src signaling in cells.

AB  - Cellular signaling networks have evolved to enable swift and accurate responses, 
      even in the face of genetic or environmental perturbation. Thus, genetic screens 
      may not identify all the genes that regulate different biological processes.
      Moreover, although classical screening approaches have succeeded in providing
      parts lists of the essential components of signaling networks, they typically do 
      not provide much insight into the hierarchical and functional relations that
      exist among these components. We describe a high-throughput screen in which we
      used RNA interference to systematically inhibit two genes simultaneously in
      17,724 combinations to identify regulators of Drosophila JUN NH2-terminal kinase 
      (JNK). Using both genetic and phosphoproteomics data, we then implemented an
      integrative network algorithm to construct a JNK phosphorylation network, which
      provides structural and mechanistic insights into the systems architecture of JNK
      signaling.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteome Analysis of Lysophosphatidic Acid Induced Chemotaxis
      applying Dual-step 18O Labeling Coupled with Immobilized Metal-ion Affinity
      Chromatography.
PG  - 4215-24
AB  - Reversible protein phosphorylation is a central cellular regulatory mechanism in 
      modulating protein activity and propagating signals within cellular pathways and 
      networks. Development of more effective methods for the simultaneous
      identification of phosphorylation sites and quantification of temporal changes in
      protein phosphorylation could provide important insights into molecular signaling
      mechanisms in various cellular processes. Here we present an integrated
      quantitative phosphoproteomics approach and its application for comparative
      analysis of Cos-7 cells in response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) gradient
      stimulation. The approach combines trypsin-catalyzed 16O/18O labeling plus
      16O/18O-methanol esterification labeling for quantitation, a macro-Immobilized
      Metal-ion Affinity Chromatography trap for phosphopeptide enrichment, and
      LC-MS/MS analysis. LC separation and MS/MS are followed by neutral loss-dependent
      MS/MS/MS for phosphopeptide identification using a linear ion trap (LTQ)-FT mass 
      spectrometer. A variety of phosphorylated proteins were identified and quantified
      including receptors, kinases, proteins associated with small GTPases, and
      cytoskeleton proteins. A number of hypothetical proteins were also identified as 
      differentially expressed followed by LPA stimulation, and we have shown evidence 
      of pseudopodia subcellular localization of one of these candidate proteins. These
      results demonstrate the efficiency of this quantitative phosphoproteomics
      approach and its application for rapid discovery of phosphorylation events
      associated with LPA gradient sensing and cell chemotaxis.

AB  - Cancer impacts each patient and family differently. Our current understanding of 
      the disease is primarily limited to clinical hallmarks of cancer, but many
      specific molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Genetic markers can be used to
      determine predisposition to tumor development, but molecularly targeted treatment
      strategies that improve patient prognosis are not widely available for most
      cancers. Individualized care plans, also described as personalized medicine,
      still must be developed by understanding and implementing basic science research 
      into clinical treatment. Proteomics holds great promise in contributing to the
      prevention and cure of cancer because it provides unique tools for discovery of
      biomarkers and therapeutic targets. As such, proteomics can help translate basic 
      science discoveries into the clinical practice of personalized medicine. Here we 
      describe how biological mass spectrometry and proteome analysis interact with
      other major patient care and research initiatives and present vignettes
      illustrating efforts in discovery of diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer,
      development of treatment strategies in lung cancer, and monitoring prognosis and 
      relapse in multiple myeloma patients.

TI  - Physiology and pathophysiology of the vasopressin-regulated renal water
      reabsorption.
PG  - 1005-24
AB  - To prevent dehydration, terrestrial animals and humans have developed a sensitive
      and versatile system to maintain their water homeostasis. In states of
      hypernatremia or hypovolemia, the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP) is
      released from the pituitary and binds its type-2 receptor in renal principal
      cells. This triggers an intracellular cAMP signaling cascade, which
      phosphorylates aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and targets the channel to the apical plasma
      membrane. Driven by an osmotic gradient, pro-urinary water then passes the
      membrane through AQP2 and leaves the cell on the basolateral side via AQP3 and
      AQP4 water channels. When water homeostasis is restored, AVP levels decline, and 
      AQP2 is internalized from the plasma membrane, leaving the plasma membrane
      watertight again. The action of AVP is counterbalanced by several hormones like
      prostaglandin E2, bradykinin, dopamine, endothelin-1, acetylcholine, epidermal
      growth factor, and purines. Moreover, AQP2 is strongly involved in the
      pathophysiology of disorders characterized by renal concentrating defects, as
      well as conditions associated with severe water retention. This review focuses on
      our recent increase in understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
      AVP-regulated renal water transport in both health and disease.

TI  - Can Systems Biology Understand Pathway Activation? Gene Expression Signatures as 
      Surrogate Markers for Understanding the Complexity of Pathway Activation.
PG  - 349-60
AB  - Cancer is thought to be caused by a sequence of multiple genetic and epigenetic
      alterations which occur in one or more of the genes controlling cell cycle
      progression and signaling transduction. The complexity of carcinogenic mechanisms
      leads to heterogeneity in molecular phenotype, pathology, and prognosis of
      cancers.Genome-wide mutational analysis of cancer genes in individual tumors is
      the most direct way to elucidate the complex process of disease progression,
      although such high-throughput sequencing technologies are not yet fully
      developed. As a surrogate marker for pathway activation analysis, expression
      profiling using microarrays has been successfully applied for the classification 
      of tumor types, stages of tumor progression, or in some cases, prediction of
      clinical outcomes. However, the biological implication of those gene expression
      signatures is often unclear. Systems biological approaches leverage the signature
      genes as a representation of changes in signaling pathways, instead of
      interpreting the relevance between each gene and phenotype. This approach, which 
      can be achieved by comparing the gene set or the expression profile with those of
      reference experiments in which a defined pathway is modulated, will improve our
      understanding of cancer classification, clinical outcome, and carcinogenesis. In 
      this review, we will discuss recent studies on the development of expression
      signatures to monitor signaling pathway activities and how these signatures can
      be used to improve the identification of responders to anticancer drugs.

PG  - 263-74
AB  - Mass spectrometry has served as a major tool for the discipline of proteomics to 
      catalogue proteins in an unprecedented scale. With chemical and metabolic
      techniques for stable isotope labeling developed over the past decade, it is now 
      routinely used as a method for relative quantification to provide valuable
      information on alteration of protein abundance in a proteome-wide scale. More
      recently, absolute or stoichiometric quantification of proteome is becoming
      feasible, in particular, with the development of strategies with isotope-labeled 
      standards composed of concatenated peptides. On the other hand, remarkable
      progress has been also made in label-free quantification methods based on the
      number of identified peptides. Here we review these mass spectrometry-based
      approaches for absolute quantification of proteome and discuss their
      implications.

TI  - A quantitative study of the recruitment potential of all intracellular tyrosine

PG  - 643-53
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit and process extracellular cues by recruiting
      intracellular signaling proteins to sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. Using
      protein microarrays comprising virtually every human SH2 and PTB domain, we
      generated quantitative protein interaction maps for three well-studied
      receptors—EGFR, FGFR1 and IGF1R—using phosphopeptides derived from every
      intracellular tyrosine residue on each receptor, regardless of whether or not
      they are phosphorylated in vivo. We found that, in general, peptides derived from
      physiological sites of tyrosine phosphorylation bind to substantially more SH2 or
      PTB domains than do peptides derived from nonphysiological sites, supporting the 
      idea that kinases and interaction domains co-evolve and suggesting that new sites
      arise predominantly through selection favoring advantageous interactions, rather 
      than through selection disfavoring unwanted interactions. We also found
      substantial qualitative overlap in the recruitment profiles of these three
      receptors, suggesting that their different biological effects arise, at least in 
      part, from quantitative differences in their affinities for the proteins they
      recruit.

PG  - 2140-50
AB  - Phosphoproteomics, the targeted study of a subfraction of the proteome which is
      modified by phosphorylation, has become an indispensable tool to study cell
      signaling dynamics. We described a methodology that linked phosphoproteome and
      proteome analysis based on Ba2+ binding properties of amino acids. This
      technology selected motif-specific phosphopeptides independent of the system
      under analysis. MudPIT (Multidimensional Identification Technology) identified
      1037 precipitated phosphopeptides from as little as 250µg of proteins. To extend 
      coverage of the phosphoproteome, we sampled the nuclear extract of HeLa cells
      with three values of Ba2+ ions molarity. The presence of more than 70% of
      identified phosphoproteins was further substantiated by their non-modified
      peptides. Upon isoproterenol stimulation of HEK cells, we identified an
      increasing number of phosphoproteins from MAPK cascades and AKAP signaling hubs. 
      We quantified changes in both protein and phosphorylation levels of 197
      phosphoproteins including a critical kinase, MAPK1. Integration of differential
      phosphorylation of MAPK1 with knowledge bases constructed modules that correlated
      well with its role as node in cross-talk of canonical pathways.

TI  - Counteractive Control of Polarized Morphogenesis during Mating by
      Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Fus3 and G1 Cyclin-dependent Kinase.
PG  - 1739-52
AB  - Cell polarization in response to external cues is critical to many eukaryotic
      cells. During pheromone-induced mating in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Fus3 induces polarization of the actin
      cytoskeleton toward a landmark generated by the pheromone receptor. Here, we
      analyze the role of Fus3 activation and cell cycle arrest in mating
      morphogenesis. The MAPK scaffold Ste5 is initially recruited to the plasma
      membrane in random patches that polarize before shmoo emergence. Polarized
      localization of Ste5 is important for shmooing. In fus3 mutants, Ste5 is
      recruited to significantly more of the plasma membrane, whereas recruitment of
      Bni1 formin, Cdc24 guanine exchange factor, and Ste20 p21-activated protein
      kinase are inhibited. In contrast, polarized recruitment still occurs in a far1
      mutant that is also defective in G1 arrest. Remarkably, loss of Cln2 or Cdc28
      cyclin-dependent kinase restores polarized localization of Bni1, Ste5, and Ste20 
      to a fus3 mutant. These and other findings suggest Fus3 induces polarized growth 
      in G1 phase cells by down-regulating Ste5 recruitment and by inhibiting Cln/Cdc28
      kinase, which prevents basal recruitment of Ste5, Cdc42-mediated asymmetry, and
      mating morphogenesis.

TI  - Proteomics Studies of Brassinosteroid Signal Transduction Using Prefractionation 
      and Two-dimensional DIGE*.
PG  - 728-38
AB  - Signal transduction involves posttranslational modifications and protein-protein 
      interactions, which can be studied by proteomics. In Arabidopsis, the steroid
      hormone (brassinosteroid (BR)) binds to the extracellular domain of a receptor
      kinase (BRI1) to initiate a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade that
      controls gene expression and plant growth. Here we detected early BR signaling
      events and identified early response proteins using prefractionation and
      two-dimensional (2-D) DIGE. Proteomic changes induced rapidly by BR treatments
      were detected in phosphoprotein and plasma membrane (PM) fractions by 2-D DIGE
      but not in total protein extracts. LC-MS/MS analysis of gel spots identified 19
      BR-regulated PM proteins and six proteins from phosphoprotein fractions. These
      include the BAK1 receptor kinase and BZR1 transcription factor of the BR
      signaling pathway. Both proteins showed spot shifts consistent with BR-regulated 
      phosphorylation. In addition, in vivo phosphorylation sites were identified for
      BZR1, two tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, and a phosphoenolpyruvate
      carboxykinase (PCK1). Overexpression of a novel BR-induced PM protein (DREPP)
      partially suppressed the phenotypes of a BR-deficient mutant, demonstrating its
      important function in BR responses. Our study demonstrates that prefractionation 
      coupled with 2-D DIGE is a powerful approach for studying signal transduction.

TI  - Dissection of the insulin signaling pathway via quantitative phosphoproteomics.
PG  - 2451-6
AB  - The insulin signaling pathway is of pivotal importance in metabolic diseases,
      such as diabetes, and in cellular processes, such as aging. Insulin activates a
      tyrosine phosphorylation cascade that branches to create a complex network
      affecting multiple biological processes. To understand the full spectrum of the
      tyrosine phosphorylation cascade, we have defined the tyrosine-phosphoproteome of
      the insulin signaling pathway, using high resolution mass spectrometry in
      combination with phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation and stable isotope labeling 
      by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in differentiated brown adipocytes. Of 40 
      identified insulin-induced effectors, 7 have not previously been described in
      insulin signaling, including SDR, PKCδ binding protein, LRP-6, and PISP/PDZK11, a
      potential calcium ATPase binding protein. A proteomic interaction screen with
      PISP/PDZK11 identified the calcium transporting ATPase SERCA2, supporting a
      connection to calcium signaling. The combination of quantitative
      phosphoproteomics with cell culture models provides a powerful strategy to
      dissect the insulin signaling pathways in intact cells.

TI  - A novel phosphoprotein analysis scheme for assessing changes in premalignant and 
      malignant breast cell lines using 2D liquid separations, protein microarrays and 
      tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 51-66
AB  - An analysis of phosphorylation changes that occur during cancer progression would
      provide insights into the molecular pathways responsible for a malignant
      phenotype. In this study we employed a novel coupling of 2D-liquid separations
      and protein microarray technology to reveal changes in phosphoprotein status
      between premalignant (AT1) and malignant (CA1a) cell lines derived from the human
      MCF10A breast cell lines. Intact proteins were first separated according to their
      isoelectric point and hydrophobicities, then arrayed on SuperAmine glass slides. 
      Phosphoproteins were detected using the universal, inorganic phospho-sensor dye, 
      ProQ Diamond. Using this dye, out of 140 spots that were positive for
      phosphorylation, a total of 85 differentially expressed spots were detected over 
      a pH range of 7.2 to 4.0. Proteins were identified and their peptides sequenced
      by mass spectrometry. The strategy enabled the identification of 75
      differentially expressed phosphoproteins, from which 51 phosphorylation sites in 
      27 unique proteins were confirmed. Interestingly, the majority of differentially 
      expressed phosphorylated proteins observed were nuclear proteins. Three
      regulators of apoptosis, Bad, Bax and Acinus, were also differentially
      phosphorylated in the two cell lines. Further development of this strategy will
      facilitate an understanding of the mechanisms involved in malignancy progression 
      and other disease-related phenotypes.

TI  - DLC-1:a Rho GTPase-activating protein and tumour suppressor.
PG  - 1185-207
AB  - The deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC-1) gene encodes a GTPase activating protein
      that acts as a negative regulator of the Rho family of small GTPases. Rho
      proteins transduce signals that influence cell morphology and physiology, and
      their aberrant up-regulation is a key factor in the neoplastic process, including
      metastasis. Since its discovery, compelling evidence has accumulated that
      demonstrates a role for DLC-1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in different 
      types of human cancer. Loss of DLC-1 expression mediated by genetic and
      epigenetic mechanisms has been associated with the development of many human
      cancers, and restoration of DLC-1 expression inhibited the growth of tumour cells
      in vivo and in vitro. Two closely related genes, DLC-2 and DLC-3, may also be
      tumour suppressors. This review presents the current status of progress in
      understanding the biological functions of DLC-1 and its relatives and their roles
      in neoplasia.

TI  - Downstream signalling and specific inhibition of c-MET/HGF pathway in small cell 
      lung cancer: implications for tumour invasion.
PG  - 368-77
AB  - The c-MET receptor can be overexpressed, amplified, or mutated in solid tumours
      including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In c-MET-overexpressing SCLC cell line
      NCI-H69, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) dramatically induced c-MET
      phosphorylation at phosphoepitopes pY1230/1234/1235 (catalytic tyrosine kinase), 
      pY1003 (juxtamembrane), and also of paxillin at pY31 (CRKL-binding site). We
      utilised a global proteomics phosphoantibody array approach to identify further
      c-MET/HGF signal transduction intermediates in SCLC. Strong HGF induction of
      specific phosphorylation sites in phosphoproteins involved in c-MET/HGF signal
      transduction was detected, namely adducin-α [S724], adducin-γ [S662], CREB
      [S133], ERK1 [T185/Y187], ERK1/2 [T202/Y204], ERK2 [T185/Y187], MAPKK (MEK) 1/2
      [S221/S225], MAPKK (MEK) 3/6 [S189/S207], RB [S612], RB1 [S780], JNK [T183/Y185],
      STAT3 [S727], focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [Y576/S722/S910], p38α-MAPK
      [T180/Y182], and AKT1[S473] and [T308]. Conversely, inhibition of phosphorylation
      by HGF in protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase R (PKR), and also CDK1 was
      identified. Phosphoantibody-based immunohistochemical analysis of SCLC tumour
      tissue and microarray established the role of c-MET in SCLC biology. This
      supports a role of c-MET activation in tumour invasive front in the tumour
      progression and invasion involving FAK and AKT downstream. The c-MET serves as an
      attractive therapeutic target in SCLC, as shown through small interfering RNA
      (siRNA) and selective prototype c-MET inhibitor SU11274, inhibiting the
      phosphorylation of c-MET itself and its downstream molecules such as AKT, S6
      kinase, and ERK1/2. Investigation of mechanisms of invasion and, ultimately,
      metastasis in SCLC would be very useful with these signal transduction molecules.

TI  - Profiling signaling polarity in chemotactic cells.
PG  - 8328-33
AB  - Cell movement requires morphological polarization characterized by formation of a
      leading pseudopodium (PD) at the front and a trailing rear at the back. However, 
      little is known about how protein networks are spatially integrated to regulate
      this process at the system level. Here, we apply global proteome profiling in
      combination with newly developed quantitative phosphoproteomics approaches for
      comparative analysis of the cell body (CB) and PD proteome of chemotactic cells. 
      The spatial relationship of 3,509 proteins and 228 distinct sites of
      phosphorylation were mapped revealing networks of signaling proteins that
      partition to the PD and/or the CB compartments. The major network represented in 
      the PD includes integrin signaling, actin regulatory, and axon guidance proteins,
      whereas the CB consists of DNA/RNA metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and
      structural maintenance. Our findings provide insight into the spatial
      organization of signaling networks that control cell movement and provide a
      comprehensive system-wide profile of proteins and phosphorylation sites that
      control cell polarization.

TI  - The RNA-Binding Protein KSRP Promotes Decay of β-Catenin mRNA and Is Inactivated 
      by PI3K-AKT Signaling.
LID - e5
AB  - β-catenin plays an essential role in several biological events including cell
      fate determination, cell proliferation, and transformation. Here we report that
      β-catenin is encoded by a labile transcript whose half-life is prolonged by Wnt
      and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–AKT signaling. AKT phosphorylates the mRNA
      decay-promoting factor KSRP at a unique serine residue, induces its association
      with the multifunctional protein 14-3-3, and prevents KSRP interaction with the
      exoribonucleolytic complex exosome. This impairs KSRP's ability to promote rapid 
      mRNA decay. Our results uncover an unanticipated level of control of β-catenin
      expression pointing to KSRP as a required factor to ensure rapid degradation of
      β-catenin in unstimulated cells. We propose KSRP phosphorylation as a link
      between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–AKT signaling and β-catenin accumulation.

TI  - LC-MS/MS Analysis of Apical and Basolateral Plasma Membranes of Rat Renal
      Collecting Duct Cells*†.
PG  - 2131-45
AB  - We used biotinylation and streptavidin affinity chromatography to label and
      enrich proteins from apical and basolateral membranes of rat kidney inner
      medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs) prior to LC-MS/MS protein identification. To
      enrich apical membrane proteins and bound peripheral membrane proteins, IMCDs
      were perfusion-labeled with primary amine-reactive biotinylation reagents at 2 °C
      using a double barreled pipette. The perfusion-biotinylated proteins and proteins
      bound to them were isolated with CaptAvidin-agarose beads, separated with
      SDS-PAGE, and sliced into continuous gel pieces for LC-MS/MS protein
      identification (LTQ, Thermo Electron Corp.). 17 integral and
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane proteins and 44 non-integral
      membrane proteins were identified. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy
      confirmed ACVRL1, H+/K+-ATPase α1, NHE2, and TauT expression in the IMCDs.
      Basement membrane and basolateral membrane proteins were biotinylated via
      incubation of IMCD suspensions with biotinylation reagents on ice. 23 integral
      and GPI-linked membrane proteins and 134 non-integral membrane proteins were
      identified. Analyses of non-integral membrane proteins preferentially identified 
      in the perfusion-biotinylated and not in the incubation-biotinylated IMCDs
      revealed protein kinases, scaffold proteins, SNARE proteins, motor proteins,
      small GTP-binding proteins, and related proteins that may be involved in
      vasopressin-stimulated AQP2, UT-A1, and ENaC regulation. A World Wide
      Web-accessible database was constructed of 222 membrane proteins (integral and
      GPI-linked) from this study and prior studies.

TI  - Cox-2 is regulated by toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) signaling and is important for 
      proliferation and apoptosis in response to intestinal mucosal injury.
PG  - 862-77
AB  - Background: We have recently demonstrated that mice deficient in TLR4 or its
      adapter molecule MyD88 have increased signs of colitis compared to wild-type (WT)
      mice following dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced injury. We wished to test the
      hypothesis that Cox-2 derived PGE2 is important in TLR4-related mucosal repair.
      Methods: Cox-2 expression was analyzed by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry,
      western blotting, and luciferase reporter constructs. siRNA was used to inhibit
      expression of MyD88. TLR4−/− or WT mice were given 2.5% DSS for 7 days.
      Proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using BrdU staining and TUNEL assays,
      respectively. PGE2 was given orally to DSS-treated mice. Results: Intestinal
      epithelial cell lines upregulated Cox-2 expression in a TLR4- and MyD88-dependent
      fashion. LPS-mediated stimulation of PGE2 production was blocked by a selective
      Cox-2 inhibitor or siRNA against MyD88. Following DSS injury, Cox-2 expression
      increased only in WT mice. TLR4−/− mice have significantly reduced proliferation 
      and increased apoptosis following DSS injury compared to WT mice. PGE2
      supplementation of TLR4−/− mice resulted in improvement in clinical signs of
      colitis and restoration of proliferation and apoptosis to wild-type values. The
      mechanism for improved epithelial repair may be through PGE2-dependent activation
      of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Conclusion: We describe an important
      link between TLR4 signaling and Cox-2 expression in the gut. TLR4 and MyD88
      signaling are required for optimal proliferation and protection against apoptosis
      in the injured intestine. Although TLR4 signaling is beneficial in the
      short-term, chronic signaling through TLR4 may lower the threshold for
      colitis-associated cancer.

TI  - Quantitative phosphoproteomics of vasopressin-sensitive renal cells: Regulation
      of aquaporin-2 phosphorylation at two sites.
PG  - 7159-64
AB  - Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in vasopressin signaling in the
      renal-collecting duct. Large-scale identification and quantification of
      phosphorylation events triggered by vasopressin is desirable to gain a
      comprehensive systems-level understanding of this process. We carried out
      phosphoproteomic analysis of rat inner medullary collecting duct cells by using a
      combination of phosphopeptide enrichment by immobilized metal affinity
      chromatography and phosphorylation site identification by liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometryn neutral loss scanning. A total of 714
      phosphorylation sites on 223 unique phosphoproteins were identified from inner
      medullary collecting duct samples treated short-term with either calyculin A or
      vasopressin. A number of proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization,
      vesicle trafficking, and transcriptional regulation were identified. Previously
      unidentified phosphorylation sites were found for membrane proteins essential to 
      collecting duct physiology, including eight sites among aquaporin-2 (AQP2),
      aquaporin-4, and urea transporter isoforms A1 and A3. Through label-free
      quantification of phosphopeptides, we identified a number of proteins that
      significantly changed phosphorylation state in response to short-term vasopressin
      treatment: AQP2, Bclaf1, LRRC47, Rgl3, and SAFB2. In the presence of vasopressin,
      AQP2 monophosphorylated at S256 and diphosphorylated AQP2 (pS256/261) increased
      in abundance, whereas AQP2 monophosphorylated at S261 decreased, raising the
      possibility that both sites are involved in vasopressin-dependent AQP2
      trafficking. This study reveals the practicality of liquid chromotography-mass
      spectrometryn neutral loss scanning for large-scale identification and
      quantification of protein phosphorylation in the analysis of cell signaling in a 
      native mammalian system.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphotyrosine Proteomics of EphB2 Signaling by Stable Isotope
      Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC).
PG  - 581-8
AB  - Eph-related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) have been implicated in several
      biological functions including synaptic plasticity, axon guidance and
      morphogenesis, yet the details of the signal transduction pathways that produce
      these specific biological functions after ligand-receptor interaction remain
      unclear. We used Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC)
      in combination with LC-MS/MS to characterize cellular signaling following
      stimulation by ephrinB1-Fc of NG-108 cells that overexpress EphB2 receptors.
      Because tyrosine phosphorylation functions as a key regulatory event in RTK
      signaling, we used anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation (pY IP) of cell
      lysates to isolate potential participants in the EphB2 pathway. Our SILAC
      experiments identified 127 unique proteins, 40 of which demonstrated increased
      abundance in pY IPs from ephrinB1-Fc stimulated cells as compared with
      unstimulated cells. Six proteins demonstrated decreased abundance, and 81 did not
      change significantly in relative abundance. Western blotting analysis of five
      proteins after pY IP verified their SILAC results. Based on previously published 
      work and use of PathwayAssist™ software, we proposed an interaction network
      downstream of EphB2 for the proteins with changed ratios.

TI  - Phosphoproteomics reveals extensive in vivo phosphorylation of Arabidopsis
      proteins involved in RNA metabolism.
PG  - 3267-78
AB  - Most regulatory pathways are governed by the reversible phosphorylation of
      proteins. Recent developments in mass spectrometry-based technology allow the
      large-scale analysis of protein phosphorylation. Here, we show the application of
      immobilized metal affinity chromatography to purify phosphopeptides from
      Arabidopsis extracts. Phosphopeptide sequences were identified by liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS/MS). A total of 79 unique
      phosphorylation sites were determined in 22 phosphoproteins with a putative role 
      in RNA metabolism, including splicing of mRNAs. Among these phosphoproteins, 12
      Ser/Arg-rich (SR) splicing factors were identified. A conserved phosphorylation
      site was found in most of the phosphoproteins, including the SR proteins,
      suggesting that these proteins are targeted by the same or a highly related
      protein kinase. To test this hypothesis, Arabidopsis SR protein-specific kinase 4
      (SRPK4) that was initially identified as an interactor of SR proteins was tested 
      for its ability to phosphorylate the SR protein RSp31. In vitro kinase assays
      showed that all in vivo phosphorylation sites of RSp31 were targeted by SRPK4.
      These data suggest that the plant mRNA splicing machinery is a major target of
      phosphorylation and that a considerable number of proteins involved in RNA
      metabolism may be targeted by SRPKs.

TI  - Synaptic Plasticity, a Symphony in GEF.
PG  - 348-65
AB  - Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic sites for the majority of excitatory
      synapses in the mammalian forebrain. While many spines display great stability,
      others change shape in a matter of seconds to minutes. These rapid alterations in
      dendritic spine number and size require tight control of the actin cytoskeleton, 
      the main structural component of dendritic spines. The ability of neurons to
      alter spine number and size is essential for the expression of neuronal
      plasticity. Within spines, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) act as
      critical regulators of the actin cytoskeleton by controlling the activity of
      Rho-GTPases. In this review, we focus on the Rho-GEFs expressed in the nucleus
      accumbens and localized to the postsynaptic density and, thus, positioned to
      effect rapid alterations in the structure of dendritic spines. We review
      literature that ties these GEFs to different receptor systems and intracellular
      signaling cascades and discuss the effects these interactions are likely to have 
      on synaptic plasticity.

PG  - 608-28
AB  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have
      shown dramatic effects against that tumors harboring EGFR activating mutations in
      the EGFR intracytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain and resulted in cell apoptosis. 
      Unfortunately, a number of patients ultimately developed resistance by multiple
      mechanisms. Thus, elucidation of the mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs can
      provide strategies for blocking or reversing the situation. Recent studies
      suggested that redundant kinase activation plays pivotal roles in escaping from
      the effects of EGFR-TKIs. Herein, we aimed to characterize several molecular
      events involved in the resistance to EGFR-TKIs mediated by redundant kinase
      activation.

TI  - Oncogenic signaling by tyrosine kinases of the SRC family in advanced colorectal 
      cancer.
PG  - 357-71
AB  - The non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the SRC family (SFK) play important roles in
      signal transduction induced by a large variety of extracellular stimuli,
      including growth factors and Integrins. When deregulated, SFKs show oncogenic
      activity, as originally reported for v-Src, the transforming product of the avian
      retrovirus RSV, and then, in many human cancers, particularly colorectal cancer
      (CRC). In CRC, SFK deregulation largely occurs in the absence of mutations of the
      corresponding genes, but the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are still
      unclear. In addition to a role in early tumor progression, SFK deregulation may
      also be important in advanced CRC, as suggested by the association between
      increased SFK activity and poor clinical outcome. However, SFK contribution to
      CRC metastasis formation is still poorly documented. Here, we will review recent 
      findings that broaden our understanding of the mechanisms underlying SFK
      deregulation and signaling in advanced CRC. We will also discuss the implication 
      of these observations for SFK-based therapy in metastatic CRC.

      cardiovascular diseases.
PG  - 274-92
AB  - Cardioproteomics (Cardiovascular proteomics) is fast becoming an indispensible
      technique in deciphering changes in signaling pathways that occur in
      cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The quality and availability of the instruments
      and bioinformatics software used for cardioproteomics continues to improve, and
      these techniques are now available to most cardiovascular researchers either
      directly or indirectly via university core centers. The heart and aorta are
      specialized tissues which present unique challenges to investigate. Currently,
      the diverse range of proteomic techniques available for cardiovascular research
      makes the choice of the best method or best combination of methods for the
      disease parameter(s) being investigated as important as the equipment used. This 
      review focuses on proteomic techniques and their applications which have advanced
      our understanding of the signaling mechanisms involved in CVDs at the levels of
      protein complex/protein-protein interaction, post-translational modifications and
      signaling induced protein changes.

TI  - Evolutionary patterns of phosphorylated serines.
PG  - 8
AB  - : Posttranslationally modified amino acids are chemically distinct types of amino
      acids and in terms of evolution they might behave differently from their
      non-modified counterparts. In order to check this possibility, we reconstructed
      the evolutionary history of phosphorylated serines in several groups of
      organisms. Comparisons of substitution vectors have revealed some significant
      differences in the evolution of modified and corresponding non-modified amino
      acids. In particular, phosphoserines are more frequently substituted to aspartate
      and glutamate, compared to non-phosphorylated serines. Reviewers: This article
      was reviewed by Arcady Mushegian and Sandor Pongor.

TI  - A novel mass spectrometry-based assay for GSK-3β activity.
PG  - 29
AB  - Background: As a component of the progression from genomic to proteomic analysis,
      there is a need for accurate assessment of protein post-translational
      modifications such as phosphorylation. Traditional kinase assays rely heavily on 
      the incorporation of γ-P32 radiolabeled isotopes, monoclonal anti-phospho-protein
      antibodies, or gel shift analysis of substrate proteins. In addition to the
      expensive and time consuming nature of these methods, the use of radio-ligands
      imposes restrictions based on the half-life of the radionucleotides and pose
      potential health risks to researchers. With the shortcomings of traditional
      assays in mind, the aim of this study was to develop a high throughput,
      non-radioactive kinase assay for screening Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta
      (GSK-3β) activity. Results: Synthetic peptide substrates designed with a GSK-3β
      phosphorylation site were assayed with both recombinant enzyme and GSK-3β
      immunoprecipitated from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. A molecular weight shift equal to
      that of a single phosphate group (80 Da.) was detected by surface enhanced laser 
      desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) in a GSK-3β
      target peptide (2B-Sp). Not only was there a dose-dependent response in molecular
      weight shift to the amount of recombinant GSK-3β used in this assay, this shift
      was also inhibited by lithium chloride (LiCl), in a dose-dependent manner.
      Conclusion: We present here a novel method to sensitively measure peptide
      phosphorylation by GSK-3β that, due to the incorporation of substrate controls,
      is applicable to either purified enzyme or cell extracts. Future studies using
      this method have the potential to elucidate the activity of GSK-3β in vivo, and
      to screen enzyme activity in relation to a variety of GSK-3β related disorders.

TI  - PKC isoforms interact with and phosphorylate DNMT1.
PG  - 31
AB  - Background: DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) has been shown to be phosphorylated
      on multiple serine and threonine residues, based on cell type and physiological
      conditions. Although recent studies have suggested that protein kinase C (PKC)
      may be involved, the individual contribution of PKC isoforms in their ability to 
      phosphorylate DNMT1 remains unknown. The PKC family consists of at least 12
      isoforms that possess distinct differences in structure, substrate requirement,
      expression and localization. Results: Here we show that PKCα, βI, βII, δ, γ, η, ζ
      and μ preferentially phosphorylate the N-terminal domain of human DNMT1. No such 
      phosphorylation of DNMT1 was observed with PKCε. Using PKCζ as a prototype model,
      we also found that PKC physically interacts with and phosphorylates DNMT1. In
      vitro phosphorylation assays conducted with recombinant fragments of DNMT1 showed
      that PKCζ preferentially phosphorylated the N-terminal region of DNMT1. The
      interaction of PKCζ with DNMT1 was confirmed by GST pull-down and
      co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Co-localization experiments by fluorescent
      microscopy further showed that endogenous PKCζ and DNMT1 were present in the same
      molecular complex. Endogenous PKCζ activity was also detected when DNMT1 was
      immunoprecipitated from HEK-293 cells. Overexpression of both PKCζ and DNMT1 in
      HEK-293 cells, but not of either alone, reduced the methylation status of genes
      distributed across the genome. Moreover, in vitro phosphorylation of DNMT1 by
      PKCζ reduced its methytransferase activity. Conclusions: Our results indicate
      that phosphorylation of human DNMT1 by PKC is isoform-specific and provides the
      first evidence of cooperation between PKCζ and DNMT1 in the control of the DNA
      methylation patterns of the genome.

TI  - Identification of novel signaling components in N,N’-Dinitrosopiperazine-mediated
      metastasis of nasopharyngeal Carcinoma by quantitative phosphoproteomics.
PG  - 243
AB  - Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a highly invasive and metastatic
      cancer. N,N’-dinitrosopiperazine (DNP), a carcinogen with specificity for
      nasopharyngeal epithelium, facilitates NPC metastasis. However, the underlying
      mechanism is not known. Methods: Quantitative phosphoproteomics, using stable
      isotope labeling of amino acids in cell cultures, was employed to identify
      phosphoproteins associated with NPC metastasis mediated by DNP. NPC cell line
      6-10B, which is relatively less metastatic, was used to investigate DNP-mediated 
      metastasis. Boyden chamber invasion assay was used to measure DNP-induced
      motility and invasion, and nude mice were used to verify DNP-mediated metastasis 
      in vivo. Several different phosphoproteins detected by proteomics analysis were
      verified by immunoblotting. DNP-mediated metastasis facilitated by lysine-rich
      CEACAM1 co-isolated protein (LYRIC) phosphorylation at serine 568 was confirmed
      using mutations targeting the phosphorylation site of LYRIC. DNP-mediated
      metastasis through LYRIC phosphorylation was confirmed in the NPC cell line CNE1.
      DNP-mediated LYRIC phosphorylation at serine 568 was also verified in metastatic 
      tumors of BABL/c nude mice. Results: Boyden chamber invasion assay indicated that
      DNP mediated cell motility and invasion of NPC cell 6-10B in vitro, and
      experiments with nude mice indicated that DNP increased 6-10B metastasis in vivo.
      In the phosphoproteomics analysis, we detected 216 phosphorylation sites on 130
      proteins; among these, 48 phosphorylation sites on 30 unique phosphopeptides were
      modulated by DNP by at least 1.5-fold. DNP mediated the expression of
      phosphorylated GTPase, ferritin, LYRIC, and RNA polymerase, and it decreased the 
      expression of phosphorylated torsin-1A protein 1. Furthermore, DNP induced LYRIC 
      phosphorylation at serine 568 to facilitate cell motility and invasion, whereas
      DNP-mediated motility and invasion was decreased when serine 568 in LYRIC was
      mutated. In another NPC cell line, CNE1, DNP also mediated cell motility and
      invasion followed by enhanced phosphorylation of LYRIC at serine 568. Finally,
      phosphorylated-LYRIC expression at serine 568 was significantly increased in
      metastatic tumors induced by DNP. Conclusion: DNP regulates multiple signaling
      pathways through protein phosphorylation, including the phosphorylation of LYRIC 
      at serine 568, and mediates NPC metastasis. These findings provide insights on
      the complexity and dynamics of DNP-facilitated metastasis, and may help to gain a
      better understanding of the mechanisms by clarifying NPC-induced metastasis.

TI  - New insights in osteogenic differentiation revealed by mass spectrometric
      assessment of phosphorylated substrates in murine skin mesenchymal cells.
PG  - 47
AB  - Background: Bone fractures and loss represent significant costs for the public
      health system and often affect the patients quality of life, therefore,
      understanding the molecular basis for bone regeneration is essential. Cytokines, 
      such as IL-6, IL-10 and TNFα, secreted by inflammatory cells at the lesion site, 
      at the very beginning of the repair process, act as chemotactic factors for
      mesenchymal stem cells, which proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts
      through the autocrine and paracrine action of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs),
      mainly BMP-2. Although it is known that BMP-2 binds to ActRI/BMPR and activates
      the SMAD 1/5/8 downstream effectors, little is known about the intracellular
      mechanisms participating in osteoblastic differentiation. We assessed differences
      in the phosphorylation status of different cellular proteins upon BMP-2
      osteogenic induction of isolated murine skin mesenchymal stem cells using Triplex
      Stable Isotope Dimethyl Labeling coupled with LC/MS. Results: From 150 μg of
      starting material, 2,264 proteins were identified and quantified at five
      different time points, 235 of which are differentially phosphorylated. Kinase
      motif analysis showed that several substrates display phosphorylation sites for
      Casein Kinase, p38, CDK and JNK. Gene ontology analysis showed an increase in
      biological processes related with signaling and differentiation at early time
      points after BMP2 induction. Moreover, proteins involved in cytoskeleton
      rearrangement, Wnt and Ras pathways were found to be differentially
      phosphorylated during all timepoints studied. Conclusions: Taken together, these 
      data, allow new insights on the intracellular substrates which are phosphorylated
      early on during differentiation to BMP2-driven osteoblastic differentiation of
      skin-derived mesenchymal stem cells.

TI  - Unraveling incompatibility between wheat and the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria
      tritici through apoplastic proteomics.
LID - 362
AB  - Background: Hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici causes severe
      foliar disease in wheat. However, current knowledge of molecular mechanisms
      involved in plant resistance to Z. tritici and Z. tritici virulence factors is
      far from being complete. The present work investigated the proteome of leaf
      apoplastic fluid with emphasis on both host wheat and Z. tritici during the
      compatible and incompatible interactions. Results: The proteomics analysis
      revealed rapid host responses to the biotrophic growth, including enhanced
      carbohydrate metabolism, apoplastic defenses and stress, and cell wall
      reinforcement, might contribute to resistance. Compatibility between the host and
      the pathogen was associated with inactivated plant apoplastic responses as well
      as fungal defenses to oxidative stress and perturbation of plant cell wall during
      the initial biotrophic stage, followed by the strong induction of plant defenses 
      during the necrotrophic stage. To study the role of anti-oxidative stress in Z.
      tritici pathogenicity in depth, a YAP1 transcription factor regulating
      antioxidant expression was deleted and showed the contribution to anti-oxidative 
      stress in Z. tritici, but was not required for pathogenicity. This result
      suggests the functional redundancy of antioxidants in the fungus. Conclusions:
      The data demonstrate that incompatibility is probably resulted from the
      proteome-level activation of host apoplastic defenses as well as fungal
      incapability to adapt to stress and interfere with host cell at the biotrophic
      stage of the interaction. Electronic supplementary material: The online version

TI  - Quantitative phosphoproteomic profiling of fiber differentiation and initiation
      in a fiberless mutant of cotton.
LID - 466
AB  - Background: The cotton (Gossypium spp.) fiber cell is an important unicellular
      model for studying cell differentiation. There is evidence suggesting that
      phosphorylation is a critical post-translational modification involved in
      regulation of a wide range of cell activities. Nevertheless, the sites of
      phosphorylation in G. hirsutum and their regulatory roles in fiber cell
      initiation are largely unknown. In this study, we employed a mass
      spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to conduct a global and site-specific
      phosphoproteome profiling between ovules of a fuzzless-lintless (fl) Upland
      cotton (G. hirsutum) mutant and its isogenic parental wild type (WT) at -3 and
      0 days post-anthesis (DPA). Results: A total of 830 phosphopeptides and 1,592
      phosphorylation sites from 619 phosphoproteins were identified by iTRAQ (isobaric
      tags for relative and absolute quantitation). Of these, 76 phosphoproteins and
      1,100 phosphorylation sites were identified for the first time after searching
      the P3DB public database using the BLAST program. Among the detected
      phosphopeptides, 69 were differentially expressed between the fl mutant and its
      WT in ovules at -3 and 0 DPA. An analysis using the Motif-X program uncovered 19 
      phosphorylation motifs, 8 of which were unique to cotton. A further metabolic
      pathway analysis revealed that the differentially phosphorylated proteins were
      involved in signal transduction, protein modification, carbohydrate metabolic
      processes, and cell cycle and cell proliferation. Conclusions: Our
      phosphoproteomics-based research provides the first global overview of
      phosphorylation during cotton fiber initiation, and also offers a helpful dataset
      for elucidation of signaling networks in fiber development of G. hirsutum.

TI  - Discovering pathway cross-talks based on functional relations between pathways.
PG  - S25
AB  - Background: In biological systems, pathways coordinate or interact with one
      another to achieve a complex biological process. Studying how they influence each
      other is essential for understanding the intricacies of a biological system.
      However, current methods rely on statistical tests to determine pathway
      relations, and may lose numerous biologically significant relations. Results:
      This study proposes a method that identifies the pathway relations by measuring
      the functional relations between pathways based on the Gene Ontology (GO)
      annotations. This approach identified 4,661 pathway relations among 166 pathways 
      from Pathway Interaction Database (PID). Using 143 pathway interactions from PID 
      as testing data, the function-based approach (FBA) is able to identify 93% of
      pathway interactions, better than the existing methods based on the shared
      components and protein-protein interactions. Many well-known pathway cross-talks 
      are only identified by FBA. In addition, the false positive rate of FBA is
      significantly lower than others via pathway co-expression analysis. Conclusions: 
      This function-based approach appears to be more sensitive and able to infer more 
      biologically significant and explainable pathway relations.

TI  - Multiple platform assessment of the EGF dependent transcriptome by microarray and
      deep tag sequencing analysis.
PG  - 326
AB  - Background: Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a key regulatory growth factor
      activating many processes relevant to normal development and disease, affecting
      cell proliferation and survival. Here we use a combined approach to study the EGF
      dependent transcriptome of HeLa cells by using multiple long oligonucleotide
      based microarray platforms (from Agilent, Operon, and Illumina) in combination
      with digital gene expression profiling (DGE) with the Illumina Genome Analyzer.
      Results: By applying a procedure for cross-platform data meta-analysis based on
      RankProd and GlobalAncova tests, we establish a well validated gene set with
      transcript levels altered after EGF treatment. We use this robust gene list to
      build higher order networks of gene interaction by interconnecting associated
      networks, supporting and extending the important role of the EGF signaling
      pathway in cancer. In addition, we find an entirely new set of genes previously
      unrelated to the currently accepted EGF associated cellular functions.
      Conclusions: We propose that the use of global genomic cross-validation derived
      from high content technologies (microarrays or deep sequencing) can be used to
      generate more reliable datasets. This approach should help to improve the
      confidence of downstream in silico functional inference analyses based on high
      content data.

TI  - Causal reasoning identifies mechanisms of sensitivity for a novel AKT kinase
      inhibitor, GSK690693.
PG  - 419
AB  - Background: Inappropriate activation of AKT signaling is a relatively common
      occurrence in human tumors, and can be caused by activation of components of, or 
      by loss or decreased activity of inhibitors of, this signaling pathway. A novel, 
      pan AKT kinase inhibitor, GSK690693, was developed in order to interfere with the
      inappropriate AKT signaling seen in these human malignancies. Causal network
      modeling is a systematic computational analysis that identifies upstream changes 
      in gene regulation that can serve as explanations for observed changes in gene
      expression. In this study, causal network modeling is employed to elucidate
      mechanisms of action of GSK690693 that contribute to its observed biological
      effects. The mechanism of action of GSK690693 was evaluated in multiple human
      tumor cell lines from different tissues in 2-D cultures and xenografts using RNA 
      expression and phosphoproteomics data. Understanding the molecular mechanism of
      action of novel targeted agents can enhance our understanding of various
      biological processes regulated by the intended target and facilitate their
      clinical development. Results: Causal network modeling on transcriptomic and
      proteomic data identified molecular networks that are comprised of activated or
      inhibited mechanisms that could explain observed changes in the sensitive cell
      lines treated with GSK690693. Four networks common to all cell lines and
      xenografts tested were identified linking GSK690693 inhibition of AKT kinase
      activity to decreased proliferation. These networks included increased RB1
      activity, decreased MYC activity, decreased TFRC activity, and increased
      FOXO1/FOXO3 activity. Conclusion: AKT is involved in regulating both cell
      proliferation and apoptotic pathways; however, the primary effect with GSK690693 
      appears to be anti-proliferative in the cell lines and xenografts evaluated.
      Furthermore, these results indicate that anti-proliferative responses to
      GSK690693 in either 2-D culture or xenograft models may share common mechanisms
      within and across sensitive cell lines.

TI  - Expression-based and co-localization detection of arabinogalactan protein 6 and
      arabinogalactan protein 11 interactors in Arabidopsis pollen and pollen tubes.
PG  - 7
AB  - Background: Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are cell wall proteoglycans that have
      been shown to be important for pollen development. An Arabidopsis double null
      mutant for two pollen-specific AGPs (agp6 agp11) showed reduced pollen tube
      growth and compromised response to germination cues in vivo. A microarray
      experiment was performed on agp6 agp11 pollen tubes to search for genetic
      interactions in the context of pollen tube growth. A yeast two-hybrid experiment 
      for AGP6 and AGP11 was also designed. Results: The lack of two specific AGPs
      induced a meaningful shift in the gene expression profile. In fact, a high number
      of genes showed altered expression levels, strengthening the case that AGP6 and
      AGP11 are involved in complex phenomena. The expression levels of calcium- and
      signaling-related genes were found to be altered, supporting the known roles of
      the respective proteins in pollen tube growth. Although the precise nature of the
      proposed interactions needs further investigation, the putative involvement of
      AGPs in signaling cascades through calmodulin and protein degradation via
      ubiquitin was indicated. The expression of stress-, as well as signaling-
      related, genes was also changed; a correlation that may result from the
      recognized similarities between signaling pathways in both defense and pollen
      tube growth.The results of yeast two-hybrid experiments lent further support to
      these signaling pathways and revealed putative AGP6 and AGP11 interactors
      implicated in recycling of cell membrane components via endocytosis, through
      clathrin-mediated endosomes and multivesicular bodies. Conclusions: The data
      presented suggest the involvement of AGP6 and AGP11 in multiple signaling
      pathways, in particular those involved in developmental processes such as
      endocytosis-mediated plasma membrane remodeling during Arabidopsis pollen
      development. This highlights the importance of endosomal trafficking pathways
      which are rapidly emerging as fundamental regulators of the wall physiology.

AB  - Background: Mathematical/computational models are needed to understand cell
      signaling networks, which are complex. Signaling proteins contain multiple
      functional components and multiple sites of post-translational modification. The 
      multiplicity of components and sites of modification ensures that interactions
      among signaling proteins have the potential to generate myriad protein complexes 
      and post-translational modification states. As a result, the number of chemical
      species that can be populated in a cell signaling network, and hence the number
      of equations in an ordinary differential equation model required to capture the
      dynamics of these species, is prohibitively large. To overcome this problem, the 
      rule-based modeling approach has been developed for representing interactions
      within signaling networks efficiently and compactly through coarse-graining of
      the chemical kinetics of molecular interactions. Results: Here, we provide a
      demonstration that the rule-based modeling approach can be used to specify and
      simulate a large model for ERBB receptor signaling that accounts for
      site-specific details of protein-protein interactions. The model is considered
      large because it corresponds to a reaction network containing more reactions than
      can be practically enumerated. The model encompasses activation of ERK and Akt,
      and it can be simulated using a network-free simulator, such as NFsim, to
      generate time courses of phosphorylation for 55 individual serine, threonine, and
      tyrosine residues. The model is annotated and visualized in the form of an
      extended contact map. Conclusions: With the development of software that
      implements novel computational methods for calculating the dynamics of
      large-scale rule-based representations of cellular signaling networks, it is now 
      possible to build and analyze models that include a significant fraction of the
      protein interactions that comprise a signaling network, with incorporation of the
      site-specific details of the interactions. Modeling at this level of detail is
      important for understanding cellular signaling.
