TI  - ROSICS: CHEMISTRY AND PROTEOMICS OF CYSTEINE MODIFICATIONS IN REDOX BIOLOGY.
PG  - 184-208
AB  - Post-translational modifications (PTMs) occurring in proteins determine their
      functions and regulations. Proteomic tools are available to identify PTMs and
      have proved invaluable to expanding the inventory of these tools of nature that
      hold the keys to biological processes. Cysteine (Cys), the least abundant (1–2%) 
      of amino acid residues, are unique in that they play key roles in maintaining
      stability of protein structure, participating in active sites of enzymes,
      regulating protein function and binding to metals, among others. Cys residues are
      major targets of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are important mediators and
      modulators of various biological processes. It is therefore necessary to identify
      the Cys-containing ROS target proteins, as well as the sites and species of their
      PTMs. Cutting edge proteomic tools which have helped identify the PTMs at
      reactive Cys residues, have also revealed that Cys residues are modified in
      numerous ways. These modifications include formation of disulfide, thiosulfinate 
      and thiosulfonate, oxidation to sulfenic, sulfinic, sulfonic acids and
      thiosulfonic acid, transformation to dehydroalanine (DHA) and serine,
      palmitoylation and farnesylation, formation of chemical adducts with glutathione,
      4-hydroxynonenal and 15-deoxy PGJ2, and various other chemicals. We present here,
      a review of relevant ROS biology, possible chemical reactions of Cys residues and
      details of the proteomic strategies employed for rapid, efficient and sensitive
      identification of diverse and novel PTMs involving reactive Cys residues of
      redox-sensitive proteins. We propose a new name, “ROSics,” for the science which 
      describes the principles of mode of action of ROS at molecular levels. © 2014 The

TI  - Delineation of a Conserved Arrestin-Biased Signaling Repertoire In Vivo.
PG  - 706-17
AB  - Biased G protein–coupled receptor agonists engender a restricted repertoire of
      downstream events from their cognate receptors, permitting them to produce mixed 
      agonist-antagonist effects in vivo. While this opens the possibility of novel
      therapeutics, it complicates rational drug design, since the in vivo response to 
      a biased agonist cannot be reliably predicted from its in cellula efficacy. We
      have employed novel informatic approaches to characterize the in vivo
      transcriptomic signature of the arrestin pathway-selective parathyroid hormone
      analog [d-Trp12, Tyr34]bovine PTH(7-34) in six different murine tissues after
      chronic drug exposure. We find that [d-Trp12, Tyr34]bovine PTH(7-34) elicits a
      distinctive arrestin-signaling focused transcriptomic response that is more
      coherently regulated across tissues than that of the pluripotent agonist, human
      PTH(1-34). This arrestin-focused network is closely associated with
      transcriptional control of cell growth and development. Our demonstration of a
      conserved arrestin-dependent transcriptomic signature suggests a framework within
      which the in vivo outcomes of arrestin-biased signaling may be generalized.

TI  - Differential Reprogramming of Isogenic Colorectal Cancer Cells by Distinct
      Activating KRAS Mutations.
PG  - 1535-46
AB  - Oncogenic mutations of Ras at codons 12, 13, or 61, that render the protein
      constitutively active, are found in ∼16% of all cancer cases. Among the three
      major Ras isoforms, KRAS is the most frequently mutated isoform in cancer. Each
      Ras isoform and tumor type displays a distinct pattern of codon-specific
      mutations. In colon cancer, KRAS is typically mutated at codon 12, but a
      significant fraction of patients have mutations at codon 13. Clinical data
      suggest different outcomes and responsiveness to treatment between these two
      groups. To investigate the differential effects upon cell status associated with 
      KRAS mutations we performed a quantitative analysis of the proteome and
      phosphoproteome of isogenic SW48 colon cancer cell lines in which one allele of
      the endogenous gene has been edited to harbor specific KRAS mutations (G12V,
      G12D, or G13D). Each mutation generates a distinct signature, with the most
      variability seen between G13D and the codon 12 KRAS mutants. One notable example 
      of specific up-regulation in KRAS codon 12 mutant SW48 cells is provided by the
      short form of the colon cancer stem cell marker doublecortin-like Kinase 1
      (DCLK1) that can be reversed by suppression of KRAS.

TI  - Identification of Caveolar Resident Proteins in Ventricular Myocytes Using a
      Quantitative Proteomic Approach: Dynamic Changes in Caveolar Composition
      Following Adrenoceptor Activation*.
PG  - 596-608
AB  - The lipid raft concept proposes that membrane environments enriched in
      cholesterol and sphingolipids cluster certain proteins and form platforms to
      integrate cell signaling. In cardiac muscle, caveolae concentrate signaling
      molecules and ion transporters, and play a vital role in adrenergic regulation of
      excitation–contraction coupling, and consequently cardiac contractility.
      Proteomic analysis of cardiac caveolae is hampered by the presence of
      contaminants that have sometimes, erroneously, been proposed to be resident in
      these domains. Here we present the first unbiased analysis of the proteome of
      cardiac caveolae, and investigate dynamic changes in their protein constituents
      following adrenoreceptor (AR) stimulation.Rat ventricular myocytes were treated
      with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) to deplete cholesterol and disrupt caveolae.
      Buoyant caveolin-enriched microdomains (BCEMs) were prepared from MβCD-treated
      and control cell lysates using a standard discontinuous sucrose gradient. BCEMs
      were harvested, pelleted, and resolubilized, then alkylated, digested, and
      labeled with iTRAQ reagents, and proteins identified by LC-MS/MS on a LTQ
      Orbitrap Velos Pro. Proteins were defined as BCEM resident if they were
      consistently depleted from the BCEM fraction following MβCD treatment. Selective 
      activation of α-, β1-, and β2-AR prior to preparation of BCEMs was achieved by
      application of agonist/antagonist pairs for 10 min in populations of
      field-stimulated myocytes.We typically identified 600–850 proteins per
      experiment, of which, 249 were defined as high-confidence BCEM residents.
      Functional annotation clustering indicates cardiac BCEMs are enriched in integrin
      signaling, guanine nucleotide binding, ion transport, and insulin signaling
      clusters. Proteins possessing a caveolin binding motif were poorly enriched in
      BCEMs, suggesting this is not the only mechanism that targets proteins to
      caveolae. With the notable exception of the cavin family, very few proteins show 
      altered abundance in BCEMs following AR activation, suggesting signaling
      complexes are preformed in BCEMs to ensure a rapid and high fidelity response to 
      adrenergic stimulation in cardiac muscle.

TI  - A crowd-sourcing approach for the construction of species-specific cell signaling
      networks.
PG  - 484-91
AB  - Motivation: Animal models are important tools in drug discovery and for
      understanding human biology in general. However, many drugs that initially show
      promising results in rodents fail in later stages of clinical trials.
      Understanding the commonalities and differences between human and rat cell
      signaling networks can lead to better experimental designs, improved allocation
      of resources and ultimately better drugs.Results: The sbv IMPROVER
      Species-Specific Network Inference challenge was designed to use the power of the
      crowds to build two species-specific cell signaling networks given
      phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics and cytokine data generated from NHBE and NRBE
      cells exposed to various stimuli. A common literature-inspired reference network 
      with 220 nodes and 501 edges was also provided as prior knowledge from which
      challenge participants could add or remove edges but not nodes. Such a large
      network inference challenge not based on synthetic simulations but on real data
      presented unique difficulties in scoring and interpreting the results. Because
      any prior knowledge about the networks was already provided to the participants
      for reference, novel ways for scoring and aggregating the results were developed.
      Two human and rat consensus networks were obtained by combining all the inferred 
      networks. Further analysis showed that major signaling pathways were conserved
      between the two species with only isolated components diverging, as in the case
      of ribosomal S6 kinase RPS6KA1. Overall, the consensus between inferred edges was
      relatively high with the exception of the downstream targets of transcription
      factors, which seemed more difficult to predict.Contact:ebilal@us.ibm.com or

TI  - Understanding the limits of animal models as predictors of human biology: lessons
      learned from the sbv IMPROVER Species Translation Challenge.
PG  - 471-83
AB  - Motivation: Inferring how humans respond to external cues such as drugs,
      chemicals, viruses or hormones is an essential question in biomedicine. Very
      often, however, this question cannot be addressed because it is not possible to
      perform experiments in humans. A reasonable alternative consists of generating
      responses in animal models and ‘translating’ those results to humans. The
      limitations of such translation, however, are far from clear, and systematic
      assessments of its actual potential are urgently needed. sbv IMPROVER (systems
      biology verification for Industrial Methodology for PROcess VErification in
      Research) was designed as a series of challenges to address translatability
      between humans and rodents. This collaborative crowd-sourcing initiative invited 
      scientists from around the world to apply their own computational methodologies
      on a multilayer systems biology dataset composed of phosphoproteomics,
      transcriptomics and cytokine data derived from normal human and rat bronchial
      epithelial cells exposed in parallel to 52 different stimuli under identical
      conditions. Our aim was to understand the limits of species-to-species
      translatability at different levels of biological organization: signaling,
      transcriptional and release of secreted factors (such as cytokines).
      Participating teams submitted 49 different solutions across the sub-challenges,
      two-thirds of which were statistically significantly better than random.
      Additionally, similar computational methods were found to range widely in their
      performance within the same challenge, and no single method emerged as a clear
      winner across all sub-challenges. Finally, computational methods were able to
      effectively translate some specific stimuli and biological processes in the lung 
      epithelial system, such as DNA synthesis, cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, 
      translation, immune/inflammation and growth factor/proliferation pathways, better
      than the expected response similarity between species.Contact:pmeyerr@us.ibm.com

TI  - Inter-species prediction of protein phosphorylation in the sbv IMPROVER species
      translation challenge.
PG  - 453-61
AB  - Motivation: Animal models are widely used in biomedical research for reasons
      ranging from practical to ethical. An important issue is whether rodent models
      are predictive of human biology. This has been addressed recently in the
      framework of a series of challenges designed by the systems biology verification 
      for Industrial Methodology for Process Verification in Research (sbv IMPROVER)
      initiative. In particular, one of the sub-challenges was devoted to the
      prediction of protein phosphorylation responses in human bronchial epithelial
      cells, exposed to a number of different chemical stimuli, given the responses in 
      rat bronchial epithelial cells. Participating teams were asked to make
      inter-species predictions on the basis of available training examples, comprising
      transcriptomics and phosphoproteomics data.Results: Here, the two best performing
      teams present their data-driven approaches and computational methods. In
      addition, post hoc analyses of the datasets and challenge results were performed 
      by the participants and challenge organizers. The challenge outcome indicates
      that successful prediction of protein phosphorylation status in human based on
      rat phosphorylation levels is feasible. However, within the limitations of the
      computational tools used, the inclusion of gene expression data does not improve 
      the prediction quality. The post hoc analysis of time-specific measurements sheds
      light on the signaling pathways in both species.Availability and implementation: 
      A detailed description of the dataset, challenge design and outcome is available 
      at www.sbvimprover.com. The code used by team IGB is provided under
      http://github.com/uci-igb/improver2013. Implementations of the algorithms applied
      by team AMG are available at

TI  - A novel therapeutic effect of statins on nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
PG  - 265-82
AB  - Statins competitively inhibit hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A
      reductase, resulting in reduced plasma total and low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol levels. Recently, it has been shown that statins exert additional
      ‘pleiotropic’ effects by increasing expression levels of the membrane water
      channels aquaporin 2 (AQP2). AQP2 is localized mainly in the kidney and plays a
      critical role in determining cellular water content. This additional effect is
      independent of cholesterol homoeostasis, and depends on depletion of
      mevalonate-derived intermediates of sterol synthetic pathways, i.e.
      farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. By up-regulating the
      expression levels of AQP2, statins increase water reabsorption by the kidney,
      thus opening up a new avenue in treating patients with nephrogenic diabetes
      insipidus (NDI), a hereditary disease that yet lacks high-powered and limited
      side effects therapy. Aspects related to water balance determined by AQP2 in the 
      kidney, as well as standard and novel therapeutic strategies of NDI are
      discussed.

TI  - Small molecule inhibition of group I p21-activated kinases in breast cancer
      induces apoptosis and potentiates the activity of microtubule stabilizing agents.
LID - 59
AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer, the most common cause of cancer-related deaths
      worldwide among women, is a molecularly and clinically heterogeneous disease.
      Extensive genetic and epigenetic profiling of breast tumors has recently revealed
      novel putative driver genes, including p21-activated kinase (PAK)1. PAK1 is a
      serine/threonine kinase downstream of small GTP-binding proteins, Rac1 and Cdc42,
      and is an integral component of growth factor signaling networks and cellular
      functions fundamental to tumorigenesis. Methods: PAK1 dysregulation (copy number 
      gain, mRNA and protein expression) was evaluated in two cohorts of breast cancer 
      tissues (n = 980 and 1,108). A novel small molecule inhibitor, FRAX1036, and RNA 
      interference were used to examine PAK1 loss of function and combination with
      docetaxel in vitro. Mechanism of action for the therapeutic combination, both
      cellular and molecular, was assessed via time-lapse microscopy and
      immunoblotting. Results: We demonstrate that focal genomic amplification and
      overexpression of PAK1 are associated with poor clinical outcome in the luminal
      subtype of breast cancer (P = 1.29 × 10−4 and P = 0.015, respectively). Given the
      role for PAK1 in regulating cytoskeletal organization, we hypothesized that
      combination of PAK1 inhibition with taxane treatment could be combined to further
      interfere with microtubule dynamics and cell survival. Consistent with this,
      administration of docetaxel with either a novel small molecule inhibitor of group
      I PAKs, FRAX1036, or PAK1 small interfering RNA oligonucleotides dramatically
      altered signaling to cytoskeletal-associated proteins, such as stathmin, and
      induced microtubule disorganization and cellular apoptosis. Live-cell imaging
      revealed that the duration of mitotic arrest mediated by docetaxel was
      significantly reduced in the presence of FRAX1036, and this was associated with
      increased kinetics of apoptosis. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings
      further support PAK1 as a potential target in breast cancer and suggest
      combination with taxanes as a viable strategy to increase anti-tumor efficacy.

TI  - Role of Rebiopsy in Relapsed Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer for Directing Oncology
      Treatments.
LID - 809835
AB  - Background. Currently, few rebiopsies are performed in relapses of advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer. They are not customary in clinical practice of lung
      cancer. However, it is not possible to properly target treatments in cases of
      relapse without knowing the nature of new lesions. Design. This paper
      comprehensively summarizes the available literature about rebiopsy and broadly
      discusses the importance of rebiopsy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
      Results. Altogether 560 abstracts were used as material for further analysis. 19 
      articles were about clinical rebiopsy in lung cancer and were reviewed in
      detailed manner. Conclusions. This review shows that rebiopsy is feasible in
      non-small cell lung cancer, and success rates can be high if rebiopsy is
      accompanied by adequate evaluation before biopsy. Its use may resolve the
      difficulties in sampling bias and detecting changes in cancer characteristics. In
      cases where treatment was selected based on tissue characteristics that then
      change, the treatment selection process must be repeated while considering new
      characteristics of the tumor. Rebiopsy may be used to predict therapeutic
      resistance and consequently redirect targeted therapies. Such knowledge may
      resolve the difficulties in sampling bias and also in selecting preexisting
      clones or formulating drug-resistant ones. Rebiopsy should be performed more
      often in non-small cell lung cancer.

TI  - A phosphoproteomic screen demonstrates differential dependence on HER3 for MAP
      kinase pathway activation by distinct PIK3CA mutations.
PG  - 318-26
AB  - The PIK3CA gene encodes for the p110 alpha isoform of PI3 kinase and is one of
      the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers. However, the mechanisms
      by which PIK3CA mutations activate cell signaling are not fully understood. Here 
      we used a phosphoproteomic approach to compare differential phosphorylation
      patterns between human breast epithelial cells and two isogenic somatic cell
      knock in derivatives, each harboring a distinct PIK3CA mutation. We demonstrated 
      differential phosphorylation patterns between isogenic cell lines containing a
      PIK3CA helical domain mutation (E545K) compared to cells with a PIK3CA kinase
      domain mutation (H1047R). In particular, the receptor tyrosine kinase, HER3,
      showed increased phosphorylation at tyrosine 1328 in H1047R cells versus E545K
      cells. Genetic studies using shRNA demonstrated that H1047R cells have a profound
      decrease in growth factor independent proliferation upon HER3 knock down, but
      this effect was attenuated in E545K cells. In addition, HER3 knock down led to
      reductions in both PI3 kinase and MAP kinase pathway activation in H1047R cells, 
      but in E545K cells only PI3 kinase pathway diminution was observed. These studies
      demonstrate the power of using paired isogenic cell lines for proteomic analysis 
      to gain new insights into oncogenic signal transduction pathways.

TI  - Mapping the route from naive pluripotency to lineage specification.
LID - 20130540
AB  - In the mouse blastocyst, epiblast cells are newly formed shortly before
      implantation. They possess a unique developmental plasticity, termed naive
      pluripotency. For development to proceed, this naive state must be subsumed by
      multi-lineage differentiation within 72 h following implantation. In vitro
      differentiation of naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in controlled
      conditions provides a tractable system to dissect and understand the process of
      exit from naive pluripotency and entry into lineage specification. Exploitation
      of this system in recent large-scale RNAi and mutagenesis screens has uncovered
      multiple new factors and modules that drive or facilitate progression out of the 
      naive state. Notably, these studies show that the transcription factor network
      that governs the naive state is rapidly dismantled prior to upregulation of
      lineage specification markers, creating an intermediate state that we term
      formative pluripotency. Here, we summarize these findings and propose a road map 
      for state transitions in ESC differentiation that reflects the orderly dynamics
      of epiblast progression in the embryo.

TI  - GENE DOPING IN SPORT – PERSPECTIVES AND RISKS.
PG  - 251-9
AB  - In the past few years considerable progress regarding the knowledge of the human 
      genome map has been achieved. As a result, attempts to use gene therapy in
      patients’ management are more and more often undertaken. The aim of gene therapy 
      is to replace defective genes in vivo and/or to promote the long-term endogenous 
      synthesis of deficient protein. In vitro studies improve the production of human 
      recombinant proteins, such as insulin (INS), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like
      growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and erythropoietin (EPO), which could have therapeutic
      application. Unfortunately, genetic methods developed for therapeutic purposes
      are increasingly being used in competitive sports. Some new substances (e.g.,
      antibodies against myostatin or myostatin blockers) might be used in gene doping 
      in athletes. The use of these substances may cause an increase of body weight and
      muscle mass and a significant improvement of muscle strength. Although it is
      proven that uncontrolled manipulation of genetic material and/or the introduction
      of recombinant proteins may be associated with health risks, athletes are
      increasingly turning to banned gene doping. At the same time, anti-doping
      research is undertaken in many laboratories around the world to try to develop
      and refine ever newer techniques for gene doping detection in sport. Thanks to
      the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and other sports organizations there is a
      hope for real protection of athletes from adverse health effects of gene doping, 
      which at the same time gives a chance to sustain the idea of fair play in sport.

TI  - Tissue phosphoproteomics with PolyMAC identifies potential therapeutic targets in
      a transgenic mouse model of HER2 positive breast cancer.
PG  - 3463-9
AB  - Altered protein phosphorylation is a feature of many human cancers that can be
      targeted therapeutically. Phosphopeptide enrichment is a critical step for
      maximizing the depth of phosphoproteome coverage by MS, but remains challenging
      for tissue specimens because of their high complexity. We describe the first
      analysis of a tissue phosphoproteome using polymer-based metal ion affinity
      capture (PolyMAC), a nanopolymer that has excellent yield and specificity for
      phosphopeptide enrichment, on a transgenic mouse model of HER2-driven breast
      cancer. By combining phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation with PolyMAC, 411 unique
      peptides with 139 phosphotyrosine, 45 phosphoserine, and 29 phosphothreonine
      sites were identified from five LC-MS/MS runs. Combining reverse phase liquid
      chromatography fractionation at pH 8.0 with PolyMAC identified 1571 unique
      peptides with 1279 phosphoserine, 213 phosphothreonine, and 21 phosphotyrosine
      sites from eight LC-MS/MS runs. Linear motif analysis indicated that many of the 
      phosphosites correspond to well-known phosphorylation motifs. Analysis of the
      tyrosine phosphoproteome with the Drug Gene Interaction database uncovered a
      network of potential therapeutic targets centered on Src family kinases with
      inhibitors that are either FDA-approved or in clinical development. These results
      demonstrate that PolyMAC is well suited for phosphoproteomic analysis of tissue
      specimens.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteomics of Cytotoxic T Cells to Reveal Protein Kinase D 2 
      Regulated Networks*.
PG  - 3544-57
AB  - The focus of the present study was to characterize the phosphoproteome of
      cytotoxic T cells and to explore the role of the serine threonine kinase PKD2
      (Protein Kinase D2) in the phosphorylation networks of this key lymphocyte
      population. We used Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids in Culture (SILAC)
      combined with phosphopeptide enrichment and quantitative mass-spectrometry to
      determine the impact of PKD2 loss on the cytotoxic T cells phosphoproteome. We
      identified 15,871 phosphorylations on 3505 proteins in cytotoxic T cells. 450
      phosphosites on 281 proteins were down-regulated and 300 phosphosites on 196
      proteins were up-regulated in PKD2 null cytotoxic T cells. These data give
      valuable new insights about the protein phosphorylation networks operational in
      effector T cells and reveal that PKD2 regulates directly and indirectly about 5% 
      of the cytotoxic T-cell phosphoproteome. PKD2 candidate substrates identified in 
      this study include proteins involved in two distinct biological functions:
      regulation of protein sorting and intracellular vesicle trafficking, and control 
      of chromatin structure, transcription, and translation. In other cell types, PKD 
      substrates include class II histone deacetylases such as HDAC7 and actin
      regulatory proteins such as Slingshot. The current data show these are not PKD
      substrates in primary T cells revealing that the functional role of PKD isoforms 
      is different in different cell lineages.

TI  - Chk2 and REGγ-dependent DBC1 regulation in DNA damage induced apoptosis.
PG  - 13150-60
AB  - Human DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1; KIAA1967; CCAR2) is a protein implicated 
      in the regulation of apoptosis, transcription and histone modifications. Upon DNA
      damage, DBC1 is phosphorylated by ATM/ATR on Thr454 and this modification
      increases its inhibitory interaction with SIRT1, leading to p53 acetylation and
      p53-dependent apoptosis. Here, we report that the inhibition of SIRT1 by DBC1 in 
      the DNA damage response (DDR) also depends on Chk2, the transducer kinase that is
      activated by ATM upon DNA lesions and contributes to the spreading of DNA damage 
      signal. Indeed we found that inactivation of Chk2 reduces DBC1-SIRT1 binding,
      thus preventing p53 acetylation and DBC1-induced apoptosis. These events are
      mediated by Chk2 phosphorylation of the 11S proteasome activator REGγ on Ser247, 
      which increases REGγ-DBC1 interaction and SIRT1 inhibition. Overall our results
      clarify the mechanisms underlying the DBC1-dependent SIRT1 inhibition and link,
      for the first time, Chk2 and REGγ to the ATM-DBC1-SIRT1 axis.

TI  - hnRNPA1 couples nuclear export and translation of specific mRNAs downstream of
      FGF-2/S6K2 signalling.
PG  - 12483-97
AB  - The increased cap-independent translation of anti-apoptotic proteins is involved 
      in the development of drug resistance in lung cancer but signalling events
      regulating this are poorly understood. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2)
      signalling-induced S6 kinase 2 (S6K2) activation is necessary, but the downstream
      mediator(s) coupling this kinase to the translational response is unknown. Here, 
      we show that S6K2 binds and phosphorylates hnRNPA1 on novel Ser4/6 sites,
      increasing its association with BCL-XL and XIAP mRNAs to promote their nuclear
      export. In the cytoplasm, phosphoS4/6-hnRNPA1 dissociates from these mRNAs
      de-repressing their IRES-mediated translation. This correlates with the
      phosphorylation-dependent association of hnRNPA1 with 14-3-3 leading to hnRNPA1
      sumoylation on K183 and its re-import into the nucleus. A non-phosphorylatible,
      S4/6A mutant prevented these processes, hindering the pro-survival activity of
      FGF-2/S6K2 signalling. Interestingly, immunohistochemical staining of lung and
      breast cancer tissue samples demonstrated that increased S6K2 expression
      correlates with decreased cytoplasmic hnRNPA1 and increased BCL-XL expression. In
      short, phosphorylation on novel N-term sites of hnRNPA1 promotes translation of
      anti-apoptotic proteins and is indispensable for the pro-survival effects of
      FGF-2.

TI  - Fragile X spectrum disorders.
PG  - 134-46
AB  - The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1), which codes for the fragile X
      mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP), is located at Xp27.3. The normal allele of
      the FMR1 gene typically has 5 to 40 CGG repeats in the 5′ untranslated region;
      abnormal alleles of dynamic mutations include the full mutation (> 200 CGG
      repeats), premutation (55–200 CGG repeats) and the gray zone mutation (45–54 CGG 
      repeats). Premutation carriers are common in the general population with
      approximately 1 in 130–250 females and 1 in 250–810 males, whereas the full
      mutation and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) occur in approximately 1 in 4000 to 1 in
      7000. FMR1 mutations account for a variety of phenotypes including the most
      common monogenetic cause of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism
      (FXS), the most common genetic form of ovarian failure, the fragile X-associated 
      primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI, premutation); and fragile X-associated
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS, premutation). The premutation can also cause
      developmental problems including ASD and ADHD especially in boys and
      psychopathology including anxiety and depression in children and adults. Some
      premutation carriers can have a deficit of FMRP and some unmethylated full
      mutation individuals can have elevated FMR1 mRNA that is considered a premutation
      problem. Therefore the term “Fragile X Spectrum Disorder” (FXSD) should be used
      to include the wide range of overlapping phenotypes observed in affected
      individuals with FMR1 mutations. In this review we focus on the phenotypes and
      genotypes of children with FXSD.

TI  - Syk Interacts with and Phosphorylates Nucleolin To Stabilize Bcl-xL mRNA and
      Promote Cell Survival.
PG  - 3788-99
AB  - The Syk protein tyrosine kinase, a well-characterized regulator of immune cell
      function, plays an increasingly recognized role in tumorigenesis as a promoter of
      cell survival in both hematological and nonhematological malignancies. We show
      here that the expression of Syk in MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells or in
      DG75 B-lymphoma cells protects cells from apoptosis induced by oxidative or
      genotoxic stress by stabilizing the mRNA for Bcl-xL, an antiapoptotic protein.
      Syk binds robustly to nucleolin and phosphorylates it on tyrosine, enhancing its 
      ability to bind the Bcl-xL mRNA. Consequently, reducing the level of nucleolin by
      RNA interference attenuates the ability of Syk to protect cells from
      stress-induced cell death.

      features.
PG  - E4066-75
AB  - Cancer cells characteristically express proteins with immature O-glycosylation,
      but how and why cancer cells express immature O-glycans has remained poorly
      understood. Here, we report that one prevalent mechanism in pancreatic cancer is 
      epigenetic silencing, rather than somatic mutations in a key chaperone, core 1
      β3-Gal-T-specific molecular chaperone (COSMC), required for mature elongated
      O-glycosylation. We also demonstrate, with the use of well-defined cell systems
      generated by precise gene editing, that the aberrant O-glycophenotype by itself
      induces oncogenic features with enhanced growth and invasion. Our study suggests 
      that the characteristic aberrant O-glycophenotype is critical for the development
      and behavior of cancer and further provides support for immunotherapeutic
      strategies that target aberrant O-glycans.

TI  - EGFR phosphorylation of DCBLD2 recruits TRAF6 and stimulates AKT-promoted
      tumorigenesis.
PG  - 3741-56
AB  - Aberrant activation of EGFR in human cancers promotes tumorigenesis through
      stimulation of AKT signaling. Here, we determined that the discoidina
      neuropilin-like membrane protein DCBLD2 is upregulated in clinical specimens of
      glioblastomas and head and neck cancers (HNCs) and is required for
      EGFR-stimulated tumorigenesis. In multiple cancer cell lines, EGFR activated
      phosphorylation of tyrosine 750 (Y750) of DCBLD2, which is located within a
      recently identified binding motif for TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6).
      Consequently, phosphorylation of DCBLD2 Y750 recruited TRAF6, leading to
      increased TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and subsequent activation of AKT,
      thereby enhancing EGFR-driven tumorigenesis. Moreover, evaluation of patient
      samples of gliomas and HNCs revealed an association among EGFR activation, DCBLD2
      phosphorylation, and poor prognoses. Together, our findings uncover a pathway in 
      which DCBLD2 functions as a signal relay for oncogenic EGFR signaling to promote 
      tumorigenesis and suggest DCBLD2 and TRAF6 as potential therapeutic targets for
      human cancers that are associated with EGFR activation.

TI  - Targeting mTOR dependency in pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 1481-9
AB  - Objective: Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the
      Western world. Current chemotherapy regimens have modest survival benefit. Thus, 
      novel, effective therapies are required for treatment of this disease. Design:
      Activating KRAS mutation almost always drives pancreatic tumour initiation,
      however, deregulation of other potentially druggable pathways promotes tumour
      progression. PTEN loss leads to acceleration of KrasG12D-driven pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in mice and these tumours have high levels of mammalian
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. To test whether these KRAS PTEN pancreatic
      tumours show mTOR dependence, we compared response to mTOR inhibition in this
      model, to the response in another established model of pancreatic cancer, KRAS
      P53. We also assessed whether there was a subset of pancreatic cancer patients
      who may respond to mTOR inhibition. Results: We found that tumours in KRAS PTEN
      mice exhibit a remarkable dependence on mTOR signalling. In these tumours, mTOR
      inhibition leads to proliferative arrest and even tumour regression. Further, we 
      could measure response using clinically applicable positron emission tomography
      imaging. Importantly, pancreatic tumours driven by activated KRAS and mutant p53 
      did not respond to treatment. In human tumours, approximately 20% of cases
      demonstrated low PTEN expression and a gene expression signature that overlaps
      with murine KRAS PTEN tumours. Conclusions: KRAS PTEN tumours are uniquely
      responsive to mTOR inhibition. Targeted anti-mTOR therapies may offer clinical
      benefit in subsets of human PDAC selected based on genotype, that are dependent
      on mTOR signalling. Thus, the genetic signatures of human tumours could be used
      to direct pancreatic cancer treatment in the future.

TI  - Oncogene Mimicry as a Mechanism of Primary Resistance to BRAF Inhibitors.
PG  - 1037-48
AB  - Despite the development of potent RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      pathway inhibitors, only a fraction of BRAF-mutant patients benefit from
      treatment with these drugs. Using a combined chemogenomics and chemoproteomics
      approach, we identify drug-induced RAS-RAF-MEK complex formation in a subset of
      BRAF-mutant cancer cells characterized by primary resistance to vemurafenib. In
      these cells, autocrine interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion may contribute to the
      primary resistance phenotype via induction of JAK/STAT3 and MAPK signaling. In a 
      subset of cell lines, combined IL-6/MAPK inhibition is able to overcome primary
      resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy. Overall, we show that the signaling
      plasticity exerted by primary resistant BRAF-mutant cells is achieved by their
      ability to mimic signaling features of oncogenic RAS, a strategy that we term
      “oncogene mimicry.” This model may guide future strategies for overcoming primary
      resistance observed in these tumors.

TI  - Molecular modulation of the copper and cisplatin transport function of CTR1 and
      its interaction with IRS-4.
PG  - 379-87
AB  - The copper influx transporter CTR1 is also a major influx transporter for
      cisplatin (cDDP) in tumor cells. It influences the cytotoxicity of cDDP both in
      vivo and in vitro. Whereas Cu triggers internalization of CTR1 from the plasma
      membrane, cDDP does not. To investigate the mechanisms of these effects,
      myc-tagged forms of wild type hCTR1 and variants in which Y103 was converted to
      alanine, C189 was converted to serine, or the K178/K179 dilysine motif was
      converted to alanines were re-expressed in mouse embryo cells in which both
      alleles of CTR1 had been knocked out and also in HEK293T cells. The Y103A
      mutation and to a lesser extent the C189S mutation reduced internalization of
      CTR1 induced by Cu while the K178A/K179A had little effect. Both Y103 and C189
      were required for Cu and cDDP transport whereas the K178/K179 motif was not.
      While Y103 lies in an YXXM motif that, when phosphorylated, is a potential
      docking site for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and other proteins involved in
      endocytosis, Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated myc-CTR1, and proteomic 
      analysis of peptides derived from CTR1, failed to identify any basal or
      Cu-induced phosphorylation. However, proteomic analysis did identify an
      interaction of CTR1 with IRS-4 and this was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation
      from HEK cells expressing either FLAG-CTR1 or myc-CTR1. The interaction was
      greater in the Y103A-expressing cells. We conclude that Y103 is required for the 
      internalization of hCTR1 in response to Cu, that this occurs by a mechanism other
      than phosphorylation and that mutation of Y103 modulates the interaction with
      IRS-4.

TI  - Phosphorylation of nucleoporin Tpr governs its differential localization and is
      required for its mitotic function.
PG  - 3505-20
AB  - A major constituent of the nuclear basket region of the nuclear pore complex
      (NPC), nucleoporin Tpr, plays roles in regulating multiple important processes.
      We have previously established that Tpr is phosphorylated in both a
      MAP-kinase-dependent and MAP-kinase-independent manner, and that Tpr acts as both
      a substrate and as a scaffold for ERK2 (also known as MAPK1). Here, we report the
      identification of S2059 and S2094 as the major novel ERK-independent
      phosphorylation sites and T1677, S2020, S2023 and S2034 as additional
      ERK-independent phosphorylation sites found in the Tpr protein in vivo. Our
      results suggest that protein kinase A phosphorylates the S2094 residue and that
      the site is hyperphosphorylated during mitosis. Furthermore, we find that Tpr is 
      phosphorylated at the S2059 residue by CDK1 and the phosphorylated form
      distinctly localizes with chromatin during telophase. Abrogation of S2059
      phosphorylation abolishes the interaction of Tpr with Mad1, thus compromising the
      localization of both Mad1 and Mad2 proteins, resulting in cell cycle defects. The
      identification of novel phosphorylation sites on Tpr and the observations
      presented in this study allow better understanding of Tpr functions.

AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls cell growth and
      metabolism in response to nutrients, growth factors, and cellular energy.
      Aberrant mTORC1 signaling is implicated in human diseases such as diabetes,
      obesity, and cancer. Our results reveal that ectopic mTORC1 activation in the
      liver controls the stress hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in a
      peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α)–dependent
      manner via glutamine depletion, which in turn affects whole-body behavior and
      metabolism. mTORC1 signaling correlates with FGF21 expression in human liver
      tumors, suggesting that our findings in mice may have physiological relevance in 
      glutamine-addicted human cancers. Thus, treatment with the anticancer drug
      rapamycin may have beneficial effects by blocking tumor growth and by preventing 
      deregulation of whole-body physiology due to FGF21 expression.

TI  - PZR Coordinates Shp2 Noonan and LEOPARD Syndrome Signaling in Zebrafish and Mice.
PG  - 2874-89
AB  - Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by activating
      mutations in the PTPN11 gene encoding Shp2, which manifests in congenital heart
      disease, short stature, and facial dysmorphia. The complexity of Shp2 signaling
      is exemplified by the observation that LEOPARD syndrome (LS) patients possess
      inactivating PTPN11 mutations yet exhibit similar symptoms to NS. Here, we
      identify “protein zero-related” (PZR), a transmembrane glycoprotein that
      interfaces with the extracellular matrix to promote cell migration, as a major
      hyper-tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein in mouse and zebrafish models of NS and LS. 
      PZR hyper-tyrosyl phosphorylation is facilitated in a phosphatase-independent
      manner by enhanced Src recruitment to NS and LS Shp2. In zebrafish, PZR
      overexpression recapitulated NS and LS phenotypes. PZR was required for zebrafish
      gastrulation in a manner dependent upon PZR tyrosyl phosphorylation. Hence, we
      identify PZR as an NS and LS target. Enhanced PZR-mediated membrane recruitment
      of Shp2 serves as a common mechanism to direct overlapping pathophysiological
      characteristics of these PTPN11 mutations.

TI  - Phosphoproteomic analysis identifies the tumor suppressor PDCD4 as a RSK
      substrate negatively regulated by 14-3-3.
PG  - E2918-27
AB  - The RSK family is a group of Ser/Thr kinases that promotes cell growth and
      proliferation in response to the Ras/MAPK pathway. Deregulated RSK activity has
      been associated with different disorders and diseases, such as cancer, but
      relatively little is known regarding the contribution of RSK to tumorigenesis. In
      this study, we describe, to our knowledge, the first global quantitative
      phosphoproteomic screen to characterize RSK-dependent signaling events in
      melanoma. Our results show that RSK negatively regulates the tumor suppressor
      PDCD4 by promoting its association to 14-3-3 proteins and subsequent proteasomal 
      degradation. These findings further implicate RSK as a promising therapeutic
      target for the treatment of melanoma and suggest that RSK plays widespread
      biological functions downstream of the Ras/MAPK pathway.

PG  - 1239-46
AB  - There are important breakthroughs in the treatment of paediatric acute
      lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) since 1950, by which the prognosis of the child
      majority suffered from ALL has been improved. However, there are urgent needs to 
      have disease-specific biomarkers to monitor the therapeutic efficacy and predict 
      the patient prognosis. The present study overviewed proteomics-based research on 
      paediatric ALL to discuss important advances to combat cancer cells and search
      novel and real protein biomarkers of resistance or sensitivity to drugs which
      target the signalling networks. We highlighted the importance and significance of
      a proper phospho-quantitative design and strategy for paediatric ALL between
      relapse and remission, when human body fluids from cerebrospinal, peripheral
      blood, or bone-marrow were applied. The present article also assessed the
      schedule for the analysis of body fluids from patients at different states,
      importance of proteomics-based tools to discover ALL-specific and sensitive
      biomarkers, to stimulate paediatric ALL research via proteomics to ‘build’ the
      reference map of the signalling networks from leukemic cells at relapse, and to
      monitor significant clinical therapies for ALL-relapse.

TI  - Integrating canonical and metabolic signalling programmes in the regulation of T 
      cell responses.
PG  - 435-46
AB  - Over the past decade, our understanding of T cell activation, differentiation and
      function has markedly expanded, providing a greater appreciation of the signals
      and pathways that regulate these processes. It has become clear that
      evolutionarily conserved pathways that regulate stress responses, metabolism,
      autophagy and survival have crucial and specific roles in regulating T cell
      responses. Recent studies suggest that the metabolic pathways involving MYC,
      hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are activated upon antigen recognition and
      that they are required for directing the consequences of T cell receptor
      engagement. The purpose of this Review is to provide an integrated view of the
      role of these metabolic pathways and of canonical T cell signalling pathways in
      regulating the outcome of T cell responses.

TI  - Discoidin domain receptor 2 signaling networks and therapy in lung cancer.
PG  - 900-4
AB  - Discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) is an atypical receptor tyrosine kinase that
      binds to and is activated by collagen in the extracellular matrix. Recent exon
      sequencing studies have identified DDR2 to be mutated with a 3-4% incidence in
      squamous cell cancers (SCCs) of the lung. This article summarizes the current
      state of knowledge of DDR2 biology and signaling in lung SCC. It also explores
      the context-dependent role of this receptor as both an oncogene and a tumor
      suppressor in cancer cells. Promising therapeutic opportunities based on existing
      and novel targeted small molecule inhibitors against DDR2 may provide new
      strategies for treating lung SCC patients.

      cancer relapse and metastasis and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)/chemokine
      (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) is a key regulator of tumor dissemination. We
      report a large-scale quantification of SDF-1/CXCR4–induced phosphoproteome events
      and identify several previously unidentified phosphoproteins and signaling
      pathways in breast CSCs. This study provides insights into the understanding of
      the mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis.

TI  - Molecular Pathways: Adaptive Kinome Reprogramming in Response to Targeted
      Inhibition of the BRAF-MEK-ERK Pathway in Cancer.
PG  - 2516-22
AB  - The central role of the BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway in controlling cell fate has made
      this pathway a primary target for deregulated activation in cancer. BRaf is
      activated by Ras proteins allowing Ras oncogenes to constitutively activate the
      pathway. Activating BRaf mutations are also frequent in several cancers, being
      the most common oncogenic mutation in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma. There are
      currently two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, approved for treatment of
      malignant melanoma having activating BRaf mutations. Concurrent administration of
      BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor (trametinib) is significantly more active in
      patients with BRAF mutant melanoma than either single agent alone, but
      progression to resistance ultimately occurs by different mechanisms that increase
      the activation of ERK. Such adaptive changes in tumor cell signaling networks
      allows bypass of targeted oncoprotein inhibition. This is true with targeted
      inhibitors for BRaf and MEK as well as specific inhibitors for AKT, mTOR and many
      receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and HER2. It is this adaptive response to 
      targeted kinase inhibitors that contributes to the failure of single agent kinase
      inhibitors to have durable responses. This failure is seen in virtually all
      cancers treated with single agent kinase inhibitors, most of which are not as
      dependent on a single signaling pathway such as BRaf-MEK-ERK in melanoma. Thus,
      understanding the breadth of adaptive reprogramming responses to specific
      targeted kinase inhibition will be critical to develop appropriate combination
      therapies for durable clinical responses.

TI  - Both Decreased and Increased SRPK1 Levels Promote Cancer by Interfering with
      PHLPP-Mediated Dephosphorylation of Akt.
PG  - 378-91
AB  - Akt activation is a hallmark of human cancers. Here we report a critical
      mechanism for regulation of Akt activity by the splicing kinase SRPK1, a
      downstream Akt target for transducing growth signals to regulate splicing.
      Surprisingly, we find that SRPK1 has a tumor suppressor function because ablation
      of SRPK1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts induces cell transformation. We link the 
      phenotype to constitutive Akt activation from genome-wide phosphoproteomics
      analysis and discover that down-regulated SRPK1 impairs the recruitment of the
      Akt phosphatase PHLPP1 to Akt. Interestingly, SRPK1 overexpression is also
      tumorigenic because excess SRPK1 squelches PHLPP1. Thus, aberrant SRPK1
      expression in either direction induces constitutive Akt activation, providing a
      mechanistic basis for previous observations that SRPK1 is down-regulated in some 
      cancer contexts and up-regulated in others.

TI  - Global Phosphoproteomic Profiling Reveals Distinct Signatures in B-Cell
      Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas.
PG  - 1331-42
AB  - Deregulation of signaling pathways controlled by protein phosphorylation
      underlies the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies; however, the extent to 
      which deregulated phosphorylation may be involved in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
      (B-NHL) pathogenesis is largely unknown. To identify phosphorylation events
      important in B-NHLs, we performed mass spectrometry–based, label-free,
      semiquantitative phosphoproteomic profiling of 11 cell lines derived from three
      B-NHL categories: Burkitt lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle-cell
      lymphoma. In all, 6579 unique phosphopeptides, corresponding to 1701 unique
      phosphorylated proteins, were identified and quantified. The data are available
      via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000658. Hierarchical clustering
      highlighted distinct phosphoproteomic signatures associated with each lymphoma
      subtype. Interestingly, germinal center–derived B-NHL cell lines were
      characterized by phosphorylation of proteins involved in the B-cell receptor
      signaling. Of these proteins, phosphoprotein associated with
      glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains 1 (PAG1) was identified with the most
      phosphorylated tyrosine peptides in Burkitt lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.
      PAG1 knockdown resulted in perturbation of the tyrosine phosphosignature of
      B-cell receptor signaling components. Significantly, PAG1 knockdown increased
      cell proliferation and response to antigen stimulation of these germinal
      center–derived B-NHLs. These data provide a detailed annotation of phosphorylated
      proteins in human lymphoid cancer. Overall, our study revealed the utility of
      unbiased phosphoproteome interrogation in characterizing signaling networks that 
      may provide insights into pathogenesis mechanisms in B-cell lymphomas.

PG  - e1260-
AB  - Lung cancer (LC) is a number one killer of cancer-related death among men and
      women worldwide. Major advances have been made in the diagnosis, staging and use 
      of surgery for LC, but systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy alone or in
      combination with some targeted agents remains the core treatment of advanced LC. 
      Unfortunately, in spite of improved diagnosis, surgical methods and new
      treatments, mortality is still extremely high among LC patients. To understand
      the precise functioning of signaling pathways associated with resistance to
      current treatments in LC, as well as to identify novel treatment regimens, a
      holistic approach to analyze signaling networks should be applied. Here, we
      describe systems biology-based approaches to generate biomarkers and novel
      therapeutic targets in LC, as well as how this may contribute to personalized
      treatment for this malignancy.

TI  - MAS promoter regulation: A role of Sry and tyrosine nitration of the KRAB domain 
      of ZNF274 as a feedback mechanism.
PG  - 727-38
AB  - The ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MAS axis of the renin-angiotensin system has emerged as a
      pathway of interest in treating both cardiovascular disorders and cancer. The MAS
      protein is known to bind to and be activated by Ang-(1-7); however mechanisms of 
      this activation are just starting to be understood. Whereas there are strong
      biochemical data regarding regulation and activation of the AT1 and AT2
      receptors, with models of how Ang II binds each receptor, fewer studies have
      characterized MAS. We characterize the MAS promoter and provide a potential
      feedback mechanism that would compensate for the MAS degradation following
      activation by Ang-(1-7). Analysis of ENCODE data for the MAS promoter revealed
      potential epigenetic control by KRAB/KAP1. A proximal promoter construct for the 
      MAS gene was repressed by the SOX proteins SRY, SOX2, SOX3, and SOX14, of which
      SRY is known to interact with the KRAB domain. The proteins KRAB/KAP1 can both be
      tyrosine nitrated, causing the dissociation of the KAP-1 protein, and thus a
      potential loss of epigenetic control. Activation of MAS can lead to an increase
      in nitric oxide, suggesting feedback mechanisms of MAS on its own promoter. These
      results present a more complete view of MAS regulation and for the first time
      suggest biochemical outcomes for nitration to the KRAB domain.

TI  - DNA-PK: a dynamic enzyme in a versatile DSB repair pathway.
PG  - 21-9
AB  - DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs) are the most cytoxic DNA lesion as the
      inability to properly repair them can lead to genomic instability and
      tumorigenesis. The prominent DSB repair pathway in humans is non-homologous
      end-joining (NHEJ). In the simplest sense, NHEJ mediates the direct re-ligation
      of the broken DNA molecule. However, NHEJ is a complex and versatile process that
      can repair DSBs with a variety of damages and ends via the utilization of a
      significant number of proteins. In this review we will describe the important
      factors and mechanisms modulating NHEJ with emphasis given to the versatility of 
      this repair process and the DNA-PK complex.

TI  - Signal Integration and Gene Induction by a Functionally Distinct STAT3
      Phosphoform.
PG  - 1800-11
AB  - Aberrant activation of the ubiquitous transcription factor STAT3 is a major
      driver of solid tumor progression and pathological angiogenesis. STAT3 activity
      is regulated by numerous posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including Tyr705
      phosphorylation, which is widely used as an indicator of canonical STAT3
      function. Here, we report a noncanonical mechanism of STAT3 activation that
      occurs independently of Tyr705 phosphorylation. Using quantitative liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we have discovered and characterized a
      novel STAT3 phosphoform that is simultaneously phosphorylated at Thr714 and
      Ser727 by glycogen synthase kinase 3α and -β (GSK-3α/β). Both Thr714 and Ser727
      are required for STAT3-dependent gene induction in response to simultaneous
      activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and protease-activated
      receptor 1 (PAR-1) in endothelial cells. In this combinatorial signaling context,
      preventing formation of doubly phosphorylated STAT3 by depleting GSK-3α/β is
      sufficient to disrupt signal integration and inhibit STAT3-dependent gene
      expression. Levels of doubly phosphorylated STAT3 but not of
      Tyr705-phosphorylated STAT3 are remarkably elevated in clear-cell renal-cell
      carcinoma relative to adjacent normal tissue, suggesting that the GSK-3α/β–STAT3 
      pathway is active in the disease. Collectively, our results describe a
      functionally distinct, noncanonical STAT3 phosphoform that positively regulates
      target gene expression in a combinatorial signaling context and identify
      GSK-3α/β–STAT3 signaling as a potential therapeutic target in renal-cell
      carcinoma.

TI  - Identification of 2R-ohnologue gene families displaying the same mutation-load
      skew in multiple cancers.
LID - 140029
AB  - The complexity of signalling pathways was boosted at the origin of the
      vertebrates, when two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R-WGD) occurred. Those
      genes and proteins that have survived from the 2R-WGD—termed 2R-ohnologues—belong
      to families of two to four members, and are enriched in signalling components
      relevant to cancer. Here, we find that while only approximately 30% of human
      transcript-coding genes are 2R-ohnologues, they carry 42–60% of the gene
      mutations in 30 different cancer types. Across a subset of cancer datasets,
      including melanoma, breast, lung adenocarcinoma, liver and medulloblastoma, we
      identified 673 2R-ohnologue families in which one gene carries mutations at
      multiple positions, while sister genes in the same family are relatively mutation
      free. Strikingly, in 315 of the 322 2R-ohnologue families displaying such a skew 
      in multiple cancers, the same gene carries the heaviest mutation load in each
      cancer, and usually the second-ranked gene is also the same in each cancer. Our
      findings inspire the hypothesis that in certain cancers, heterogeneous
      combinations of genetic changes impair parts of the 2R-WGD signalling networks
      and force information flow through a limited set of oncogenic pathways in which
      specific non-mutated 2R-ohnologues serve as effectors. The non-mutated
      2R-ohnologues are therefore potential therapeutic targets. These include proteins
      linked to growth factor signalling, neurotransmission and ion channels.

TI  - Inhibition of KRAS-driven tumorigenicity by interruption of an autocrine cytokine
      circuit.
PG  - 452-65
AB  - Although the roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
      phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling in KRAS-driven tumorigenesis are
      well established, KRAS activates additional pathways required for tumor
      maintenance, inhibition of which are likely to be necessary for effective
      KRAS-directed therapy. Here we show that the IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKKε
      promote KRAS-driven tumorigenesis by regulating autocrine CCL5 and IL-6 and
      identify CYT387 as a potent JAK/TBK1/IKKε inhibitor. CYT387 treatment ablates
      RAS-associated cytokine signaling and impairs Kras-driven murine lung cancer
      growth. Combined CYT387 and MEK inhibitor therapy induces regression of
      aggressive murine lung adenocarcinomas driven by Kras mutation and p53 loss.
      These observations reveal that TBK1/IKKε promote tumor survival by activating
      CCL5 and IL-6 and identify concurrent inhibition of TBK1/IKKε, JAK, and MEK
      signaling as an effective approach to inhibit the actions of oncogenic KRAS.

TI  - Protected Amine Labels: A Versatile Molecular Scaffold for Multiplexed Nominal
      Mass and Sub-Da Isotopologue Quantitative Proteomic Reagents.
PG  - 636-50
AB  - We assemble a versatile molecular scaffold from simple building blocks to create 
      binary and multiplexed stable isotope reagents for quantitative mass
      spectrometry. Termed Protected Amine Labels (PAL), these reagents offer multiple 
      analytical figures of merit including, (i) robust targeting of peptide N-termini 
      and lysyl side chains, (ii) optimal mass spectrometry ionization efficiency
      through regeneration of primary amines on labeled peptides, (iii) an amino
      acid-based mass tag that incorporates heavy isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and
      oxygen to ensure matched physicochemical and MS/MS fragmentation behavior among
      labeled peptides, and (iv) a molecularly efficient architecture, in which the
      majority of hetero-atom centers can be used to synthesize a variety of nominal
      mass and sub-Da isotopologue stable isotope reagents. We demonstrate the
      performance of these reagents in well-established strategies whereby up to four
      channels of peptide isotopomers, each separated by 4 Da are quantified in
      MS-level scans with accuracies comparable to current commercial reagents. In
      addition we utilize the PAL scaffold to create isotopologue reagents in which
      labeled peptide analogs differ in mass based on the binding energy in carbon and 
      nitrogen nuclei, thereby allowing quantification based on MS or MS/MS spectra. We
      demonstrate accurate quantification for reagents that support 6-plex labeling and
      propose extension of this scheme to 9-channels based on a similar PAL scaffold.
      Finally we provide exemplar data that extends the application of
      isotopologe-based quantification reagents to medium resolution, quadrupole
      time-of-flight mass spectrometers.

TI  - Mass Spectrometry-Based Quantitative Proteomics for Dissecting Multiplexed Redox 
      Cysteine Modifications in Nitric Oxide-Protected Cardiomyocyte Under Hypoxia.
PG  - 1365-81
AB  - Aims: Distinctive states of redox-dependent cysteine (Cys) modifications are
      known to regulate signaling homeostasis under various pathophysiological
      conditions, including myocardial injury or protection in response to ischemic
      stress. Recent evidence further implicates a dynamic interplay among these
      modified forms following changes in cellular redox environment. However, a
      precise delineation of multiplexed Cys modifications in a cellular context
      remains technically challenging. To this end, we have now developed a mass
      spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative approach using a set of novel
      iodoacetyl-based Cys-reactive isobaric tags (irreversible isobaric iodoacetyl
      Cys-reactive tandem mass tag [iodoTMT]) endowed with unique irreversible
      Cys-reactivities. Results: We have established a sequential iodoTMT-switch
      procedure coupled with efficient immunoenrichment and advanced shotgun liquid
      chromatography-MS/MS analysis. This workflow allows us to differentially quantify
      the multiple redox-modified forms of a Cys site in the original cellular context.
      In one single analysis, we have identified over 260 Cys sites showing
      quantitative differences in multiplexed redox modifications from the total
      lysates of H9c2 cardiomyocytes experiencing hypoxia in the absence and presence
      of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), indicative of a distinct pattern of individual
      susceptibility to S-nitrosylation or S-glutathionylation. Among those most
      significantly affected are proteins functionally implicated in hypoxic damage
      from which we showed that GSNO would protect. Innovation: We demonstrate for the 
      first time how quantitative analysis of various Cys-redox modifications occurring
      in biological samples can be performed precisely and simultaneously at proteomic 
      levels. Conclusion: We have not only developed a new approach to map global
      Cys-redoxomic regulation in vivo, but also provided new evidences implicating
      Cys-redox modifications of key molecules in NO-mediated ischemic
      cardioprotection. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 20, 1365–1381.

TI  - β-arrestin-1 mediates the TCR-triggered re-routing of distal receptors to the
      immunological synapse by a PKC-mediated mechanism.
PG  - 559-77
AB  - T-cell receptors (TCR) recognize their antigen ligand at the interface between T 
      cells and antigen-presenting cells, known as the immunological synapse (IS). The 
      IS provides a means of sustaining the TCR signal which requires the continual
      supply of new TCRs. These are endocytosed and redirected from distal membrane
      locations to the IS. In our search for novel cytoplasmic effectors, we have
      identified β-arrestin-1 as a ligand of non-phosphorylated resting TCRs. Using
      dominant-negative and knockdown approaches we demonstrate that β-arrestin-1 is
      required for the internalization and downregulation of non-engaged bystander
      TCRs. Furthermore, TCR triggering provokes the β-arrestin-1-mediated
      downregulation of the G-protein coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4, but not of
      other control receptors. We demonstrate that β-arrestin-1 recruitment to the TCR,
      and bystander TCR and CXCR4 downregulation, are mechanistically mediated by the
      TCR-triggered PKC-mediated phosphorylation of β-arrestin-1 at Ser163. This
      mechanism allows the first triggered TCRs to deliver a stop migration signal, and
      to promote the internalization of distal TCRs and CXCR4 and their translocation
      to the IS. This receptor crosstalk mechanism is critical to sustain the TCR
      signal.

TI  - Nutrient sensing and signaling in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 254-99
AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been a favorite organism for pioneering
      studies on nutrient-sensing and signaling mechanisms. Many specific nutrient
      responses have been elucidated in great detail. This has led to important new
      concepts and insight into nutrient-controlled cellular regulation. Major
      highlights include the central role of the Snf1 protein kinase in the glucose
      repression pathway, galactose induction, the discovery of a G-protein-coupled
      receptor system, and role of Ras in glucose-induced cAMP signaling, the role of
      the protein synthesis initiation machinery in general control of nitrogen
      metabolism, the cyclin-controlled protein kinase Pho85 in phosphate regulation,
      nitrogen catabolite repression and the nitrogen-sensing target of rapamycin
      pathway, and the discovery of transporter-like proteins acting as nutrient
      sensors. In addition, a number of cellular targets, like carbohydrate stores,
      stress tolerance, and ribosomal gene expression, are controlled by the presence
      of multiple nutrients. The protein kinase A signaling pathway plays a major role 
      in this general nutrient response. It has led to the discovery of nutrient
      transceptors (transporter receptors) as nutrient sensors. Major shortcomings in
      our knowledge are the relationship between rapid and steady-state nutrient
      signaling, the role of metabolic intermediates in intracellular nutrient sensing,
      and the identity of the nutrient sensors controlling cellular growth.

TI  - Synaptic activity bidirectionally regulates a novel sequence-specific S-Q
      phosphoproteome in neurons.
PG  - 841-51
AB  - Protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in neuronal transcription,
      translation, cell viability, and synaptic plasticity. In neurons, phospho-enzymes
      and specific substrates directly link glutamate release and post-synaptic
      depolarization to these cellular functions; however, many of these enzymes and
      their protein substrates remain uncharacterized or unidentified. In this article,
      we identify a novel, synaptically-driven neuronal phosphoproteome characterized
      by a specific motif of serine/threonine-glutamine ([S/T]-Q, abbreviated as SQ).
      These SQ-containing substrates are predominantly localized to dendrites,
      synapses, the soma; and activation of this SQ phosphoproteome by bicuculline
      application is induced via calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. On the
      other hand, acute application of NMDA can inactivate this SQ phosphoproteome. We 
      demonstrate that the SQ motif kinase Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) can also
      localize to dendrites and dendritic spines, in addition to other subcellular
      compartments, and is activated by bicuculline application. Pharmacology studies
      indicate that ATM and its sister kinase ATR up-regulate these neuronal SQ
      substrates. Phosphoproteomics identified over 150 SQ-containing substrates whose 
      phosphorylation is bidirectionally-regulated by synaptic activity.

TI  - The AMPK inhibitor Compound C is a potent AMPK-independent anti-glioma agent.
PG  - 596-605
AB  - AMPK is an evolutionarily conserved energy sensor important for cell growth,
      proliferation, survival and metabolic regulation. Active AMPK inhibits
      biosynthetic enzymes like mTOR and acetyl CoA carboxylase (required for protein
      and lipid synthesis, respectively) to ensure that cells maintain essential
      nutrients and energy during metabolic crisis. Despite our knowledge about this
      incredibly important kinase, no specific chemical inhibitors are available to
      examine its function. However, one small molecule known as Compound C (also
      called dorsomorphin) has been widely used in cell-based, biochemical and in vivo 
      assays as a selective AMPK inhibitor. In nearly all these reports including a
      recent study in glioma, the biochemical and cellular effects of Compound C has
      been attributed to its inhibitory action towards AMPK. While examining the status
      of AMPK activation in human gliomas, we observed that glioblastomas (GBMs)
      express copious amount of active AMPK. Compound C effectively reduced glioma
      viability in vitro both by inhibiting proliferation and inducing cell death. As
      expected, Compound C inhibited AMPK; however, all the antiproliferative effects
      of this compound were AMPK-independent. Instead, Compound C killed glioma cells
      by multiple mechanisms including activation of the Calpain/Cathepsin pathway,
      inhibition of AKT, mTORC1/C2, cell cycle block at G2M and induction of
      necroptosis and autophagy. Importantly, normal astrocytes were significantly less
      susceptible to Compound C. In summary, Compound C is an extremely potent
      anti-glioma agent but we suggest that caution should be taken in interpreting
      results when this compound is used as an AMPK inhibitor.

TI  - MEK-Dependent Negative Feedback Underlies BCR-ABL-Mediated Oncogene Addiction.
PG  - 200-15
AB  - The clinical experience with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the
      treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) provides compelling evidence for
      oncogene addiction. Yet, the molecular basis of oncogene addiction remains
      elusive. Through unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses of CML cells
      transiently exposed to BCR-ABL TKI, we identified persistent downregulation of
      growth factor receptor (GF-R) signaling pathways. We then established and
      validated a tissue-relevant isogenic model of BCR-ABL-mediated addiction, and
      found evidence for myeloid GF-R signaling pathway rewiring that profoundly and
      persistently dampens physiologic pathway activation. We demonstrate that eventual
      restoration of ligand-mediated GF-R pathway activation is insufficient to fully
      rescue cells from a competing apoptotic fate. In contrast to previous work with
      BRAFV600E in melanoma cells, feedback inhibition following BCR-ABL TKI treatment 
      is markedly prolonged, extending beyond the time required to initiate apoptosis. 
      Mechanistically, BCR-ABL-mediated oncogene addiction is facilitated by persistent
      high levels of MEK-dependent negative feedback.

TI  - Identification of Peroxiredoxin-5 in Bovine Cauda Epididymal Sperm.
PG  - 113-21
AB  - Developing spermatozoa require a series of post-testicular modifications within
      the luminal environment of the epididymis to achieve maturation; this involves
      several surface modifications including changes in plasma membrane lipids,
      proteins, carbohydrates, and alterations in the outer acrosomal membrane.
      Epididymal maturation can therefore allow sperm to gain forward motility and
      fertilization capabilities. The objective of this study was to identify
      maturation dependent protein(s) and to investigate their role with the production
      of functionally competent spermatozoa. Lectin blot analyses of caput and cauda
      sperm plasma membrane fractions identified a 17.5kDa Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) 
      binding polypeptide present in the cauda sperm plasma membrane not in the caput
      sperm plasma membrane. Among the several WGA stained bands, the presence of a
      17.5kDa WGA binding polypeptide band was detected only in cauda epididymal fluid 
      not in caput epididymal fluid suggesting that the 17.5kDa WGA-binding polypeptide
      is secreted from the cauda epididymis and binds to the cauda sperm plasma
      membrane during epididymal transit. Proteomic identification of the 17.5kDa
      polypeptide yielded 13 peptides that matched the sequence of peroxiredoxin-5
      (PRDX5) protein (Bos Taurus). We propose that bovine cauda sperm PRDX5 acts as an
      antioxidant enzyme in the epididymal environment, which is crucial in protecting 
      the viable sperm population against the damage caused by endogeneous or
      exogeneous peroxide.

TI  - Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Protein Phosphorylation Networks in Tetrahymena
      thermophila, a Model Single-celled Organism*.
PG  - 503-19
AB  - Tetrahymena thermophila is a widely used unicellular eukaryotic model organism in
      biological research and contains more than 1000 protein kinases and phosphatases 
      with specificity for Ser/Thr/Tyr residues. However, only a few dozen
      phosphorylation sites in T. thermophila are known, presenting a major obstacle to
      further understanding of the regulatory roles of reversible phosphorylation in
      this organism. In this study, we used high-accuracy mass-spectrometry-based
      proteomics to conduct global and site-specific phosphoproteome profiling of T.
      thermophila. In total, 1384 phosphopeptides and 2238 phosphorylation sites from
      1008 T. thermophila proteins were identified through the combined use of peptide 
      prefractionation, TiO2 enrichment, and two-dimensional LC-MS/MS analysis. The
      identified phosphoproteins are implicated in the regulation of various biological
      processes such as transport, gene expression, and mRNA metabolic process.
      Moreover, integrated analysis of the T. thermophila phosphoproteome and gene
      network revealed the potential biological functions of many previously
      unannotated proteins and predicted some putative kinase–substrate pairs. Our data
      provide the first global survey of phosphorylation in T. thermophila using a
      phosphoproteomic approach and suggest a wide-ranging regulatory scope of this
      modification. The provided dataset is a valuable resource for the future
      understanding of signaling pathways in this important model organism.

AB  - Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism for optimal growth and survival.
      AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key energy sensor that controls many
      metabolic pathways including metabolic reprogramming. However, its role in cancer
      is poorly understood. Some studies claim that it has a tumor suppressor role
      while others show its protumor role. Two AMPK-activating compounds (including
      metformin, now in many clinical trials) are widely used to suppress cancer cell
      proliferation. We found that AMPK is abundantly expressed in high-grade gliomas
      and, in contrast to popular belief, these two AMPK activators suppressed glioma
      cell proliferation through unique AMPK-independent mechanisms.

TI  - In vivo cleaved CDCP1 promotes early tumor dissemination via complexing with
      activated β1 integrin and induction of FAK/PI3K/Akt motility signaling.
PG  - 255-68
AB  - Specific cleavage of the transmembrane molecule, CUB domain-containing protein-1 
      (CDCP1), by plasmin-like serine proteases induces outside–in signal transduction 
      that facilitates early stages of spontaneous metastasis leading to tumor cell
      intravasation, namely cell escape from the primary tumor, stromal invasion and
      transendothelial migration. We identified active β1 integrin as a biochemical and
      functional partner of the membrane-retained 70-kDa CDCP1 fragment, newly
      generated from its full-length 135-kDa precursor though proteolytic cleavage by
      serine proteases. Both in cell cultures and in live animals, active β1 integrin
      complexed preferentially with functionally activated, phosphorylated 70-kDa
      CDCP1. Complexing of β1 integrin the 70-kDa with CDCP1 fragment induced
      intracellular phosphorylation signaling, involving focal adhesion kinase-1 (FAK) 
      and PI3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent Akt activation. Thus, inhibition of FAK/PI3K
      activities by specific inhibitors as well as short-hairpin RNA downregulation of 
      β1 integrin significantly reduced FAK/Akt phosphorylation under conditions where 
      CDCP1 was processed by serine proteases, indicating that FAK/PI3K/Akt pathway
      operates downstream of cleaved CDCP1 complexed with β1 integrin. Furthermore,
      this complex-dependent signaling correlated positively with high levels of tumor 
      cell intravasation and dissemination. Correspondingly, abrogation in vivo of
      CDCP1 cleavage either by unique cleavage-blocking monoclonal antibody 10-D7 or by
      inhibition of proteolytic activity of plasmin-like serine proteases with
      aprotinin prevented β1 integrin/CDCP1 complexing and downstream FAK/Akt signaling
      concomitant with significant reduction of stromal invasion and spontaneous
      metastasis. Therefore, β1 integrin appears to serve as a motility-regulating
      partner mediating cross-talk between proteolytically cleaved, membrane-retained
      CDCP1 and members of FAK/PI3K/Akt pathway. This CDCP1 cleavage-induced signaling 
      cascade constitutes a unique mechanism, independent of extracellular matrix
      remodeling, whereby a proteolytically cleaved CDCP1 regulates in vivo locomotion 
      and metastasis of tumor cells through β1 integrin partnering. Our findings
      indicate that CDCP1 cleavage, occurring at the apex of a β1 integrin/FAK/PI3K/Akt
      signaling cascade, may represent a therapeutic target for CDCP1-positive cancers.

TI  - Parkinson-related LRRK2 mutation R1441C/G/H impairs PKA phosphorylation of LRRK2 
      and disrupts its interaction with 14-3-3.
PG  - E34-43
AB  - Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a multidomain protein implicated in
      Parkinson disease, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) has been suggested to 
      act as an upstream kinase phosphorylating LRRK2. Using a phosphoproteomics
      approach, we identified several novel PKA phosphorylation sites on LRRK2. We
      could demonstrate that one PKA phosphosite comprises the second most common
      mutation in LRRK2 (R1441C/G/H) attributed to Parkinson disease. Our findings
      reveal that this site is mandatory for subsequent 14-3-3 binding and affects
      LRRK2 kinase activity. These data provide a mechanistic insight into the
      regulation of LRRK2 kinase activity and its perturbation by disease-associated
      mutations.

TI  - Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Gossypol-Induced Apoptosis in Ovarian Cancer Cell
      Line, HOC1a.
LID - 123482
AB  - Ovarian cancer is a major cause for death of gynecological cancer patients. The
      efficacy of traditional surgery and chemotherapy is rather compromised and
      platinum-resistant cancer recurs. Finding new therapeutic targets is urgently
      needed to increase the survival rate and to improve life quality of patients with
      ovarian cancer. In the present work, phosphoproteomic analysis was carried out on
      untreated and gossypol-treated ovarian cancer cell line, HOC1a. We identified
      approximately 9750 phosphopeptides from 3030 phosphoproteins, which are involved 
      in diverse cellular processes including cytoskeletal organization, RNA and
      nucleotide binding, and cell cycle regulation. Upon gossypol treatment, changes
      in phosphorylation of twenty-nine proteins including YAP1 and AKAP12 were
      characterized. Western blotting and qPCR analysis were used to determine
      expression levels of proteins in YAP1-related Hippo pathway showing that gossypol
      induced upregulation of LATS1, which phosphorylates YAP1 at Ser 61. Furthermore, 
      our data showed that gossypol targets the actin cytoskeletal organization through
      mediating phosphorylation states of actin-binding proteins. Taken together, our
      data provide valuable information to understand effects of gossypol on protein
      phosphorylation and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells.

TI  - Profiling the tyrosine phosphoproteome of different mouse mammary tumour models
      reveals distinct, model-specific signalling networks and conserved oncogenic
      pathways.
LID - 437
AB  - Introduction: Although aberrant tyrosine kinase signalling characterises
      particular breast cancer subtypes, a global analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation 
      in mouse models of breast cancer has not been undertaken to date. This may
      identify conserved oncogenic pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Methods:
      We applied an immunoaffinity/mass spectrometry workflow to three mouse models:
      murine stem cell virus-Neu, expressing truncated Neu, the rat orthologue of human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2, Her2 (HER2); mouse mammary tumour
      virus-polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyMT); and the p53−/− transplant model
      (p53). Pathways and protein–protein interaction networks were identified by
      bioinformatics analysis. Molecular mechanisms underpinning differences in
      tyrosine phosphorylation were characterised by Western blot analysis and array
      comparative genomic hybridisation. The functional role of mesenchymal–epithelial 
      transition factor (Met) in a subset of p53-null tumours was interrogated using a 
      selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), small interfering RNA (siRNA)–mediated
      knockdown and cell proliferation assays. Results: The three models could be
      distinguished on the basis of tyrosine phosphorylation signatures and signalling 
      networks. HER2 tumours exhibited a protein–protein interaction network centred on
      avian erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 2 (Erbb2), epidermal
      growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, and they
      displayed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor
      1. In contrast, the PyMT network displayed significant enrichment for components 
      of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling pathway, whereas p53 tumours
      exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Met and components or regulators 
      of the cytoskeleton and shared signalling network characteristics with basal and 
      claudin-low breast cancer cells. A subset of p53 tumours displayed markedly
      elevated cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and Met expression, as well as Met
      gene amplification. Treatment of cultured p53-null cells exhibiting Met
      amplification with a selective Met TKI abrogated aberrant tyrosine
      phosphorylation and blocked cell proliferation. The effects on proliferation were
      recapitulated when Met was knocked down using siRNA. Additional subtypes of p53
      tumours exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation of other oncogenes,
      including Peak1/SgK269 and Prex2. Conclusion: This study provides network-level
      insights into signalling in the breast cancer models utilised and demonstrates
      that comparative phosphoproteomics can identify conserved oncogenic signalling
      pathways. The Met-amplified, p53-null tumours provide a new preclinical model for
      a subset of triple-negative breast cancers. Electronic supplementary material:

TI  - Integrating Omics Technologies to Study Pulmonary Physiology and Pathology at the
      Systems Level.
PG  - 1239-60
AB  - Assimilation and integration of “omics” technologies, including genomics,
      epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has readily altered the landscape of
      medical research in the last decade. The vast and complex nature of omics data
      can only be interpreted by linking molecular information at the organismic level,
      forming the foundation of systems biology. Research in pulmonary biology/medicine
      has necessitated integration of omics, network, systems and computational biology
      data to differentially diagnose, interpret, and prognosticate pulmonary diseases,
      facilitating improvement in therapy and treatment modalities. This review
      describes how to leverage this emerging technology in understanding pulmonary
      diseases at the systems level –called a “systomic” approach. Considering the
      operational wholeness of cellular and organ systems, diseased genome, proteome,
      and the metabolome needs to be conceptualized at the systems level to understand 
      disease pathogenesis and progression. Currently available omics technology and
      resources require a certain degree of training and proficiency in addition to
      dedicated hardware and applications, making them relatively less user friendly
      for the pulmonary biologist and clinicians. Herein, we discuss the various
      strategies, computational tools and approaches required to study pulmonary
      diseases at the systems level for biomedical scientists and clinical researchers.

TI  - Inflammatory stress and sarcomagenesis: a vicious interplay.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - Chronic inflammation represents one of the hallmarks of cancer, but its role in
      sarcomagenesis has long been overlooked. Sarcomas are a rare and heterogeneous
      group of tumors of mesenchymal origin accounting for less than 1 % of cancers in 
      adults but 21 % of cancers in the pediatric population. Sarcomas are associated
      with bad prognosis, and their management requires a multidisciplinary team
      approach. Several lines of evidence indicate that inflammation has been
      implicated in sarcomagenesis leading to the activation of the key transcription
      factors HIF-1, NF- κB, and STAT-3 involved in a complex inflammatory network. In 
      the past years, an increasing number of new targets have been identified in the
      treatment of sarcomas leading to the development of new drugs that aim to
      interrupt the vicious connection between inflammation and sarcomagenesis. This
      article makes a brief overview of preclinical and clinical evidence of the
      molecular pathways involved in the inflammatory stress response in sarcomagenesis
      and the most targeted therapies.

TI  - Green fluorescent protein expression triggers proteome changes in breast cancer
      cells.
LID - 10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.07.019
AB  - Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is the most commonly used reporter of expression 
      in cell biology despite evidence that it affects the cell physiology. The
      molecular mechanism of GFP-associated modifications has been largely unexplored. 
      In this paper we investigated the proteome modifications following stable
      expression of GFP in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). A combination of three
      different proteome analysis methods (2-DE, iTRAQ, label-free) was used to
      maximise proteome coverage. We found that GFP expression induces changes in
      expression of proteins that are associated with protein folding, cytoskeletal
      organisation and cellular immune response. In view of these findings, the use of 
      GFP as a cell reporter should be carefully monitored.

TI  - Discoidin domain receptor functions in physiological and pathological conditions.
PG  - 39-87
AB  - The discoidin domain receptors, DDR1 and DDR2, are non-integrin collagen
      receptors that are members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. Both DDRs bind
      a number of different collagen types and play important roles in embryo
      development. Dysregulated DDR function is associated with progression of various 
      human diseases, including fibrosis, arthritis and cancer. By interacting with key
      components of the extracellular matrix and displaying distinct activation
      kinetics, the DDRs form a unique subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases.
      DDR-facilitated cellular functions include cell migration, cell survival,
      proliferation and differentiation, as well as remodelling of extracellular
      matrices. This review summarises the current knowledge of DDR-ligand
      interactions, DDR-initiated signal pathways and the molecular mechanisms that
      regulate receptor function. Also discussed are the roles of DDRs in development
      and disease progression.

LID - 962962
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) is a well characterized growth factor among
      the 22 members of the FGF superfamily in humans. It binds to all the four known
      FGF receptors and regulates a plethora of functions including cell growth,
      proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival in different cell types. 
      FGF-1 is involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes such as
      development, angiogenesis, wound healing, adipogenesis, and neurogenesis.
      Deregulation of FGF-1 signaling is not only implicated in tumorigenesis but also 
      is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Given the biomedical
      significance of FGFs and the fact that individual FGFs have different roles in
      diverse physiological processes, the analysis of signaling pathways induced by
      the binding of specific FGFs to their cognate receptors demands more focused
      efforts. Currently, there are no resources in the public domain that facilitate
      the analysis of signaling pathways induced by individual FGFs in the FGF/FGFR
      signaling system. Towards this, we have developed a resource of signaling
      reactions triggered by FGF-1/FGFR system in various cell types/tissues. The
      pathway data and the reaction map are made available for download in different
      community standard data exchange formats through NetPath and NetSlim signaling
      pathway resources.

TI  - Transforming Growth Factor β Regulates P-Body Formation through Induction of the 
      mRNA Decay Factor Tristetraprolin.
PG  - 180-95
AB  - Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a potent growth regulator and tumor
      suppressor in normal intestinal epithelium. Likewise, epithelial cell growth is
      controlled by rapid decay of growth-related mRNAs mediated through 3′
      untranslated region (UTR) AU-rich element (ARE) motifs. We demonstrate that
      treatment of nontransformed intestinal epithelial cells with TGF-β inhibited
      ARE-mRNA expression. This effect of TGF-β was promoted through increased assembly
      of cytoplasmic RNA processing (P) bodies where ARE-mRNA localization was
      observed. P-body formation was dependent on TGF-β/Smad signaling, as Smad3
      deletion abrogated P-body formation. In concert with increased P-body formation, 
      TGF-β induced expression of the ARE-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP), which 
      colocalized to P bodies. TTP expression was necessary for TGF-β-dependent P-body 
      formation and promoted growth inhibition by TGF-β. The significance of this was
      observed in vivo, where colonic epithelium deficient in TGF-β/Smad signaling or
      TTP expression showed attenuated P-body levels. These results provide new insight
      into TGF-β's antiproliferative properties and identify TGF-β as a novel mRNA
      stability regulator in intestinal epithelium through its ability to promote TTP
      expression and subsequent P-body formation.

TI  - Comprehensive Quantitative Comparison of the Membrane Proteome, Phosphoproteome, 
      and Sialiome of Human Embryonic and Neural Stem Cells*.
PG  - 311-28
AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can differentiate into neural stem cells
      (NSCs), which can further be differentiated into neurons and glia cells.
      Therefore, these cells have huge potential as source for treatment of
      neurological diseases. Membrane-associated proteins are very important in
      cellular signaling and recognition, and their function and activity are
      frequently regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation 
      and glycosylation. To obtain information about membrane-associated proteins and
      their modified amino acids potentially involved in changes of hESCs and NSCs as
      well as to investigate potential new markers for these two cell stages, we
      performed large-scale quantitative membrane-proteomic of hESCs and NSCs. This
      approach employed membrane purification followed by peptide dimethyl labeling and
      peptide enrichment to study the membrane subproteome as well as changes in
      phosphorylation and sialylation between hESCs and NSCs. Combining proteomics and 
      modification specific proteomics we identified a total of 5105 proteins whereof
      57% contained transmembrane domains or signal peptides. The enrichment strategy
      yielded a total of 10,087 phosphorylated peptides in which 78% of phosphopeptides
      were identified with ≥99% confidence in site assignment and 1810 unique formerly 
      sialylated N-linked glycopeptides. Several proteins were identified as
      significantly regulated in hESCs and NSC, including proteins involved in the
      early embryonic and neural development. In the latter group of proteins, we could
      identify potential NSC markers as Crumbs 2 and several novel proteins. A motif
      analysis of the altered phosphosites showed a sequence consensus motif
      (R-X-XpS/T) significantly up-regulated in NSC. This motif is among other kinases 
      recognized by the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-2, emphasizing a possible
      importance of this kinase for this cell stage. Collectively, this data represent 
      the most diverse set of post-translational modifications reported for hESCs and
      NSCs. This study revealed potential markers to distinguish NSCs from hESCs and
      will contribute to improve our understanding on the differentiation process.

TI  - Rule-based modeling: a computational approach for studying biomolecular site
      dynamics in cell signaling systems.
PG  - 13-36
AB  - Rule-based modeling was developed to address the limitations of traditional
      approaches for modeling chemical kinetics in cell signaling systems. These
      systems consist of multiple interacting biomolecules (e.g., proteins), which
      themselves consist of multiple parts (e.g., domains, linear motifs, and sites of 
      phosphorylation). Consequently, biomolecules that mediate information processing 
      generally have the potential to interact in multiple ways, with the number of
      possible complexes and post-translational modification states tending to grow
      exponentially with the number of binary interactions considered. As a result,
      only large reaction networks capture all possible consequences of the molecular
      interactions that occur in a cell signaling system, which is problematic because 
      traditional modeling approaches for chemical kinetics (e.g., ordinary
      differential equations) require explicit network specification. This problem is
      circumvented through representation of interactions in terms of local rules. With
      this approach, network specification is implicit and model specification is
      concise. Concise representation results in a coarse graining of chemical
      kinetics, which is introduced because all reactions implied by a rule inherit the
      rate law associated with that rule. Coarse graining can be appropriate if
      interactions are modular, and the coarseness of a model can be adjusted as
      needed. Rules can be specified using specialized model-specification languages,
      and recently developed tools designed for specification of rule-based models
      allow one to leverage powerful software engineering capabilities. A rule-based
      model comprises a set of rules, which can be processed by general-purpose
      simulation and analysis tools to achieve different objectives (e.g., to perform
      either a deterministic or stochastic simulation).

TI  - Sestrins orchestrate cellular metabolism to attenuate aging.
LID - 10.1016/j.cmet.2013.08.018
AB  - The Sestrins constitute a family of evolutionarily-conserved stress-inducible
      proteins that suppress oxidative stress and regulate adenosine
      monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (AMPK)-mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) signaling. By virtue of these activities, the Sestrins serve as important 
      regulators of metabolic homeostasis. Accordingly, inactivation of Sestrin genes
      in invertebrates resulted in diverse metabolic pathologies, including oxidative
      damage, fat accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and muscle degeneration that 
      resemble accelerated tissue aging. Likewise, Sestrin deficiencies in mice led to 
      accelerated diabetic progression upon obesity. Further investigation of Sestrin
      function and regulation should provide new insights into age-associated metabolic
      diseases, such as diabetes, myopathies and cancer.

AB  - The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is one of the most frequently
      mutated pathways in cancer, and is actively being pursued as a therapeutic
      target. Despite the importance of the PI3K pathway in cancer, durable responses
      to PI3K-pathway targeted therapies are uncommon with monotherapy. Several in
      vitro and xenograft models have elucidated compensatory signaling and genomic
      changes which may limit the therapeutic effectiveness of PI3K inhibitors in the
      clinic. Future clinical trials with prospective evaluation of tumor signaling and
      genomic changes are likely to identify novel resistance mechanisms as well as
      subsets of patients who may derive maximal benefit from PI3K pathway inhibitors.

TI  - Combining docking site and phosphosite predictions to find new substrates:
      Identification of Smoothelin-like-2 (SMTNL2) as a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
      substrate.
PG  - 2518-29
AB  - Specific docking interactions between mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), 
      their regulators, and their downstream substrates, are crucial for efficient and 
      accurate signal transmission. To identify novel substrates of the c-Jun
      N-terminal kinase (JNK) family of MAPKs, we searched the human genome for
      proteins that contained (1), a predicted JNK-docking site (D-site); and (2), a
      cluster of putative JNK target phosphosites located close to the D-site. Here we 
      describe a novel JNK substrate that emerged from this analysis, the functionally 
      uncharacterized protein Smoothelin-like 2 (SMTNL2). SMTNL2 protein bound with
      high-affinity to multiple MAPKs including JNK1-3 and ERK2; furthermore, the
      identity of conserved amino acids in the predicted docking site (residues
      180-193) was necessary for this high-affinity binding. In addition, purified
      full-length SMTNL2 protein was phosphorylated by JNK1-3 in vitro, and this
      required the integrity of the D-site. Using mass spectrometry and mutagenesis, we
      identified four D-site-dependent phosphoacceptor sites in close proximity to the 
      docking site, at S217, S241, T236 and T239. A short peptide comprised of the
      SMTNL2 D-site inhibited JNK-mediated phosphorylation of the ATF2 transcription
      factor, showing that SMTNL2 can compete with other substrates for JNK binding.
      Moreover, when transfected into HEK293 cells, SMTNL2 was phosphorylated by
      endogenous JNK in a D-site dependent manner, on the same residues identified in
      vitro. SMTNL2 protein was expressed in many mammalian tissues, with notably high 
      expression in skeletal muscle. Consistent with the hypothesis that SMTNL2 has a
      function in skeletal muscle, SMTNL2 protein expression was strongly induced
      during the transition from myoblasts to myotubes in differentiating C2C12 cells.

LID - 10.1007/s10157-013-0789-5
AB  - Water excretion is regulated in large part through the regulation of the osmotic 
      water permeability of the renal collecting duct epithelium. The water
      permeability is controlled by vasopressin through regulation of the water
      channel, aquaporin-2 (AQP2). Two processes contribute: 1) regulation of AQP2
      trafficking to the apical plasma membrane; and 2) regulation of the total amount 
      of the AQP2 protein in the cells. Regulation of AQP2 abundance is defective in
      several water balance disorders including many polyuric disorders and the
      syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIADH). Here we review vasopressin
      signaling in the renal collecting duct that is relevant to the two modes of water
      permeability regulation.

TI  - Dynamic feedback circuits function as a switch for shaping a maturation-inducing 
      steroid pulse in Drosophila.
PG  - 4730-9
AB  - Steroid hormones trigger the onset of sexual maturation in animals by initiating 
      genetic response programs that are determined by steroid pulse frequency,
      amplitude and duration. Although steroid pulses coordinate growth and timing of
      maturation during development, the mechanisms generating these pulses are not
      known. Here we show that the ecdysone steroid pulse that drives the
      juvenile-adult transition in Drosophila is determined by feedback circuits in the
      prothoracic gland (PG), the major steroid-producing tissue of insect larvae.
      These circuits coordinate the activation and repression of hormone synthesis, the
      two key parameters determining pulse shape (amplitude and duration). We show that
      ecdysone has a positive-feedback effect on the PG, rapidly amplifying its own
      synthesis to trigger pupariation as the onset of maturation. During the prepupal 
      stage, a negative-feedback signal ensures the decline in ecdysone levels required
      to produce a temporal steroid pulse that drives developmental progression to
      adulthood. The feedback circuits rely on a developmental switch in the expression
      of Broad isoforms that transcriptionally activate or silence components in the
      ecdysone biosynthetic pathway. Remarkably, our study shows that the same
      well-defined genetic program that stimulates a systemic downstream response to
      ecdysone is also utilized upstream to set the duration and amplitude of the
      ecdysone pulse. Activation of this switch-like mechanism ensures a rapid,
      self-limiting PG response that functions in producing steroid oscillations that
      can guide the decision to terminate growth and promote maturation.

AB  - Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common post-translational
      modifications used in signal transduction to control cell growth, proliferation, 
      and survival in response to both intracellular and extracellular stimuli. This
      modification is finely coordinated by a network of kinases and phosphatases that 
      recognize unique sequence motifs and/or mediate their functions through scaffold 
      and adaptor proteins. Detailed information on the nature of kinase substrates and
      site-specific phosphoregulation is required in order for one to better understand
      their pathophysiological roles. Recent advances in affinity chromatography and
      mass spectrometry (MS) sensitivity have enabled the large-scale identification
      and profiling of protein phosphorylation, but appropriate follow-up experiments
      are required in order to ascertain the functional significance of identified
      phosphorylation sites. In this review, we present meaningful technical details
      for MS-based phosphoproteomic analyses and describe important considerations for 
      the selection of model systems and the functional characterization of identified 
      phosphorylation sites.

      Modulate Human Microvascular Endothelial Signaling in a Three-Dimensional Matrix 
      Migration Context*.
PG  - 3704-18
AB  - The process of angiogenesis is under complex regulation in adult organisms,
      particularly as it often occurs in an inflammatory post-wound environment. As
      such, there are many impacting factors that will regulate the generation of new
      blood vessels which include not only pro-angiogenic growth factors such as
      vascular endothelial growth factor, but also angiostatic factors. During initial 
      postwound hemostasis, a large initial bolus of platelet factor 4 is released into
      localized areas of damage before progression of wound healing toward tissue
      homeostasis. Because of its early presence and high concentration, the
      angiostatic chemokine platelet factor 4, which can induce endothelial anoikis,
      can strongly affect angiogenesis. In our work, we explored signaling crosstalk
      interactions between vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet factor 4
      using phosphotyrosine-enriched mass spectrometry methods on human dermal
      microvascular endothelial cells cultured under conditions facilitating migratory 
      sprouting into collagen gel matrices. We developed new methods to enable mass
      spectrometry-based phosphorylation analysis of primary cells cultured on collagen
      gels, and quantified signaling pathways over the first 48 h of treatment with
      vascular endothelial growth factor in the presence or absence of platelet factor 
      4. By observing early and late signaling dynamics in tandem with correlation
      network modeling, we found that platelet factor 4 has significant crosstalk with 
      vascular endothelial growth factor by modulating cell migration and polarization 
      pathways, centered around P38α MAPK, Src family kinases Fyn and Lyn, along with
      FAK. Interestingly, we found EphA2 correlational topology to strongly involve key
      migration-related signaling nodes after introduction of platelet factor 4,
      indicating an influence of the angiostatic factor on this ambiguous but generally
      angiogenic signal in this complex environment.

TI  - ERK phosphorylation of MED14 in promoter complexes during mitogen-induced gene
      activation by Elk-1.
PG  - 10241-53
AB  - The ETS domain transcription factor Elk-1 stimulates expression of immediate
      early genes (IEGs) in response to mitogens. These events require phosphorylation 
      of Elk-1 by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and
      phosphorylation-dependent interaction of Elk-1 with co-activators, including
      histone acetyltransferases and the Mediator complex. Elk-1 also recruits ERK to
      the promoters of its target genes, suggesting that ERK phosphorylates additional 
      substrates in transcription complexes at mitogen-responsive promoters. Here we
      report that MED14, a core subunit of the Mediator, is a bona fide ERK substrate
      and identify serine 986 (S986) within a serine-proline rich region of MED14 as
      the major ERK phosphorylation site. Mitogens induced phosphorylation of MED14 on 
      S986 at IEG promoters; RNAi knockdown of MED14 reduced CDK8 and RNA polymerase II
      (RNAPII) recruitment, RNAPII C-terminal domain phosphorylation and impaired
      activation of IEG transcription. A single alanine substitution at S986 reduced
      activation of an E26 (ETS)-responsive reporter by oncogenic Ras and
      mitogen-induced, Elk-1-dependent transcription, whereas activities of other
      transcriptional activators were unaffected. We also demonstrate that Elk-1 can
      associate with MED14 independently of MED23, which may facilitate phosphorylation
      of MED14 by ERK to impart a positive and selective impact on mitogen-responsive
      gene expression.

PG  - 19426-31
AB  - Growing evidence suggests that successful intervention in many human cancers will
      require combinations of therapeutic agents. Critical to this effort will be a
      detailed understanding of the crosstalk between signaling networks that modulate 
      proliferation, cell death, drug sensitivity, and acquired resistance. Here we
      investigated DNA-damage signaling elicited by small-molecule inhibitors against
      MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) and PI3K in melanoma cells. This work, performed using
      cutting-edge mass spectrometry proteomics, uncovered a burst of signaling among
      proteins in the DNA-damage pathway upon initiation of the cell-death program by
      agents targeting the RAS–RAF–MEK and PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathways. These signals may
      prove important to the short- and long-term sensitivity of tumor cells to MEK-
      and PI3K-targeted therapies.

TI  - Where is mTOR and what is it doing there?
PG  - 563-74
AB  - Target of rapamycin (TOR) forms two conserved, structurally distinct kinase
      complexes termed TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2. Each complex phosphorylates a
      different set of substrates to regulate cell growth. In mammals, mTOR is
      stimulated by nutrients and growth factors and inhibited by stress to ensure that
      cells grow only during favorable conditions. Studies in different organisms have 
      reported localization of TOR to several distinct subcellular compartments.
      Notably, the finding that mTORC1 is localized to the lysosome has significantly
      enhanced our understanding of mTORC1 regulation. Subcellular localization may be 
      a general principle used by TOR to enact precise spatial and temporal control of 
      cell growth.

      regulating transcription and β-catenin occupancy at Wnt targets. This study thus 
      significantly elaborates on the role of α-catenin in the APC complex and at Wnt
      target genes.

TI  - SILAC-based phosphoproteomics reveals an inhibitory role of KSR1 in p53
      transcriptional activity via modulation of DBC1.
PG  - 2675-84
AB  - Background:: We have previously identified kinase suppressor of ras-1 (KSR1) as a
      potential regulatory gene in breast cancer. KSR1, originally described as a novel
      protein kinase, has a role in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases.
      Emerging evidence has shown that KSR1 may have dual functions as an active kinase
      as well as a scaffold facilitating multiprotein complex assembly. Although
      efforts have been made to study the role of KSR1 in certain tumour types, its
      involvement in breast cancer remains unknown. Methods:: A quantitative mass
      spectrometry analysis using stable isotope labelling of amino acids in cell
      culture (SILAC) was implemented to identify KSR1-regulated phosphoproteins in
      breast cancer. In vitro luciferase assays, co-immunoprecipitation as well as
      western blotting experiments were performed to further study the function of KSR1
      in breast cancer. Results:: Of significance, proteomic analysis reveals that KSR1
      overexpression decreases deleted in breast cancer-1 (DBC1) phosphorylation.
      Furthermore, we show that KSR1 decreases the transcriptional activity of p53 by
      reducing the phosphorylation of DBC1, which leads to a reduced interaction of
      DBC1 with sirtuin-1 (SIRT1); this in turn enables SIRT1 to deacetylate p53.
      Conclusion:: Our findings integrate KSR1 into a network involving DBC1 and SIRT1,
      which results in the regulation of p53 acetylation and its transcriptional
      activity.

TI  - Functional genomics in the study of yeast cell polarity: moving in the right
      direction.
LID - 20130118
AB  - The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used extensively for the
      study of cell polarity, owing to both its experimental tractability and the high 
      conservation of cell polarity and other basic biological processes among
      eukaryotes. The budding yeast has also served as a pioneer model organism for
      virtually all genome-scale approaches, including functional genomics, which aims 
      to define gene function and biological pathways systematically through the
      analysis of high-throughput experimental data. Here, we outline the contributions
      of functional genomics and high-throughput methodologies to the study of cell
      polarity in the budding yeast. We integrate data from published genetic screens
      that use a variety of functional genomics approaches to query different aspects
      of polarity. Our integrated dataset is enriched for polarity processes, as well
      as some processes that are not intrinsically linked to cell polarity, and may
      provide new areas for future study.

TI  - ERK as a model for systems biology of enzyme kinetics in cells.
PG  - R972-9
AB  - A key step towards a chemical picture of enzyme catalysis was taken in 1913, when
      Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten published their studies of sucrose hydrolysis by
      invertase. Based on a novel experimental design and a mathematical model, their
      work offered a quantitative view of biochemical kinetics well before the protein 
      nature of enzymes was established and complexes with substrates could be
      detected. Michaelis-Menten kinetics provides a solid framework for enzyme
      kinetics in vitro, but what about kinetics in cells, where enzymes can be highly 
      regulated and participate in a multitude of interactions? We discuss this
      question using the Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) as a model of an
      important enzyme for which we have crystal structures, quantitative in vitro
      assays, and a vast list of binding partners. Despite great progress, we still
      cannot quantitatively predict how the rates of ERK-dependent reactions respond to
      genetic and pharmacological perturbations. Achieving this goal, which is
      important from both fundamental and practical standpoints, requires measuring the

TI  - A Specific PTPRC/CD45 Phosphorylation Event Governed by Stem Cell Chemokine
      CXCL12 Regulates Primitive Hematopoietic Cell Motility*.
PG  - 3319-29
AB  - CXCL12 governs cellular motility, a process deregulated by hematopoietic stem
      cell oncogenes such as p210-BCR-ABL. A phosphoproteomics approach to the analysis
      of a hematopoietic progenitor cell line treated with CXCL12 and the Rac 1 and 2
      inhibitor NSC23766 has been employed to objectively discover novel mechanisms for
      regulation of stem cells in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. The proteomic
      data sets identified new aspects of CXCL12-mediated signaling and novel features 
      of stem cell regulation. We also identified a novel phosphorylation event in
      hematopoietic progenitor cells that correlated with motile response and governed 
      by the chemotactic factor CXCL12. The novel phosphorylation site on PTPRC/CD45; a
      protein tyrosine phosphatase, was validated by raising an antibody to the site
      and also using a mass spectrometry absolute quantification strategy. Site
      directed mutagenesis and inhibitor studies demonstrated that this single
      phosphorylation site governs hematopoietic progenitor cell and lymphoid cell
      motility, lies downstream from Rac proteins and potentiates Src signaling. We
      have also demonstrated that PTPRC/CD45 is down-regulated in leukemogenic tyrosine
      kinase expressing cells. The use of discovery proteomics has enabled further
      understanding of the regulation of PTPRC/CD45 and its important role in cellular 
      motility in progenitor cells.

TI  - Development of a 5-plex SILAC Method Tuned for the Quantitation of Tyrosine
      Phosphorylation Dynamics.
PG  - 3339-49
AB  - The propagation of phosphorylation downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases is a
      key dynamic cellular event involved in signal transduction, which is often
      deregulated in disease states such as cancer. Probing phosphorylation dynamics is
      therefore crucial for understanding receptor tyrosine kinases' function and
      finding ways to inhibit their effects. MS methods combined with metabolic
      labeling such as stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)
      have already proven successful in deciphering temporal phosphotyrosine
      perturbations. However, they are limited in terms of multiplexing, and they also 
      are time consuming, because several experiments need to be performed separately. 
      Here, we introduce an innovative approach based on 5-plex SILAC that allows
      monitoring of phosphotyrosine signaling perturbations induced by a drug treatment
      in one single experiment. Using this new labeling strategy specifically tailored 
      for phosphotyrosines, it was possible to generate the time profiles for 318
      unique phosphopeptides belonging to 215 proteins from an erlotinib-treated breast
      cancer cell line model. Hierarchical clustering of the time profiles followed by 
      pathway enrichment analysis highlighted epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or
      ErbB1) and ErbB2 signaling as the major pathways affected by erlotinib, thereby
      validating the method. Moreover, based on the similarity of its time profile to
      those of other proteins in the ErbB pathways, the phosphorylation at Tyr453 of
      protein FAM59A, a recently described adaptor of EGFR, was confirmed as tightly
      involved in the signaling cascade. The present investigation also demonstrates
      the remote effect of EGFR inhibition on ErbB3 phosphorylation sites such as
      Tyr1289 and Tyr1328, as well as a potential feedback effect on Tyr877 of ErbB2.
      Overall, the 5-plex SILAC is a straightforward approach that extends sample
      multiplexing and builds up the arsenal of methods for tyrosine phosphorylation
      dynamics.

TI  - H1 histones: current perspectives and challenges.
PG  - 9593-609
AB  - H1 and related linker histones are important both for maintenance of higher-order
      chromatin structure and for the regulation of gene expression. The biology of the
      linker histones is complex, as they are evolutionarily variable, exist in
      multiple isoforms and undergo a large variety of posttranslational modifications 
      in their long, unstructured, NH2- and COOH-terminal tails. We review recent
      progress in understanding the structure, genetics and posttranslational
      modifications of linker histones, with an emphasis on the dynamic interactions of
      these proteins with DNA and transcriptional regulators. We also discuss various
      experimental challenges to the study of H1 and related proteins, including
      limitations of immunological reagents and practical difficulties in the analysis 
      of posttranslational modifications by mass spectrometry.

      Tumors.
LID - 10.1016/j.jprot.2013.07.023
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
      worldwide. Within the molecular scope of NCSLC, a complex landscape of
      dysregulated cellular signaling has emerged, defined largely by mutations in
      select mediators of signal transduction, including the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma (ALK) kinases. Consequently, these mutant
      kinases become constitutively activated and targets for chemotherapeutic
      intervention. Encouragingly, small molecule inhibitors of these pathways have
      shown promise in clinical trials or are approved for clinical use. However, many 
      protein kinases are dysregulated in NSCLC without genetic mutations. To quantify 
      differences in tumor cell signaling that are transparent to genomic methods, we
      established a super-SILAC internal standard derived from NSCLC cell lines grown
      in vitro and labeled with heavy lysine and arginine, and deployed them in a
      phosphoproteomics workflow. We identified 9019 and 8753 phosphorylation sites in 
      two separate tumors. Relative quantification of phosphopeptide abundance between 
      tumor samples allowed for the determination of specific hubs and pathways
      differing between each tumor. Sites downstream of Ras showed decreased inhibitory
      phosphorylation (Raf/Mek) and increased activating phosphorylation (Erk1/2) in
      one tumor versus another. In this way, we were able to quantitatively access
      oncogenic kinase signaling in primary human tumors.

LID - 10.1021/pr4005103
AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative process that involves
      altered brain immune, neuronal and metabolic functions. Understanding the
      underlying mechanisms has relied on mouse models that mimic components of AD
      pathology. We used gel-free, label-free LC/MS/MS to quantify protein and
      phosphopeptide levels in brains of APPSwDI/NOS2−/− (CVN-AD) mice. CVN-AD mice
      show a full spectrum of AD-like pathology, including amyloid deposition,
      hyperphosphorylated and aggregated tau and neuronal loss that worsens with age.
      Tryptic digests, with or without phosphopeptide enrichment on an automated
      titanium dioxide LC system, were separated by on-line two-dimensional LC and
      analyzed on a Waters Synapt G2 HDMS, yielding relative expression for >950
      proteins and >1100 phosphopeptides. Among differentially expressed proteins were 
      known markers found in humans with AD, including GFAP and C1Q. Phosphorylation of
      connexin 43, not previously described in AD, was increased at 42 weeks,
      consistent with dysregulation of gap junctions and activation of astrocytes.
      Additional alterations in phosphoproteins suggests dysregulation of mitochondria,
      synaptic transmission, vesicle trafficking and innate immune pathways. These data
      validate the CVN-AD mouse model of AD, identify novel disease and age-related
      changes in the brain during disease progression and demonstrate the utility of
      integrating unbiased and phosphoproteomics for understanding disease processes in
      AD.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy caused by a
      microenviromentally aided persistence of plasma cells in the bone marrow. The
      role that extracellular vesicles, microvesicles and exosomes, released by MM
      cells have in cell-to-cell communication and signaling in the bone marrow is
      currently unknown. This paper describes the proteomic content of extracellular
      vesicles derived from MM.1S and U266 MM cell lines. First, we compared the
      protein identifications between the vesicles and cellular lysates of each cell
      line finding a large overlap in protein identifications. Next, we applied
      label-free spectral count quantitation to determine proteins with differential
      abundance between the groups. Finally, we used bioinformatics to categorize
      proteins with significantly different abundances into functional groups. The
      results illustrate the first use of label-free spectral counting applied to
      determine relative protein abundances in extracellular vesicles.

PG  - 2497-508
AB  - The fungus Septoria tritici causes the disease septoria tritici blotch in wheat, 
      one of the most economically devastating foliar diseases in this crop. To
      investigate signaling events and defense responses in the wheat–S. tritici
      interaction, we performed a time-course study of S. tritici infection in
      resistant and susceptible wheat using quantitative proteomics and
      phosphoproteomics, with special emphasis on the initial biotrophic phase of
      interactions. Our study revealed an accumulation of defense and stress-related
      proteins, suppression of photosynthesis, and changes in sugar metabolism during
      compatible and incompatible interactions. However, differential regulation of the
      phosphorylation status of signaling proteins, transcription and translation
      regulators, and membrane-associated proteins was observed between two
      interactions. The proteomic data were correlated with a more rapid or stronger
      accumulation of signal molecules, including calcium, H2O2, NO, and sugars, in the
      resistant than in the susceptible cultivar in response to the infection.
      Additionally, 31 proteins and 5 phosphoproteins from the pathogen were
      identified, including metabolic proteins and signaling proteins such as
      GTP-binding proteins, 14–3-3 proteins, and calcium-binding proteins. Quantitative
      PCR analysis showed the expression of fungal signaling genes and genes encoding a
      superoxide dismutase and cell-wall degrading enzymes. These results indicate
      roles of signaling, antioxidative stress mechanisms, and nutrient acquisition in 
      facilitating the initial symptomless growth. Taken in its entirety, our dataset
      suggests interplay between the plant and S. tritici through complex signaling
      networks and downstream molecular events. Resistance is likely related to several
      rapidly and intensively triggered signal transduction cascades resulting in a
      multiple-level activation of transcription and translation processes of defense
      responses. Our sensitive approaches and model provide a comprehensive
      (phospho)proteomics resource for studying signaling from the point of view of
      both host and pathogen during a plant–pathogen interaction.

TI  - Target Inhibition Networks: Predicting Selective Combinations of Druggable
      Targets to Block Cancer Survival Pathways.
LID - e1003226
AB  - A recent trend in drug development is to identify drug combinations or
      multi-target agents that effectively modify multiple nodes of disease-associated 
      networks. Such polypharmacological effects may reduce the risk of emerging drug
      resistance by means of attacking the disease networks through synergistic and
      synthetic lethal interactions. However, due to the exponentially increasing
      number of potential drug and target combinations, systematic approaches are
      needed for prioritizing the most potent multi-target alternatives on a global
      network level. We took a functional systems pharmacology approach toward the
      identification of selective target combinations for specific cancer cells by
      combining large-scale screening data on drug treatment efficacies and drug-target
      binding affinities. Our model-based prediction approach, named TIMMA, takes
      advantage of the polypharmacological effects of drugs and infers combinatorial
      drug efficacies through system-level target inhibition networks. Case studies in 
      MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells
      demonstrated how the target inhibition modeling allows systematic exploration of 
      functional interactions between drugs and their targets to maximally inhibit
      multiple survival pathways in a given cancer type. The TIMMA prediction results
      were experimentally validated by means of systematic siRNA-mediated silencing of 
      the selected targets and their pairwise combinations, showing increased ability
      to identify not only such druggable kinase targets that are essential for cancer 
      survival either individually or in combination, but also synergistic interactions
      indicative of non-additive drug efficacies. These system-level analyses were
      enabled by a novel model construction method utilizing maximization and
      minimization rules, as well as a model selection algorithm based on sequential
      forward floating search. Compared with an existing computational solution, TIMMA 
      showed both enhanced prediction accuracies in cross validation as well as
      significant reduction in computation times. Such cost-effective
      computational-experimental design strategies have the potential to greatly
      speed-up the drug testing efforts by prioritizing those interventions and
      interactions warranting further study in individual cancer cases.

TI  - Phosphoproteomic Analyses Reveal Signaling Pathways That Facilitate Lytic
      Gammaherpesvirus Replication.
LID - e1003583
AB  - Lytic gammaherpesvirus (GHV) replication facilitates the establishment of
      lifelong latent infection, which places the infected host at risk for numerous
      cancers. As obligate intracellular parasites, GHVs must control and usurp
      cellular signaling pathways in order to successfully replicate, disseminate to
      stable latency reservoirs in the host, and prevent immune-mediated clearance. To 
      facilitate a systems-level understanding of phosphorylation-dependent signaling
      events directed by GHVs during lytic replication, we utilized label-free
      quantitative mass spectrometry to interrogate the lytic replication cycle of
      murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV68). Compared to controls, MHV68 infection
      regulated by 2-fold or greater ca. 86% of identified phosphopeptides – a
      regulatory scale not previously observed in phosphoproteomic evaluations of
      discrete signal-inducing stimuli. Network analyses demonstrated that the
      infection-associated induction or repression of specific cellular proteins
      globally altered the flow of information through the host phosphoprotein network,
      yielding major changes to functional protein clusters and ontologically
      associated proteins. A series of orthogonal bioinformatics analyses revealed that
      MAPK and CDK-related signaling events were overrepresented in the
      infection-associated phosphoproteome and identified 155 host proteins, such as
      the transcription factor c-Jun, as putative downstream targets. Importantly,
      functional tests of bioinformatics-based predictions confirmed ERK1/2 and CDK1/2 
      as kinases that facilitate MHV68 replication and also demonstrated the importance
      of c-Jun. Finally, a transposon-mutant virus screen identified the MHV68 cyclin D
      ortholog as a viral protein that contributes to the prominent MAPK/CDK signature 
      of the infection-associated phosphoproteome. Together, these analyses enhance an 
      understanding of how GHVs reorganize and usurp intracellular signaling networks
      to facilitate infection and replication.

TI  - Regulation of developmental processes: insights from mass spectrometry-based
      proteomics.
PG  - 723-34
AB  - Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become an indispensable tool for
      protein identification and quantification. In this review, common MS workflows
      are described, with an emphasis on applications of MS-based proteomics in
      developmental biology. Progress has been made in the analysis of proteome changes
      during tissue differentiation and in various genetic perturbations. MS-based
      proteomics has been particularly useful for identifying novel protein
      interactions by affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), many of which
      have been subsequently functionally validated and led to the discovery of
      previously unknown modes of developmental regulation. Quantitative proteomics
      approaches can be used to study post-translational protein modifications (PTMs)
      such as phosphorylation, to reveal the dynamics of intracellular signal
      transduction. Integrative approaches combine quantitative MS-based proteomics
      with other high-throughput methods, with the promise of a systems level
      understanding of developmental regulation.

TI  - HER2 Stabilizes EGFR and Itself by Altering Autophosphorylation Patterns in a
      Manner That Overcomes Regulatory Mechanisms and Promotes Proliferative and
      Transformation Signaling.
PG  - 4169-80
AB  - One of the causes of breast cancer is overexpression of the human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Enhanced receptor autophosphorylation and
      resistance to activation-induced down regulation have been suggested as
      mechanisms for HER2-induced sustained signaling and cell transformation. However,
      the molecular mechanisms underlying these possibilities remain incompletely
      understood. In the current report, we present evidence that show that HER2
      overexpression does not lead to receptor hyper-autophosphorylation, but alters
      patterns in a manner that favors receptor stability and sustained signaling.
      Specifically, HER2 overexpression blocks EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation on Y1045
      and Y1068, the known docking sites of c-Cbl and Grb2, respectively, while
      promoting phosphorylation on Y1173, the known docking site of the Gab adaptor
      proteins and phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ). Under these conditions, HER2 itself is
      phosphorylated on Y1221/1222, with no known role, and on Y1248 that corresponds
      to Y1173 of EGFR. Interestingly, suppressed EGFR autophosphorylation on the Grb2 
      and c-Cbl binding sites correlated with receptor stability and sustained
      signaling, suggesting that HER2 accomplishes these tasks by altering
      autophosphorylation patterns. In conformity with these findings, mutation of the 
      Grb2 binding site on EGFR (Y1068F-EGFR) conferred resistance to ligand-induced
      degradation which in turn induced sustained signaling, and increased cell
      proliferation and transformation. These findings suggest that the Grb2 binding
      site on EGFR is redundant for signaling, but critical for receptor regulation. On
      the other hand, mutation of the putative Grb2 binding site in HER2 (Y1139) did
      not affect stability, signaling or transformation, suggesting that Y1139 in HER2 
      may not serve as a Grb2 binding site. In agreement with the role of EGFR in HER2 
      signaling, inhibition of EGFR expression reduced HER2-induced
      anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis. These results imply that
      complementing HER2-targeted therapies with anti-EGFR drugs may be beneficial in
      HER2-positive breast cancer.

TI  - Convergence in parameters and predictions using computational experimental
      design.
LID - 20130008
AB  - Typically, biological models fitted to experimental data suffer from significant 
      parameter uncertainty, which can lead to inaccurate or uncertain predictions. One
      school of thought holds that accurate estimation of the true parameters of a
      biological system is inherently problematic. Recent work, however, suggests that 
      optimal experimental design techniques can select sets of experiments whose
      members probe complementary aspects of a biochemical network that together can
      account for its full behaviour. Here, we implemented an experimental design
      approach for selecting sets of experiments that constrain parameter uncertainty. 
      We demonstrated with a model of the epidermal growth factor–nerve growth factor
      pathway that, after synthetically performing a handful of optimal experiments,
      the uncertainty in all 48 parameters converged below 10 per cent. Furthermore,
      the fitted parameters converged to their true values with a small error
      consistent with the residual uncertainty. When untested experimental conditions
      were simulated with the fitted models, the predicted species concentrations
      converged to their true values with errors that were consistent with the residual
      uncertainty. This paper suggests that accurate parameter estimation is achievable
      with complementary experiments specifically designed for the task, and that the
      resulting parametrized models are capable of accurate predictions.
