      cardiovascular tissue.
PG  - 168
AB  - Background: Humans and other organisms are equipped with a set of responses that 
      can prevent damage from exposure to a multitude of endogenous and environmental
      stressors. If these stress responses are overwhelmed, this can result in
      pathogenesis of diseases, which is reflected by an increased development of,
      e.g., pulmonary and cardiac diseases in humans exposed to chronic levels of
      environmental stress, including inhaled cigarette smoke (CS). Systems biology
      data sets (e.g., transcriptomics, phosphoproteomics, metabolomics) could enable
      comprehensive investigation of the biological impact of these stressors. However,
      detailed mechanistic networks are needed to determine which specific pathways are
      activated in response to different stressors and to drive the qualitative and
      eventually quantitative assessment of these data. A current limiting step in this
      process is the availability of detailed mechanistic networks that can be used as 
      an analytical substrate. Results: We have built a detailed network model that
      captures the biology underlying the physiological cellular response to endogenous
      and exogenous stressors in non-diseased mammalian pulmonary and cardiovascular
      cells. The contents of the network model reflect several diverse areas of
      signaling, including oxidative stress, hypoxia, shear stress, endoplasmic
      reticulum stress, and xenobiotic stress, that are elicited in response to common 
      pulmonary and cardiovascular stressors. We then tested the ability of the network
      model to identify the mechanisms that are activated in response to CS, a broad
      inducer of cellular stress. Using transcriptomic data from the lungs of mice
      exposed to CS, the network model identified a robust increase in the oxidative
      stress response, largely mediated by the anti-oxidant NRF2 pathways, consistent
      with previous reports on the impact of CS exposure in the mammalian lung.
      Conclusions: The results presented here describe the construction of a cellular
      stress network model and its application towards the analysis of environmental
      stress using transcriptomic data. The proof-of-principle analysis described here,
      coupled with the future development of additional network models covering
      distinct areas of biology, will help to further clarify the integrated biological
      responses elicited by complex environmental stressors such as CS, in pulmonary
      and cardiovascular cells.

TI  - Construction of a computable cell proliferation network focused on non-diseased
      lung cells.
PG  - 105
AB  - Background: Critical to advancing the systems-level evaluation of complex
      biological processes is the development of comprehensive networks and
      computational methods to apply to the analysis of systems biology data
      (transcriptomics, proteomics/phosphoproteomics, metabolomics, etc.). Ideally,
      these networks will be specifically designed to capture the normal, non-diseased 
      biology of the tissue or cell types under investigation, and can be used with
      experimentally generated systems biology data to assess the biological impact of 
      perturbations like xenobiotics and other cellular stresses. Lung cell
      proliferation is a key biological process to capture in such a network model,
      given the pivotal role that proliferation plays in lung diseases including
      cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and fibrosis.
      Unfortunately, no such network has been available prior to this work. Results: To
      further a systems-level assessment of the biological impact of perturbations on
      non-diseased mammalian lung cells, we constructed a lung-focused network for cell
      proliferation. The network encompasses diverse biological areas that lead to the 
      regulation of normal lung cell proliferation (Cell Cycle, Growth Factors, Cell
      Interaction, Intra- and Extracellular Signaling, and Epigenetics), and contains a
      total of 848 nodes (biological entities) and 1597 edges (relationships between
      biological entities). The network was verified using four published gene
      expression profiling data sets associated with measured cell proliferation
      endpoints in lung and lung-related cell types. Predicted changes in the activity 
      of core machinery involved in cell cycle regulation (RB1, CDKN1A, and MYC/MYCN)
      are statistically supported across multiple data sets, underscoring the general
      applicability of this approach for a network-wide biological impact assessment
      using systems biology data. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this
      lung-focused Cell Proliferation Network provides the most comprehensive
      connectivity map in existence of the molecular mechanisms regulating cell
      proliferation in the lung. The network is based on fully referenced causal
      relationships obtained from extensive evaluation of the literature. The
      computable structure of the network enables its application to the qualitative
      and quantitative evaluation of cell proliferation using systems biology data
      sets. The network is available for public use.

TI  - Targeting the MET receptor tyrosine kinase in non-small cell lung cancer:
      emerging role of tivantinib.
PG  - 397-404
AB  - MET receptor tyrosine kinase and its natural ligand, hepatocyte growth factor,
      have been implicated in a variety of cancers, including non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Mechanisms by which cellular deregulation of MET occurs include
      overexpression, genomic amplification, mutation, or alternative splicing. MET
      overexpression or activation is a known cause of acquired resistance to epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in NSCLC. Inhibition of 
      MET signaling in these EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant cells may
      potentially restore sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. Tivantinib (ARQ 197),
      reported as a small-molecule MET inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity
      in early clinical studies. This review focuses on MET and lung cancer, the
      clinical development of tivantinib, the clinical trials of tivantinib in NSCLC to
      date, its current/emerging role in the management of NSCLC, and future
      directions.

TI  - Exosomes in Prostate Cancer: Putting Together the Pieces of a Puzzle.
PG  - 1522-44
AB  - Exosomes have been shown to act as mediators for cell to cell communication and
      as a potential source of biomarkers for many diseases, including prostate cancer.
      Exosomes are nanosized vesicles secreted by cells and consist of proteins
      normally found in multivesicular bodies, RNA, DNA and lipids. As a potential
      source of biomarkers, exosomes have attracted considerable attention, as their
      protein content resembles that of their cells of origin, even though it is noted 
      that the proteins, miRNAs and lipids found in the exosomes are not a reflective
      stoichiometric sampling of the contents from the parent cells. While the
      biogenesis of exosomes in dendritic cells and platelets has been extensively
      characterized, much less is known about the biogenesis of exosomes in cancer
      cells. An understanding of the processes involved in prostate cancer will help to
      further elucidate the role of exosomes and other extracellular vesicles in
      prostate cancer progression and metastasis. There are few methodologies available
      for general isolation of exosomes, however validation of those methodologies is
      necessary to study the role of exosomal-derived biomarkers in various diseases.
      In this review, we discuss “exosomes” as a member of the family of extracellular 
      vesicles and their potential to provide candidate biomarkers for prostate cancer.

TI  - When ubiquitination meets phosphorylation: a systems biology perspective of
      EGFR/MAPK signalling.
PG  - 52
AB  - Ubiquitination, the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins, has
      emerged as a ubiquitous post-translational modification (PTM) whose function
      extends far beyond its original role as a tag for protein degradation identified 
      three decades ago. Although sharing parallel properties with phosphorylation,
      ubiquitination distinguishes itself in important ways. Nevertheless, the
      interplay and crosstalk between ubiquitination and phosphorylation events have
      become a recurrent theme in cell signalling regulation. Understanding how these
      two major PTMs intersect to regulate signal transduction is an important research
      question. In this review, we first discuss the involvement of ubiquitination in
      the regulation of the EGF-mediated ERK signalling pathway via the EGF receptor,
      highlighting the interplay between ubiquitination and phosphorylation in this
      cancer-implicated system and addressing open questions. The roles of
      ubiquitination in pathways crosstalking to EGFR/MAPK signalling will then be
      discussed. In the final part of the review, we demonstrate the rich and versatile
      dynamics of crosstalk between ubiquitination and phosphorylation by using
      quantitative modelling and analysis of network motifs commonly observed in
      cellular processes. We argue that given the overwhelming complexity arising from 
      inter-connected PTMs, a quantitative framework based on systems biology and
      mathematical modelling is needed to efficiently understand their roles in cell
      signalling.

TI  - Alterations of Gab2 signalling complexes in imatinib and dasatinib treated
      chronic myeloid leukaemia cells.
PG  - 30
AB  - Background: The Gab2 docking protein acts as an important signal amplifier
      downstream of various growth factor receptors and Bcr-Abl, the driver of chronic 
      myeloid leukaemia (CML). Despite the success of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKI) in the therapy of CML, TKI-resistance remains an unsolved
      problem in the clinic. We have recently shown that Gab2 signalling counteracts
      the efficacy of four distinct Bcr-Abl inhibitors. In the course of that project, 
      we noticed that two clinically relevant drugs, imatinib and dasatinib, provoke
      distinct alterations in the electrophoretic mobility of Gab2, its signalling
      output and protein interactions. As the signalling potential of the docking
      protein is highly modulated by its phosphorylation status, we set out to obtain
      more insights into the impact of TKIs on Gab2 phosphorylation. Findings: Using
      stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based
      quantitative mass spectrometry (MS), we show now that imatinib and dasatinib
      provoke distinct effects on the phosphorylation status and interactome of Gab2.
      This study identifies several new phosphorylation sites on Gab2 and confirms many
      sites previously known from other experimental systems. At equimolar
      concentrations, dasatinib is more effective in preventing Gab2 tyrosine and
      serine/threonine phosphorylation than imatinib. It also affects the
      phosphorylation status of more residues than imatinib. In addition, we also
      identify novel components of the Gab2 signalling complex, such as casein kinases,
      stathmins and PIP1 as well as known interaction partners whose association with
      Gab2 is disrupted by imatinib and/or dasatinib. Conclusions: By using MS-based
      proteomics, we have identified new and confirmed known phosphorylation sites and 
      interaction partners of Gab2, which may play an important role in the regulation 
      of this docking protein. Given the growing importance of Gab2 in several tumour
      entities we expect that our results will help to understand the complex
      regulation of Gab2 and how this docking protein can contribute to malignancy.

TI  - Structural and functional characteristics of cGMP-dependent methionine oxidation 
      in Arabidopsis thaliana proteins.
PG  - 1
AB  - Background: Increasing structural and biochemical evidence suggests that
      post-translational methionine oxidation of proteins is not just a result of
      cellular damage but may provide the cell with information on the cellular
      oxidative status. In addition, oxidation of methionine residues in key regulatory
      proteins, such as calmodulin, does influence cellular homeostasis. Previous
      findings also indicate that oxidation of methionine residues in signaling
      molecules may have a role in stress responses since these specific structural
      modifications can in turn change biological activities of proteins. Findings:
      Here we use tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics to show that treatment of
      Arabidopsis thaliana cells with a non-oxidative signaling molecule, the
      cell-permeant second messenger analogue, 8-bromo-3,5-cyclic guanosine
      monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP), results in a time-dependent increase in the content of
      oxidised methionine residues. Interestingly, the group of proteins affected by
      cGMP-dependent methionine oxidation is functionally enriched for stress response 
      proteins. Furthermore, we also noted distinct signatures in the frequency of
      amino acids flanking oxidised and un-oxidised methionine residues on both the C- 
      and N-terminus. Conclusions: Given both a structural and functional bias in
      methionine oxidation events in response to a signaling molecule, we propose that 
      these are indicative of a specific role of such post-translational modifications 
      in the direct or indirect regulation of cellular responses. The mechanisms that
      determine the specificity of the modifications remain to be elucidated.

      structural changes of the Caskin1 SH3 domain.
PG  - 36
AB  - Background: Scaffold proteins have an important role in the regulation of signal 
      propagation. These proteins do not possess any enzymatic activity but can
      contribute to the formation of multiprotein complexes. Although scaffold proteins
      are present in all cell types, the nervous system contains them in the largest
      amount. Caskin proteins are typically present in neuronal cells, particularly, in
      the synapses. However, the signaling mechanisms by which Caskin proteins are
      regulated are largely unknown. Results: Here we demonstrate that EphB1 receptor
      tyrosine kinase can recruit Caskin1 through the adaptor protein Nck. Upon
      activation of the receptor kinase, the SH2 domain of Nck binds to one of its
      tyrosine residues, while Nck SH3 domains interact with the proline-rich domain of
      Caskin1. Complex formation of the receptor, adaptor and scaffold proteins results
      in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Caskin1 on its SH3 domain. The phosphorylation
      sites were identified by mass-spectrometry as tyrosines 296 and 336. To reveal
      the structural consequence of this phosphorylation, CD spectroscopy was
      performed. This measurement suggests that upon tyrosine phosphorylation the
      structure of the Caskin1 SH3 domain changes significantly. Conclusion: Taken
      together, we propose that the scaffold protein Caskin1 can form a complex with
      the EphB1 tyrosine kinase via the Nck protein as a linker. Complex formation
      results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the Caskin1 SH3 domain. Although we were
      not able to identify any physiological partner of the SH3 domain so far, we could
      demonstrate that phosphorylation on conserved tyrosine residues results in marked
      changes in the structure of the SH3 domain.

TI  - Functions of the Lyn tyrosine kinase in health and disease.
PG  - 21
AB  - Abstract: Src family kinases such as Lyn are important signaling intermediaries, 
      relaying and modulating different inputs to regulate various outputs, such as
      proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration and metabolism.
      Intriguingly, Lyn can mediate both positive and negative signaling processes
      within the same or different cellular contexts. This duality is exemplified by
      the B-cell defect in Lyn−/− mice in which Lyn is essential for negative
      regulation of the B-cell receptor; conversely, B-cells expressing a dominant
      active mutant of Lyn (Lynup/up) have elevated activities of positive regulators
      of the B-cell receptor due to this hyperactive kinase. Lyn has well-established
      functions in most haematopoietic cells, viz. progenitors via influencing c-kit
      signaling, through to mature cell receptor/integrin signaling, e.g. erythrocytes,
      platelets, mast cells and macrophages. Consequently, there is an important role
      for this kinase in regulating hematopoietic abnormalities. Lyn is an important
      regulator of autoimmune diseases such as asthma and psoriasis, due to its
      profound ability to influence immune cell signaling. Lyn has also been found to
      be important for maintaining the leukemic phenotype of many different liquid
      cancers including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) 
      and B-cell lymphocytic leukaemia (BCLL). Lyn is also expressed in some solid
      tumors and here too it is establishing itself as a potential therapeutic target
      for prostate, glioblastoma, colon and more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. 
      Lay Abstract: To relay information, a cell uses enzymes that put molecular
      markers on specific proteins so they interact with other proteins or move to
      specific parts of the cell to have particular functions. A protein called Lyn is 
      one of these enzymes that regulate information transfer within cells to modulate 
      cell growth, survival and movement. Depending on which type of cell and the
      source of the information input, Lyn can positively or negatively regulate the
      information output. This ability of Lyn to be able to both turn on and turn off
      the relay of information inside cells makes it difficult to fully understand its 
      precise function in each specific circumstance. Lyn has important functions for
      cells involved in blood development, including different while blood cells as
      well as red blood cells, and in particular for the immune cells that produce
      antibodies (B-cells), as exemplified by the major B-cell abnormalities that mice 
      with mutations in the Lyn gene display. Certain types of leukaemia and lymphoma
      appear to have too much Lyn activity that in part causes the characteristics of
      these diseases, suggesting it may be a good target to develop new anti-leukaemia 
      drugs. Furthermore, some specific types, and even specific subtypes, of solid
      cancers, e.g. prostate, brain and breast cancer can also have abnormal regulation
      of Lyn. Consequently, targeting this protein in these cancers could also prove to
      be beneficial.

TI  - Macroscopic law of conservation revealed in the population dynamics of Toll-like 
      receptor signaling.
PG  - 9
AB  - Stimulating the receptors of a single cell generates stochastic intracellular
      signaling. The fluctuating response has been attributed to the low abundance of
      signaling molecules and the spatio-temporal effects of diffusion and crowding. At
      population level, however, cells are able to execute well-defined deterministic
      biological processes such as growth, division, differentiation and immune
      response. These data reflect biology as a system possessing microscopic and
      macroscopic dynamics. This commentary discusses the average population response
      of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and 4 signaling. Without requiring detailed
      experimental data, linear response equations together with the fundamental law of
      information conservation have been used to decipher novel network features such
      as unknown intermediates, processes and cross-talk mechanisms. For single cell
      response, however, such simplicity seems far from reality. Thus, as observed in
      any other complex systems, biology can be considered to possess order and
      disorder, inheriting a mixture of predictable population level and unpredictable 
      single cell outcomes.

AB  - Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are fatal
      diseases associated with the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) to
      the abnormal prion protein (PrPSc). Since the molecular mechanisms in
      pathogenesis are widely unclear, we analyzed the global phospho-proteome and
      detected a differential pattern of tyrosine- and threonine phosphorylated
      proteins in PrPSc-replicating and pentosan polysulfate (PPS)-rescued N2a cells in
      two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. To quantify phosphorylated proteins, we
      performed a SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)
      analysis and identified 105 proteins, which showed a regulated phosphorylation
      upon PrPSc infection. Among those proteins, we validated the dephosphorylation of
      stathmin and Cdc2 and the induced phosphorylation of cofilin in PrPSc-infected
      N2a cells in Western blot analyses. Our analysis showed for the first time a
      differentially regulated phospho-proteome in PrPSc infection, which could
      contribute to the establishment of novel protein markers and to the development
      of novel therapeutic intervention strategies in targeting prion-associated
      disease.

TI  - Early cellular signaling responses to axonal injury.
PG  - 5
AB  - Background: We have used optic nerve injury as a model to study early signaling
      events in neuronal tissue following axonal injury. Optic nerve injury results in 
      the selective death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The time course of cell
      death takes place over a period of days with the earliest detection of RGC death 
      at about 48 hr post injury. We hypothesized that in the period immediately
      following axonal injury, there are changes in the soma that signal surrounding
      glia and neurons and that start programmed cell death. In the current study, we
      investigated early changes in cellular signaling and gene expression that occur
      within the first 6 hrs post optic nerve injury. Results: We found evidence of
      cell to cell signaling within 30 min of axonal injury. We detected differences in
      phosphoproteins and gene expression within the 6 hrs time period. Activation of
      TNFα and glutamate receptors, two pathways that can initiate cell death, begins
      in RGCs within 6 hrs following axonal injury. Differential gene expression at 6
      hrs post injury included genes involved in cytokine, neurotrophic factor
      signaling (Socs3) and apoptosis (Bax). Conclusion: We interpret our studies to
      indicate that both neurons and glia in the retina have been signaled within 30
      min after optic nerve injury. The signals are probably initiated by the RGC soma.
      In addition, signals activating cellular death pathways occur within 6 hrs of
      injury, which likely lead to RGC degeneration.

PG  - 304-30
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play essential roles in cellular processes,
      including metabolism, cell-cycle control, survival, proliferation, motility and
      differentiation. RTKs are all synthesized as single-pass transmembrane proteins
      and bind polypeptide ligands, mainly growth factors. It has long been thought
      that all RTKs, except for the insulin receptor (IR) family, are activated by
      ligand-induced dimerization of the receptors. An increasing number of diverse
      studies, however, indicate that RTKs, previously thought to exist as monomers,
      are present as pre-formed, yet inactive, dimers prior to ligand binding. The
      non-covalently associated dimeric structures are reminiscent of those of the IR
      family, which has a disulfide-linked dimeric structure. Furthermore, recent
      progress in structural studies has provided insight into the underpinnings of
      conformational changes during the activation of RTKs. In this review, I discuss
      two mutually exclusive models for the mechanisms of activation of the epidermal
      growth factor receptor, the neurotrophin receptor and IR families, based on these
      new insights.

TI  - The effect of disease on human cardiac protein expression profiles in paired
      samples from right and left ventricles.
PG  - 34
AB  - Background: Cardiac diseases (e.g. coronary and valve) are associated with
      ventricular cellular remodeling. However, ventricular biopsies from left and
      right ventricles from patients with different pathologies are rare and thus
      little is known about disease-induced cellular remodeling in both sides of the
      heart and between different diseases. We hypothesized that the protein expression
      profiles between right and left ventricles of patients with aortic valve stenosis
      (AVS) and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are different and that the 
      protein profile is different between the two diseases. Left and right ventricular
      biopsies were collected from patients with either CAD or AVS. The biopsies were
      processed for proteomic analysis using isobaric tandem mass tagging and analyzed 
      by reverse phase nano-LC-MS/MS. Western blot for selected proteins showed strong 
      correlation with proteomic analysis. Results: Proteomic analysis between
      ventricles of the same disease (intra-disease) and between ventricles of
      different diseases (inter-disease) identified more than 500 proteins detected in 
      all relevant ventricular biopsies. Comparison between ventricles and disease
      state was focused on proteins with relatively high fold (±1.2 fold difference)
      and significant (P < 0.05) differences. Intra-disease protein expression
      differences between left and right ventricles were largely structural for AVS
      patients and largely signaling/metabolism for CAD. Proteins commonly associated
      with hypertrophy were also different in the AVS group but with lower fold
      difference. Inter-disease differences between left ventricles of AVS and CAD were
      detected in 9 proteins. However, inter-disease differences between the right
      ventricles of CAD and AVS patients were associated with differences in 73
      proteins. The majority of proteins which had a significant difference in one
      ventricle compared to the other pathology also had a similar trend in the
      adjacent ventricle. Conclusions: This work demonstrates for the first time that
      left and right ventricles have a different proteome and that the difference is
      dependent on the type of disease. Inter-disease differential expression was more 
      prominent for right ventricles. The finding that a protein change in one
      ventricle was often associated with a similar trend in the adjacent ventricle for
      a large number of proteins suggests cross-talk proteome remodeling between
      adjacent ventricles.

TI  - Proteogenomic convergence for understanding cancer pathways and networks.
PG  - 22
AB  - During the past several decades, the understanding of cancer at the molecular
      level has been primarily focused on mechanisms on how signaling molecules
      transform homeostatically balanced cells into malignant ones within an individual
      pathway. However, it is becoming more apparent that pathways are dynamic and
      crosstalk at different control points of the signaling cascades, making the
      traditional linear signaling models inadequate to interpret complex biological
      systems. Recent technological advances in high throughput, deep sequencing for
      the human genomes and proteomic technologies to comprehensively characterize the 
      human proteomes in conjunction with multiplexed targeted proteomic assays to
      measure panels of proteins involved in biologically relevant pathways have made
      significant progress in understanding cancer at the molecular level. It is
      undeniable that proteomic profiling of differentially expressed proteins under
      many perturbation conditions, or between normal and “diseased” states is
      important to capture a first glance at the overall proteomic landscape, which has
      been a main focus of proteomics research during the past 15-20 years. However,
      the research community is gradually shifting its heavy focus from that initial
      discovery step to protein target verification using multiplexed quantitative
      proteomic assays, capable of measuring changes in proteins and their interacting 
      partners, isoforms, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in response to
      stimuli in the context of signaling pathways and protein networks. With a
      critical link to genotypes (i.e., high throughput genomics and transcriptomics
      data), new and complementary information can be gleaned from multi-dimensional
      omics data to (1) assess the effect of genomic and transcriptomic aberrations on 
      such complex molecular machinery in the context of cell signaling architectures
      associated with pathological diseases such as cancer (i.e., from genotype to
      proteotype to phenotype); and (2) target pathway- and network-driven changes and 
      map the fluctuations of these functional units (proteins) responsible for
      cellular activities in response to perturbation in a spatiotemporal fashion to
      better understand cancer biology as a whole system.

TI  - Proteomic analysis of ERK1/2-mediated human sickle red blood cell membrane
      protein phosphorylation.
PG  - 1
AB  - Background: In sickle cell disease (SCD), the mitogen-activated protein kinase
      (MAPK) ERK1/2 is constitutively active and can be inducible by
      agonist-stimulation only in sickle but not in normal human red blood cells
      (RBCs). ERK1/2 is involved in activation of ICAM-4-mediated sickle RBC adhesion
      to the endothelium. However, other effects of the ERK1/2 activation in sickle
      RBCs leading to the complex SCD pathophysiology, such as alteration of RBC
      hemorheology are unknown. Results: To further characterize global ERK1/2-induced 
      changes in membrane protein phosphorylation within human RBCs, a label-free
      quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis was applied to sickle and normal RBC
      membrane ghosts pre-treated with U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2, the
      upstream kinase of ERK1/2, in the presence or absence of recombinant active ERK2.
      Across eight unique treatment groups, 375 phosphopeptides from 155
      phosphoproteins were quantified with an average technical coefficient of
      variation in peak intensity of 19.8%. Sickle RBC treatment with U0126 decreased
      thirty-six phosphopeptides from twenty-one phosphoproteins involved in regulation
      of not only RBC shape, flexibility, cell morphology maintenance and adhesion, but
      also glucose and glutamate transport, cAMP production, degradation of misfolded
      proteins and receptor ubiquitination. Glycophorin A was the most affected protein
      in sickle RBCs by this ERK1/2 pathway, which contained 12 unique phosphorylated
      peptides, suggesting that in addition to its effect on sickle RBC adhesion,
      increased glycophorin A phosphorylation via the ERK1/2 pathway may also affect
      glycophorin A interactions with band 3, which could result in decreases in both
      anion transport by band 3 and band 3 trafficking. The abundance of twelve of the 
      thirty-six phosphopeptides were subsequently increased in normal RBCs
      co-incubated with recombinant ERK2 and therefore represent specific MEK1/2
      phospho-inhibitory targets mediated via ERK2. Conclusions: These findings expand 
      upon the current model for the involvement of ERK1/2 signaling in RBCs. These
      findings also identify additional protein targets of this pathway other than the 
      RBC adhesion molecule ICAM-4 and enhance the understanding of the mechanism of
      small molecule inhibitors of MEK/1/2/ERK1/2, which could be effective in
      ameliorating RBC hemorheology and adhesion, the hallmarks of SCD.

      interaction networks and dynamical network biomarkers (DNB). Disease-specific
      interaction networks, network biomarkers, or DNB have great significance in the
      understanding of molecular pathogenesis, risk assessment, disease classification 
      and monitoring, or evaluations of therapeutic responses and toxicities.
      Protein-based DNB will provide more information to define the differences between
      the normal and pre-disease stages, which might point to early diagnosis for
      patients. Clinical bioinformatics should be a key approach to the identification 
      and validation of disease-specific biomarkers.

      as affinity purification followed by MS have also been used to elucidate relevant
      biological questions in health and disease.The study of proteomes and

      clinically useful in the near future.Here, we provide an overview of general
      principles of signaling pathways versus phosphorylation. Likewise, we detail
      chemical phosphoproteomic tools, including pros and cons with examples where
      these methods have been applied. In addition, basic clues of electrospray
      ionization and collision induced dissociation fragmentation are detailed in a

TI  - Relevant phosphoproteomic and mass spectrometry: approaches useful in clinical
      research.
PG  - 2
AB  - Background: "It's not what we do, it's the way that we do it". Never has this
      maxim been truer in proteomics than now. Mass Spectrometry-based
      proteomics/phosphoproteomics tools are critical to understand the structure and
      dynamics (spatial and temporal) of signalling that engages and migrates through
      the entire proteome. Approaches such as affinity purification followed by Mass
      Spectrometry (MS) have been used to elucidate relevant biological questions
      disease vs. health. Thousands of proteins interact via physical and chemical
      association. Moreover, certain proteins can covalently modify other proteins
      post-translationally. These post-translational modifications (PTMs) ultimately
      give rise to the emergent functions of cells in sequence, space and time.
      Findings: Understanding the functions of phosphorylated proteins thus requires
      one to study proteomes as linked-systems rather than collections of individual
      protein molecules. Indeed, the interacting proteome or protein-network knowledge 
      has recently received much attention, as network-systems (signalling pathways)
      are effective snapshots in time, of the proteome as a whole. MS approaches are
      clearly essential, in spite of the difficulties of some low abundance proteins
      for future clinical advances. Conclusion: Clinical proteomics-MS has come a long 
      way in the past decade in terms of technology/platform development, protein
      chemistry, and together with bioinformatics and other OMICS tools to identify
      molecular signatures of diseases based on protein pathways and signalling
      cascades. Hence, there is great promise for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and
      prediction of therapeutic outcome on an individualized basis. However, and as a
      general rule, without correct study design, strategy and implementation of robust
      analytical methodologies, the efforts, efficiency and expectations to make
      biomarkers (especially phosphorylated kinases) a useful reality in the near
      future, can easily be hampered.

TI  - RegPhos 2.0: an updated resource to explore protein kinase–substrate
      phosphorylation networks in mammals.
LID - bau034
AB  - Protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial roles in regulating a 
      variety of intracellular processes. Owing to an increasing number of in vivo
      phosphorylation sites that have been identified by mass spectrometry (MS)-based
      proteomics, the RegPhos, available online at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/RegPhos2/,
      was developed to explore protein phosphorylation networks in human. In this
      update, we not only enhance the data content in human but also investigate
      kinase–substrate phosphorylation networks in mouse and rat. The experimentally
      validated phosphorylation sites as well as their catalytic kinases were extracted
      from public resources, and MS/MS phosphopeptides were manually curated from
      research articles. RegPhos 2.0 aims to provide a more comprehensive view of
      intracellular signaling networks by integrating the information of metabolic
      pathways and protein–protein interactions. A case study shows that analyzing the 
      phosphoproteome profile of time-dependent cell activation obtained from Liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, the RegPhos deciphered not 
      only the consistent scheme in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway but also
      novel regulatory molecules that may involve in it. With an attempt to help users 
      efficiently identify the candidate biomarkers in cancers, 30 microarray
      experiments, including 39 cancerous versus normal cells, were analyzed for
      detecting cancer-specific expressed genes coding for kinases and their
      substrates. Furthermore, this update features an improved web interface to
      facilitate convenient access to the exploration of phosphorylation networks for a
      group of genes/proteins.Database URL: http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/RegPhos2/

TI  - TSLP signaling pathway map: a platform for analysis of TSLP-mediated signaling.
LID - bau007
AB  - Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a four-helix bundle cytokine that plays a 
      critical role in the regulation of immune responses and in the differentiation of
      hematopoietic cells. TSLP signals through a heterodimeric receptor complex
      consisting of an interleukin-7 receptor α chain and a unique TSLP receptor
      (TSLPR) [also known as cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2)]. Cellular targets
      of TSLP include dendritic cells, B cells, mast cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells
      and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The TSLP/TSLPR axis can activate multiple signaling
      transduction pathways including the JAK/STAT pathway and the PI-3 kinase pathway.
      Aberrant TSLP/TSLPR signaling has been associated with a variety of human
      diseases including asthma, atopic dermatitis, nasal polyposis, inflammatory bowel
      disease, eosinophilic eosophagitis and, most recently, acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia. A centralized resource of the TSLP signaling pathway cataloging
      signaling events is not yet available. In this study, we present a
      literature-annotated resource of reactions in the TSLP signaling pathway. This
      pathway map is publicly available through NetPath (http://www.netpath.org/), an
      open access signal transduction pathway resource developed previously by our
      group. This map includes 236 molecules and 252 reactions that are involved in
      TSLP/TSLPR signaling pathway. We expect that the TSLP signaling pathway map will 
      provide a rich resource to study the biology of this important cytokine as well
      as to identify novel therapeutic targets for diseases associated with
      dysregulated TSLP/TSLPR signaling.Database URL:

TI  - ANIA: ANnotation and Integrated Analysis of the 14-3-3 interactome.
LID - bat085
AB  - The dimeric 14-3-3 proteins dock onto pairs of phosphorylated Ser and Thr
      residues on hundreds of proteins, and thereby regulate many events in mammalian
      cells. To facilitate global analyses of these interactions, we developed a web
      resource named ANIA: ANnotation and Integrated Analysis of the 14-3-3
      interactome, which integrates multiple data sets on 14-3-3-binding
      phosphoproteins. ANIA also pinpoints candidate 14-3-3-binding phosphosites using 
      predictor algorithms, assisted by our recent discovery that the human
      14-3-3-interactome is highly enriched in 2R-ohnologues. 2R-ohnologues are
      proteins in families of two to four, generated by two rounds of whole genome
      duplication at the origin of the vertebrate animals. ANIA identifies candidate
      ‘lynchpins’, which are 14-3-3-binding phosphosites that are conserved across
      members of a given 2R-ohnologue protein family. Other features of ANIA include a 
      link to the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer database to find cancer
      polymorphisms that map to 14-3-3-binding phosphosites, which would be expected to
      interfere with 14-3-3 interactions. We used ANIA to map known and candidate
      14-3-3-binding enzymes within the 2R-ohnologue complement of the human kinome.
      Our projections indicate that 14-3-3s dock onto many more human kinases than has 
      been realized. Guided by ANIA, PAK4, 6 and 7 (p21-activated kinases 4, 6 and 7)
      were experimentally validated as a 2R-ohnologue family of 14-3-3-binding
      phosphoproteins. PAK4 binding to 14-3-3 is stimulated by phorbol ester, and
      involves the ‘lynchpin’ site phosphoSer99 and a major contribution from Ser181.
      In contrast, PAK6 and PAK7 display strong phorbol ester-independent binding to
      14-3-3, with Ser113 critical for the interaction with PAK6. These data point to
      differential 14-3-3 regulation of PAKs in control of cell morphology.Database

TI  - A secretory kinase complex regulates extracellular protein phosphorylation.
LID - e06120
AB  - Although numerous extracellular phosphoproteins have been identified, the protein
      kinases within the secretory pathway have only recently been discovered, and
      their regulation is virtually unexplored. Fam20C is the physiological Golgi
      casein kinase, which phosphorylates many secreted proteins and is critical for
      proper biomineralization. Fam20A, a Fam20C paralog, is essential for enamel
      formation, but the biochemical function of Fam20A is unknown. Here we show that
      Fam20A potentiates Fam20C kinase activity and promotes the phosphorylation of
      enamel matrix proteins in vitro and in cells. Mechanistically, Fam20A is a
      pseudokinase that forms a functional complex with Fam20C, and this complex
      enhances extracellular protein phosphorylation within the secretory pathway. Our 
      findings shed light on the molecular mechanism by which Fam20C and Fam20A
      collaborate to control enamel formation, and provide the first insight into the
      regulation of secretory pathway
      phosphorylation.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06120.001

TI  - Regulation of EGFR signal transduction by analogue-to-digital conversion in
      endosomes.
LID - e06156
AB  - An outstanding question is how receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) determine
      different cell-fate decisions despite sharing the same signalling cascades. Here,
      we uncovered an unexpected mechanism of RTK trafficking in this process. By
      quantitative high-resolution FRET microscopy, we found that phosphorylated
      epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR) is not randomly distributed but
      packaged at constant mean amounts in endosomes. Cells respond to higher EGF
      concentrations by increasing the number of endosomes but keeping the mean p-EGFR 
      content per endosome almost constant. By mathematical modelling, we found that
      this mechanism confers both robustness and regulation to signalling output.
      Different growth factors caused specific changes in endosome number and size in
      various cell systems and changing the distribution of p-EGFR between endosomes
      was sufficient to reprogram cell-fate decision upon EGF stimulation. We propose
      that the packaging of p-RTKs in endosomes is a general mechanism to ensure the
      fidelity and specificity of the signalling
      response.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06156.001

TI  - Talking to chromatin: post-translational modulation of polycomb group function.
PG  - 10
AB  - Polycomb Group proteins are important epigenetic regulators of gene expression.
      Epigenetic control by polycomb Group proteins involves intrinsic as well as
      associated enzymatic activities. Polycomb target genes change with cellular
      context, lineage commitment and differentiation status, revealing dynamic
      regulation of polycomb function. It is currently unclear how this dynamic
      modulation is controlled and how signaling affects polycomb-mediated epigenetic
      processes at the molecular level. Experimental evidence on regulation of polycomb
      function by post-translational mechanisms is steadily emerging: Polycomb Group
      proteins are targeted for ubiquitylation, sumoylation and phosphorylation. In
      addition, specific Polycomb Group proteins modify other (chromatin) associated
      proteins via similar post-translational modifications. Such modifications affect 
      protein function by affecting protein stability, protein-protein interactions and
      enzymatic activities. Here, we review current insights in covalent modification
      of Polycomb Group proteins in the context of protein function and present a
      tentative view of integrated signaling to chromatin in the context of
      phosphorylation. Clearly, the available literature reveals just the tip of the
      iceberg, and exact molecular mechanisms in, and the biological relevance of
      post-translational regulation of polycomb function await further elucidation. Our
      understanding of causes and consequences of post-translational modification of
      polycomb proteins will gain significantly from in vivo validation experiments.
      Impaired polycomb function has important repercussions for stem cell function,
      development and disease. Ultimately, increased understanding of signaling to
      chromatin and the mechanisms involved in epigenetic remodeling will contribute to
      the development of therapeutic interventions in cell fate decisions in
      development and disease.

TI  - Use and Isolation of Urinary Exosomes as Biomarkers for Diabetic Nephropathy.
LID - 149
AB  - Diabetes represents a major threat to public health and the number of patients is
      increasing alarmingly in the global scale. Particularly, the diabetic kidney
      disease (nephropathy, DN) together with its cardiovascular complications cause
      immense human suffering, highly increased risk of premature deaths, and lead to
      huge societal costs. DN is first detected when protein appears in urine
      (microalbuminuria). As in other persisting proteinuric diseases (like vasculitis)
      it heralds irreversible damage of kidney functions up to non-functional
      (end-stage) kidney and ultimately calls for kidney replacement therapy (dialysis 
      or kidney transplantation). While remarkable progress has been made in
      understanding the genetic and molecular factors associating with chronic kidney
      diseases, breakthroughs are still missing to provide comprehensive understanding 
      of events and mechanisms associated. Non-invasive diagnostic tools for early
      diagnostics of kidney damage are badly needed. Exosomes – small vesicular
      structures present in urine are released by all cell types along kidney
      structures to present with distinct surface assembly. Furthermore, exosomes carry
      a load of special proteins and nucleic acids. This “cargo” faithfully reflects
      the physiological state of their respective cells of origin and appears to serve 
      as a new pathway for downstream signaling to target cells. Accordingly, exosome
      vesicles are emerging as a valuable source for disease stage-specific information
      and as fingerprints of disease progression. Unfortunately, technical issues of
      exosome isolation are challenging and, thus, their full potential remains
      untapped. Here, we review the molecular basis of exosome secretion as well as
      their use to reveal events along the nephron. In addition to novel molecular
      information, the new methods provide the needed accurate, personalized,
      non-invasive, and inexpensive future diagnostics.

TI  - Molecular Basis of Signaling Specificity of Insulin and IGF Receptors: Neglected 
      Corners and Recent Advances.
LID - 34
AB  - Insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors utilize common
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
      signaling pathways to mediate a broad spectrum of “metabolic” and “mitogenic”
      responses. Specificity of insulin and IGF action in vivo must in part reflect
      expression of receptors and responsive pathways in different tissues but it is
      widely assumed that it is also determined by the ligand binding and signaling
      mechanisms of the receptors. This review focuses on receptor-proximal events in
      insulin/IGF signaling and examines their contribution to specificity of
      downstream responses. Insulin and IGF receptors may differ subtly in the
      efficiency with which they recruit their major substrates (IRS-1 and IRS-2 and
      Shc) and this could influence effectiveness of signaling to “metabolic” and
      “mitogenic” responses. Other substrates (Grb2-associated binder, downstream of
      kinases, SH2Bs, Crk), scaffolds (RACK1, β-arrestins, cytohesins), and pathways
      (non-receptor tyrosine kinases, phosphoinositide kinases, reactive oxygen
      species) have been less widely studied. Some of these components appear to be
      specifically involved in “metabolic” or “mitogenic” signaling but it has not been
      shown that this reflects receptor-preferential interaction. Very few
      receptor-specific interactions have been characterized, and their roles in
      signaling are unclear. Signaling specificity might also be imparted by
      differences in intracellular trafficking or feedback regulation of receptors, but
      few studies have directly addressed this possibility. Although published data are
      not wholly conclusive, no evidence has yet emerged for signaling mechanisms that 
      are specifically engaged by insulin receptors but not IGF receptors or vice
      versa, and there is only limited evidence for differential activation of
      signaling mechanisms that are common to both receptors. Cellular context, rather 
      than intrinsic receptor activity, therefore appears to be the major determinant
      of whether responses to insulin and IGFs are perceived as “metabolic” or
      “mitogenic.”

AB  - During development, multicellular organisms must become sexually mature in order 
      to reproduce. The developmental timing of this transition is controlled by pulses
      of steroid hormones, but how these pulses are generated have remained unclear? A 
      recent paper shows that in Drosophila larvae, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of
      DHR4, a nuclear receptor, in response to prothoracicotropic hormone signaling, is
      critical for producing the correct temporal pulses of steroid hormones that
      coordinate the juvenile–adult transition.

TI  - Toward a systems-level view of dynamic phosphorylation networks.
LID - 263
AB  - To better understand how cells sense and respond to their environment, it is
      important to understand the organization and regulation of the phosphorylation
      networks that underlie most cellular signal transduction pathways. These
      networks, which are composed of protein kinases, protein phosphatases and their
      respective cellular targets, are highly dynamic. Importantly, to achieve
      signaling specificity, phosphorylation networks must be regulated at several
      levels, including at the level of protein expression, substrate recognition, and 
      spatiotemporal modulation of enzymatic activity. Here, we briefly summarize some 
      of the traditional methods used to study the phosphorylation status of cellular
      proteins before focusing our attention on several recent technological advances, 
      such as protein microarrays, quantitative mass spectrometry, and
      genetically-targetable fluorescent biosensors, that are offering new insights
      into the organization and regulation of cellular phosphorylation networks.
      Together, these approaches promise to lead to a systems-level view of dynamic
      phosphorylation networks.

TI  - Combining affinity proteomics and network context to identify new phosphatase
      substrates and adapters in growth pathways.
LID - 115
AB  - Protein phosphorylation homoeostasis is tightly controlled and pathological
      conditions are caused by subtle alterations of the cell phosphorylation profile. 
      Altered levels of kinase activities have already been associated to specific
      diseases. Less is known about the impact of phosphatases, the enzymes that
      down-regulate phosphorylation by removing the phosphate groups. This is partly
      due to our poor understanding of the phosphatase-substrate network. Much of
      phosphatase substrate specificity is not based on intrinsic enzyme specificity
      with the catalytic pocket recognizing the sequence/structure context of the
      phosphorylated residue. In addition many phosphatase catalytic subunits do not
      form a stable complex with their substrates. This makes the inference and
      validation of phosphatase substrates a non-trivial task. Here, we present a novel
      approach that builds on the observation that much of phosphatase substrate
      selection is based on the network of physical interactions linking the
      phosphatase to the substrate. We first used affinity proteomics coupled to
      quantitative mass spectrometry to saturate the interactome of eight phosphatases 
      whose down regulations was shown to affect the activation of the RAS-PI3K
      pathway. By integrating information from functional siRNA with protein
      interaction information, we develop a strategy that aims at inferring phosphatase
      physiological substrates. Graph analysis is used to identify protein scaffolds
      that may link the catalytic subunits to their substrates. By this approach we
      rediscover several previously described phosphatase substrate interactions and
      characterize two new protein scaffolds that promote the dephosphorylation of
      PTPN11 and ERK by DUSP18 and DUSP26, respectively.

TI  - Exosomal miRNAs: Biological Properties and Therapeutic Potential.
LID - 56
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding regulatory RNAs that regulate gene
      expression at the post-transcriptional level, are master regulators of a wide
      array of cellular processes. Altered miRNA expression could be a determinant of
      disease development and/or progression and manipulation of miRNA expression
      represents a potential avenue of therapy. Exosomes are cell-derived extracellular
      vesicles that promote cell–cell communication and immunoregulatory functions.
      These “bioactive vesicles” shuttle various molecules, including miRNAs, to
      recipient cells. Inappropriate release of miRNAs from exosomes may cause
      significant alterations in biological pathways that affect disease development,
      supporting the concept that miRNA-containing exosomes could serve as targeted
      therapies for particular diseases. This review briefly summarizes recent advances
      in the biology, function, and therapeutic potential of exosomal miRNAs.

TI  - Chemokine Receptor-Specific Antibodies in Cancer Immunotherapy: Achievements and 
      Challenges.
LID - 12
AB  - The 1990s brought a burst of information regarding the structure, expression
      pattern, and role in leukocyte migration and adhesion of chemokines and their
      receptors. At that time, the FDA approved the first therapeutic antibodies for
      cancer treatment. A few years later, it was reported that the chemokine receptors
      CXCR4 and CCR7 were involved on directing metastases to liver, lung, bone marrow,
      or lymph nodes, and the over-expression of CCR4, CCR6, and CCR9 by certain
      tumors. The possibility of inhibiting the interaction of chemokine receptors
      present on the surface of tumor cells with their ligands emerged as a new
      therapeutic approach. Therefore, many research groups and companies began to
      develop small molecule antagonists and specific antibodies, aiming to neutralize 
      signaling from these receptors. Despite great expectations, so far, only one
      anti-chemokine receptor antibody has been approved for its clinical use,
      mogamulizumab, an anti-CCR4 antibody, granted in Japan to treat refractory adult 
      T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. Here, we review the main achievements obtained with
      anti-chemokine receptor antibodies for cancer immunotherapy, including discovery 
      and clinical studies, proposed mechanisms of action, and therapeutic
      applications.

TI  - An Interaction Library for the FcεRI Signaling Network.
LID - 172
AB  - Antigen receptors play a central role in adaptive immune responses. Although the 
      molecular networks associated with these receptors have been extensively studied,
      we currently lack a systems-level understanding of how combinations of
      non-covalent interactions and post-translational modifications are regulated
      during signaling to impact cellular decision-making. To fill this knowledge gap, 
      it will be necessary to formalize and piece together information about individual
      molecular mechanisms to form large-scale computational models of signaling
      networks. To this end, we have developed an interaction library for signaling by 
      the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcεRI. The library consists of executable rules
      for protein–protein and protein–lipid interactions. This library extends earlier 
      models for FcεRI signaling and introduces new interactions that have not
      previously been considered in a model. Thus, this interaction library is a
      toolkit with which existing models can be expanded and from which new models can 
      be built. As an example, we present models of branching pathways from the adaptor
      protein Lat, which influence production of the phospholipid PIP3 at the plasma
      membrane and the soluble second messenger IP3. We find that inclusion of a
      positive feedback loop gives rise to a bistable switch, which may ensure robust
      responses to stimulation above a threshold level. In addition, the library is
      visualized to facilitate understanding of network circuitry and identification of
      network motifs.

AB  - The predominant expression of the γ and δ isoforms of PI3K in cells of
      hematopoietic lineage prompted speculation that inhibitors of these isoforms
      could offer opportunities for selective targeting of PI3K in the immune system in
      a range of immune-related pathologies. While there has been some success in
      developing PI3Kδ inhibitors, progress in developing selective inhibitors of PI3Kγ
      has been rather disappointing. This has prompted the search for alternative
      targets with which to modulate PI3K signaling specifically in the immune system. 
      One such target is the SH2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase-1 (SHIP-1)
      which de-phosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P3 at the D5 position of the inositol ring to
      create PI(3,4)P2. In this article, we first describe the current state of PI3K
      isoform-selective inhibitor development. We then focus on the structure of SHIP-1
      and its function in the immune system. Finally, we consider the current state of 
      development of small molecule compounds that potently and selectively modulate
      SHIP activity and which offer novel opportunities to manipulate PI3K mediated
      signaling in the immune system.

TI  - gp130 cytokines are positive signals triggering changes in gene expression and
      axon outgrowth in peripheral neurons following injury.
LID - 62
AB  - Adult peripheral neurons, in contrast to adult central neurons, are capable of
      regeneration after axonal damage. Much attention has focused on the changes that 
      accompany this regeneration in two places, the distal nerve segment (where
      phagocytosis of axonal debris, changes in the surface properties of Schwann
      cells, and induction of growth factors and cytokines occur) and the neuronal cell
      body (where dramatic changes in cell morphology and gene expression occur). The
      changes in the axotomized cell body are often referred to as the “cell body
      response.” The focus of the current review is a family of cytokines, the
      glycoprotein 130 (gp130) cytokines, which produce their actions through a common 
      gp130 signaling receptor and which function as injury signals for axotomized
      peripheral neurons, triggering changes in gene expression and in neurite
      outgrowth. These cytokines play important roles in the responses of sympathetic, 
      sensory, and motor neurons to injury. The best studied of these cytokines in this
      context are leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin (IL)-6, but
      experiments with conditional gp130 knockout animals suggest that other members of
      this family, not yet determined, are also involved. The primary gp130 signaling
      pathway shown to be involved is the activation of Janus kinase (JAK) and the
      transcription factors Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT), 
      though other downstream pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase
      (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) may also play a role. gp130
      signaling may involve paracrine, retrograde, and autocrine actions of these
      cytokines. Recent studies suggest that manipulation of this cytokine system can
      also stimulate regeneration by injured central neurons.

TI  - The nuclear events guiding successful nerve regeneration.
LID - 53
AB  - Peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons survive and regenerate after nerve
      injury, whereas central nervous system (CNS) neurons lack the capacity to do so. 
      The inability of the CNS to regenerate presumably results from a lack of
      intrinsic growth activity and a permissive environment. To achieve CNS
      regeneration, we can learn from successful nerve regeneration in the PNS. Neurons
      in the PNS elicit dynamic changes in gene expression in response to permissive
      environmental cues following nerve injury. To switch gene expression on and off
      in injured neurons, transcription factors and their networks should be carefully 
      orchestrated according to the regeneration program. This is the so-called
      “intrinsic power of axonal growth.” There is an increasing repertoire of
      candidate transcription factors induced by nerve injury. Some of them potentiate 
      the survival and axonal regeneration of damaged neurons in vivo; however, our
      knowledge of transcriptional events in injured neurons is still limited. How do
      these transcription factors communicate with each other? How does the
      transcriptional machinery regulate the wide variety of regeneration-associated
      genes (RAGs) in the properly coordinated manner? In this review, we describe our 
      current understanding of the injury-inducible transcriptional factors that
      enhance the intrinsic growth capacity, and propose a potential role for
      specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which provides a platform to recruit
      injury-inducible transcription factors, in simultaneous gene regulation. Finally,
      we discuss an additional mechanism that is involved in epigenetic modifications
      in damaged neurons. A comprehensive understanding of the nuclear events in
      injured neurons will provide clues to clinical interventions for successful nerve
      regeneration.

LID - 95
AB  - The treatment of melanoma by targeted inhibition of the mutated kinase BRAF with 
      small molecules only temporarily suppresses metastatic disease. In the face of
      chemical inhibition tumor plasticity, both innate and adaptive, promotes survival
      through the biochemical and genetic reconfiguration of cellular pathways that can
      engage proliferative and migratory systems. To investigate this process,
      high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to characterize the phosphoproteome of
      this transition in vitro. A simple and accurate, label-free quantitative method
      was used to localize and quantitate thousands of phosphorylation events. We also 
      correlated changes in the phosphoproteome with the proteome to more accurately
      determine changes in the activity of regulatory kinases determined by kinase
      landscape profiling. The abundance of phosphopeptides with sites that function in
      cytoskeletal regulation, GTP/GDP exchange, protein kinase C, IGF signaling, and
      melanosome maturation were highly divergent after transition to a drug resistant 
      phenotype.

TI  - The Emerging Role of Exosomes in Epithelial–Mesenchymal-Transition in Cancer.
LID - 361
AB  - Metastasis in cancer consists of multiple steps, including
      epithelial–mesenchymal-transition (EMT), which is characterized by the loss of
      epithelial-like characteristics and the gain of mesenchymal-like attributes
      including cell migration and invasion. It is clear that the tumor
      microenvironment can promote the metastatic cascade and that intercellular
      communication is necessary for this to occur. Exosomes are small membranous
      vesicles secreted by most cell types into the extracellular environment and they 
      are important communicators in the tumor microenvironment. They promote
      angiogenesis, invasion, and proliferation in recipient cells to support tumor
      growth and a prometastatic phenotype. Although it is clear that exosomes
      contribute to cancer cell plasticity, experimental evidence to define exosome
      induced plasticity as EMT is only just coming to light. This review will discuss 
      recent research on exosomal regulation of the EMT process in the tumor
      microenvironment.

TI  - Functions and Therapeutic Roles of Exosomes in Cancer.
LID - 127
AB  - The role of exosomes in cancer development has become the focus of much research,
      due to the many emerging roles possessed by exosomes. These micro-vesicles that
      are ubiquitously released in to the extracellular milieu, have been found to
      regulate immune system function, particularly in tumorigenesis, as well as
      conditioning future metastatic sites for the attachment and growth of tumor
      tissue. Through an interaction with a range of host tissue, exosomes are able to 
      generate a pro-tumor environment that is essential for carcinogenesis. Herein, we
      discuss the contents of exosomes and their contribution to tumorigenesis, as well
      as their role in chemotherapeutic resistance and the development of novel cancer 
      treatments and the identification of cancer biomarkers.

TI  - Current Concepts in Pediatric Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
LID - 54
AB  - The t(9;22)(q34;q11) or Philadelphia chromosome creates a BCR–ABL1 fusion gene
      encoding for a chimeric BCR–ABL1 protein. It is present in 3–4% of pediatric
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), and about 25% of adult ALL cases. Prior
      to the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), Ph+ ALL was associated with a 
      very poor prognosis despite the use of intensive chemotherapy and frequently
      hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission. The
      development of TKIs revolutionized the therapy of Ph+ ALL. Addition of the first 
      generation ABL1 class TKI imatinib to intensive chemotherapy dramatically
      increased the survival for children with Ph+ ALL and established that many
      patients can be cured without HSCT. In parallel, the mechanistic understanding of
      Ph+ ALL expanded exponentially through careful mapping of pathways downstream of 
      BCR–ABL1, the discovery of mutations in master regulators of B-cell development
      such as IKZF1 (Ikaros), PAX5, and early B-cell factor (EBF), the recognition of
      the complex clonal architecture of Ph+ ALL, and the delineation of genomic,
      epigenetic, and signaling abnormalities contributing to relapse and resistance.
      Still, many important basic and clinical questions remain unanswered. Current
      clinical trials are testing second generation TKIs in patients with newly
      diagnosed Ph+ ALL. Neither the optimal duration of therapy nor the optimal
      chemotherapy backbone are currently defined. The role of HSCT in first remission 
      and post-transplant TKI therapy also require further study. In addition, it will 
      be crucial to continue to dig deeper into understanding Ph+ ALL at a mechanistic 
      level, and translate findings into complementary targeted approaches. Expanding
      targeted therapies hold great promise to decrease toxicity and improve survival
      in this high-risk disease, which provides a paradigm for how targeted therapies
      can be incorporated into treatment of other high-risk leukemias.

TI  - The Genomic and Proteomic Content of Cancer Cell-Derived Exosomes.
LID - 38
AB  - Exosomes are secreted membrane vesicles that have been proposed as an effective
      means to detect a variety of disease states, including cancer. The properties of 
      exosomes, including stability in biological fluids, allow for their efficient
      isolation and make them an ideal vehicle for studies on early disease detection
      and evaluation. Much data has been collected over recent years regarding the
      messenger RNA, microRNA, and protein contents of exosomes. In addition, many
      studies have described the functional role that exosomes play in disease
      initiation and progression. Tumor cells have been shown to secrete exosomes,
      often in increased amounts compared to normal cells, and these exosomes can carry
      the genomic and proteomic signatures characteristic of the tumor cells from which
      they were derived. While these unique signatures make exosomes ideal for cancer
      detection, exosomes derived from cancer cells have also been shown to play a
      functional role in cancer progression. Here, we review the unique genomic and
      proteomic contents of exosomes originating from cancer cells as well as their
      functional effects to promote tumor progression.

TI  - Extracellular Vesicles – Biomarkers and Effectors of the Cellular Interactome in 
      Cancer.
LID - 21
AB  - In multicellular organisms both health and disease are defined by patterns of
      communication between the constituent cells. In addition to networks of soluble
      mediators, cells are also programed to exchange complex messages pre-assembled as
      multimolecular cargo of membraneous structures known extracellular vesicles (EV).
      Several biogenetic pathways produce EVs with different properties, and known as
      exosomes, ectosomes, and apoptotic bodies. In cancer, EVs carry molecular
      signatures and effectors of the disease, such as mutant oncoproteins, oncogenic
      transcripts, microRNA, and DNA sequences. Intercellular trafficking of such EVs
      (oncosomes) may contribute to horizontal cellular transformation, phenotypic
      reprograming, and functional re-education of recipient cells, both locally and
      systemically. The EV-mediated, reciprocal molecular exchange also includes tumor 
      suppressors, phosphoproteins, proteases, growth factors, and bioactive lipids,
      all of which participate in the functional integration of multiple cells and
      their collective involvement in tumor angiogenesis, inflammation, immunity,
      coagulopathy, mobilization of bone marrow-derived effectors, metastasis, drug
      resistance, or cellular stemness. In cases where the EV role is rate limiting
      their production and uptake may represent and unexplored anticancer therapy
      target. Moreover, oncosomes circulating in biofluids of cancer patients offer an 
      unprecedented, remote, and non-invasive access to crucial molecular information
      about cancer cells, including their driver mutations, classifiers, molecular
      subtypes, therapeutic targets, and biomarkers of drug resistance. New
      nanotechnologies are being developed to exploit this unique biomarker platform.
      Indeed, embracing the notion that human cancers are defined not only by processes
      occurring within cancer cells, but also between them, and amidst the altered
      tumor and systemic microenvironment may open new diagnostic and therapeutic
      opportunities.

TI  - Regulation of Sirtuin Function by Posttranslational Modifications.
LID - 29
AB  - Sirtuins are homologs of the yeast silencing information regulator 2 protein, an 
      NAD+-dependent (histone) deacetylase. In mammals seven different sirtuins,
      SIRT1–7, have been identified, which share a common catalytic core domain but
      possess distinct N- and C-terminal extensions. This core domain elicits
      NAD+-dependent deacetylase and in some cases also ADP-ribosyltransferase,
      demalonylase, and desuccinylase activities. Sirtuins have been implicated in key 
      cellular processes, including cell survival, autophagy, apoptosis, gene
      transcription, DNA repair, stress response, and genome stability. In addition
      some sirtuins are associated with disease, including cancer and
      neurodegeneration. These findings suggest strongly that sirtuins are tightly
      controlled and potentially responsive to different signal transduction pathways. 
      Here, we review the posttranslational regulation mechanisms of mammalian sirtuins
      and discuss their relevance regarding the physiological processes, with which the
      different sirtuins are associated. The available data suggest that the N- and
      C-terminal extensions are the targets of posttranslational modifications (PTM)
      that can affect the functions of sirtuins. Mechanistically this can be explained 
      by the interaction of these extensions with the catalytic core domain, which
      appears to be controlled by PTM at least in some cases. In contrast little is
      known about PTM and regulation of the catalytic domain itself. Together these
      findings point to key regulatory roles of the N- and C-terminal extensions in
      controlling sirtuin functions, thus connecting these regulators to different
      signaling pathways.

AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum; T. durum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) agricultural
      production is severely limited by various abiotic and biotic stress factors.
      Proteins are directly involved in plant stress response so it is important to
      study proteome changes under various stress conditions. Generally, both abiotic
      and biotic stress factors induce profound alterations in protein network covering
      signaling, energy metabolism (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, ATP biosynthesis,
      photosynthesis), storage proteins, protein metabolism, several other biosynthetic
      pathways (e.g., S-adenosylmethionine metabolism, lignin metabolism), transport
      proteins, proteins involved in protein folding and chaperone activities, other
      protective proteins (LEA, PR proteins), ROS scavenging enzymes as well as
      proteins affecting regulation of plant growth and development. Proteins which
      have been reported to reveal significant differences in their relative abundance 
      or posttranslational modifications between wheat, barley or related species
      genotypes under stress conditions are listed and their potential role in
      underlying the differential stress response is discussed. In conclusion,
      potential future roles of the results of proteomic studies in practical
      applications such as breeding for an enhanced stress tolerance and the
      possibilities to test and use protein markers in the breeding are suggested.

TI  - Clinical proteomics of myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 41
AB  - Myeloid leukemias are a heterogeneous group of diseases originating from bone
      marrow myeloid progenitor cells. Patients with myeloid leukemias can achieve
      long-term survival through targeted therapy, cure after intensive chemotherapy or
      short-term survival because of highly chemoresistant disease. Therefore, despite 
      the development of advanced molecular diagnostics, there is an unmet need for
      efficient therapy that reflects the advanced diagnostics. Although the molecular 
      design of therapeutic agents is aimed at interacting with specific proteins
      identified through molecular diagnostics, the majority of therapeutic agents act 
      on multiple protein targets. Ongoing studies on the leukemic cell proteome will
      probably identify a large number of new biomarkers, and the prediction of
      response to therapy through these markers is an interesting avenue for future
      personalized medicine. Mass spectrometric protein detection is a fundamental
      technique in clinical proteomics, and selected tools are presented, including
      stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), isobaric tags
      for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and multiple reaction monitoring
      (MRM), as well as single cell determination. We suggest that protein analysis
      will play not only a supplementary, but also a prominent role in future molecular
      diagnostics, and we outline how accurate knowledge of the molecular therapeutic
      targets can be used to monitor therapy response.

TI  - Angiotensin II Regulates microRNA-132/-212 in Hypertensive Rats and Humans.
PG  - 11190-207
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs that fine tune translation
      of multiple target mRNAs, are emerging as key regulators in cardiovascular
      development and disease. MiRNAs are involved in cardiac hypertrophy, heart
      failure and remodeling following cardiac infarction; however, miRNAs involved in 
      hypertension have not been thoroughly investigated. We have recently reported
      that specific miRNAs play an integral role in Angiotensin II receptor (AT1R)
      signaling, especially after activation of the Gαq signaling pathway. Since AT1R
      blockers are widely used to treat hypertension, we undertook a detailed analysis 
      of potential miRNAs involved in Angiotensin II (AngII) mediated hypertension in
      rats and hypertensive patients, using miRNA microarray and qPCR analysis. The
      miR-132 and miR-212 are highly increased in the heart, aortic wall and kidney of 
      rats with hypertension (159 ± 12 mm Hg) and cardiac hypertrophy following chronic
      AngII infusion. In addition, activation of the endothelin receptor, another Gαq
      coupled receptor, also increased miR-132 and miR-212. We sought to extend these
      observations using human samples by reasoning that AT1R blockers may decrease
      miR-132 and miR-212. We analyzed tissue samples of mammary artery obtained from
      surplus arterial tissue after coronary bypass operations. Indeed, we found a
      decrease in expression levels of miR-132 and miR-212 in human arteries from
      bypass-operated patients treated with AT1R blockers, whereas treatment with
      β-blockers had no effect. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-132 and
      miR-212 are involved in AngII induced hypertension, providing a new perspective
      in hypertensive disease mechanisms.

TI  - Mitogen-Activated Protein (MAP) Kinase Scaffolding Proteins: A Recount.
PG  - 4854-84
AB  - The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is the canonical signaling
      pathway for many receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor. Downstream of the receptors, this pathway involves the activation of a 
      kinase cascade that culminates in a transcriptional response and affects
      processes, such as cell migration and adhesion. In addition, the strength and
      duration of the upstream signal also influence the mode of the cellular response 
      that is switched on. Thus, the same components can in principle coordinate
      opposite responses, such as proliferation and differentiation. In recent years,
      it has become evident that MAPK signaling is regulated and fine-tuned by proteins
      that can bind to several MAPK signaling proteins simultaneously and, thereby,
      affect their function. These so-called MAPK scaffolding proteins are, thus,
      important coordinators of the signaling response in cells. In this review, we
      summarize the recent advances in the research on MAPK/extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway scaffolders. We will not only review the
      well-known members of the family, such as kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), but
      also put a special focus on the function of the recently identified or less
      studied scaffolders, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2,
      flotillin-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase organizer 1.

      Using PTMScan Direct.
PG  - 286-307
AB  - Traditional methods for analysis of peptides using liquid chromatography and
      tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) lack the specificity to comprehensively
      monitor specific biological processes due to the inherent duty cycle limitations 
      of the MS instrument and the stochastic nature of the analytical platform.
      PTMScan Direct is a novel, antibody-based method that allows quantitative
      LC-MS/MS profiling of specific peptides from proteins that reside in the same
      signaling pathway. New PTMScan Direct reagents have been produced that target
      peptides from proteins involved in DNA Damage/Cell Cycle and Apoptosis/Autophagy 
      pathways. Together, the reagents provide access to 438 sites on 237 proteins in
      these signaling cascades. These reagents have been used to profile the response
      to UV damage of DNA in human cell lines. UV damage was shown to activate
      canonical DNA damage response pathways through ATM/ATR-dependent signaling,
      stress response pathways and induce the initiation of apoptosis, as assessed by
      an increase in the abundance of peptides corresponding to cleaved, activated
      caspases. These data demonstrate the utility of PTMScan Direct as a multiplexed
      assay for profiling specific cellular responses to various stimuli, such as UV
      damage of DNA.

TI  - The Proteomics Big Challenge for Biomarkers and New Drug-Targets Discovery.
PG  - 13926-48
AB  - In the modern process of drug discovery, clinical, functional and chemical
      proteomics can converge and integrate synergies. Functional proteomics explores
      and elucidates the components of pathways and their interactions which, when
      deregulated, lead to a disease condition. This knowledge allows the design of
      strategies to target multiple pathways with combinations of pathway-specific
      drugs, which might increase chances of success and reduce the occurrence of drug 
      resistance. Chemical proteomics, by analyzing the drug interactome, strongly
      contributes to accelerate the process of new druggable targets discovery. In the 
      research area of clinical proteomics, proteome and peptidome mass
      spectrometry-profiling of human bodily fluid (plasma, serum, urine and so on), as
      well as of tissue and of cells, represents a promising tool for novel biomarker
      and eventually new druggable targets discovery. In the present review we provide 
      a survey of current strategies of functional, chemical and clinical proteomics.
      Major issues will be presented for proteomic technologies used for the discovery 
      of biomarkers for early disease diagnosis and identification of new drug targets.

PG  - 12287-314
AB  - Massive evidence suggests that genetic abnormalities contribute to the
      development of lung cancer. These molecular abnormalities may serve as
      diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers for this deadly disease. It is
      imperative to search these biomarkers in different tumorigenesis pathways so as
      to provide the most appropriate therapy for each individual patient with lung
      malignancy. Phosphoproteomics is a promising technology for the identification of
      biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for cancer. Thousands of proteins
      interact via physical and chemical association. Moreover, some proteins can
      covalently modify other proteins post-translationally. These post-translational
      modifications ultimately give rise to the emergent functions of cells in
      sequence, space and time. Phosphoproteomics clinical researches imply the
      comprehensive analysis of the proteins that are expressed in cells or tissues and
      can be employed at different stages. In addition, understanding the functions of 
      phosphorylated proteins requires the study of proteomes as linked systems rather 
      than collections of individual protein molecules. In fact, proteomics approaches 
      coupled with affinity chromatography strategies followed by mass spectrometry
      have been used to elucidate relevant biological questions. This article will
      discuss the relevant clues of post-translational modifications, phosphorylated
      proteins, and useful proteomics approaches to identify molecular cancer

TI  - Human Gene Control by Vital Oncogenes: Revisiting a Theoretical Model and Its
      Implications for Targeted Cancer Therapy.
PG  - 316-35
AB  - An important assumption of our current understanding of the mechanisms of
      carcinogenesis has been the belief that clarification of the cancer process would
      inevitably reveal some of the crucial mechanisms of normal human gene regulation.
      Since the momentous work of Bishop and Varmus, both the molecular and the
      biochemical processes underlying the events in the development of cancer have
      become increasingly clear. The identification of cellular signaling pathways and 
      the role of protein kinases in the events leading to gene activation have been
      critical to our understanding not only of normal cellular gene control
      mechanisms, but also have clarified some of the important molecular and
      biochemical events occurring within a cancer cell. We now know that oncogenes are
      dysfunctional proto-oncogenes and that dysfunctional tumor suppressor genes
      contribute to the cancer process. Furthermore, Weinstein and others have
      hypothesized the phenomenon of oncogene addiction as a distinct characteristic of
      the malignant cell. It can be assumed that cancer cells, indeed, become dependent
      on such vital oncogenes. The products of these vital oncogenes, such as c-myc,
      may well be the Achilles heel by which targeted molecular therapy may lead to
      truly personalized cancer therapy. The remaining problem is the need to introduce
      relevant molecular diagnostic tests such as genome microarray analysis and
      proteomic methods, especially protein kinase identification arrays, for each
      individual patient. Genome wide association studies on cancers with gene analysis
      of single nucleotide and other mutations in functional proto-oncogenes will,
      hopefully, identify dysfunctional proto-oncogenes and allow the development of
      more specific targeted drugs directed against the protein products of these vital
      oncogenes. In 1984 Willis proposed a molecular and biochemical model for
      eukaryotic gene regulation suggesting how proto-oncogenes might function within
      the normal cell. That model predicted the existence of vital oncogenes and can
      now be used to hypothesize the biochemical and molecular mechanisms that drive
      the processes leading to disruption of the gene regulatory machinery, resulting
      in the transformation of normal cells into cancer.

TI  - Yeast Two-Hybrid, a Powerful Tool for Systems Biology.
PG  - 2763-88
AB  - A key property of complex biological systems is the presence of interaction
      networks formed by its different components, primarily proteins. These are
      crucial for all levels of cellular function, including architecture, metabolism
      and signalling, as well as the availability of cellular energy. Very stable, but 
      also rather transient and dynamic protein-protein interactions generate new
      system properties at the level of multiprotein complexes, cellular compartments
      or the entire cell. Thus, interactomics is expected to largely contribute to
      emerging fields like systems biology or systems bioenergetics. The more recent
      technological development of high-throughput methods for interactomics research
      will dramatically increase our knowledge of protein interaction networks. The two
      most frequently used methods are yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening, a well
      established genetic in vivo approach, and affinity purification of complexes
      followed by mass spectrometry analysis, an emerging biochemical in vitro
      technique. So far, a majority of published interactions have been detected using 
      an Y2H screen. However, with the massive application of this method, also some
      limitations have become apparent. This review provides an overview on available
      yeast two-hybrid methods, in particular focusing on more recent approaches. These
      allow detection of protein interactions in their native environment, as e.g. in
      the cytosol or bound to a membrane, by using cytosolic signalling cascades or
      split protein constructs. Strengths and weaknesses of these genetic methods are
      discussed and some guidelines for verification of detected protein-protein
      interactions are provided.

TI  - Analyses of the combination of 6-MP and dasatinib in cell culture.
PG  - 13-22
AB  - A major tenet of cancer therapeutics is that combinations of anticancer agents
      with different mechanisms of action and different toxicities may be effective
      treatment regimens. Evaluation of additivity/synergy in cell culture may be used 
      to identify drug combination opportunities and to assess risk of
      additive/synergistic toxicity. The combination of 6-mercaptopurine and dasatinib 
      was assessed for additivity/synergy using the combination index (CI) method and a
      response surface method in six human tumor cell lines including MCF-7 and
      MDA-MB-468 breast cancer, NCI-H23 and NCI-H460 non-small cell lung cancer, and
      A498 and 786-O renal cell cancer, based on two experimental end-points: ATP
      content and colony formation. Clonal colony formation by human bone marrow CFU-GM
      was used to assess risk of enhanced toxicity. The concentration ranges tested for
      each drug were selected to encompass the clinical Cmax concentrations. The
      combination regimens were found to be additive to sub-additive by both methods of
      data analysis, but synergy was not detected. The non-small cell lung cancer cell 
      lines were the most responsive among the tumor lines tested and the renal cell
      carcinoma lines were the least responsive. The bone marrows CFU-GM were more
      sensitive to the combination regimens than were the tumor cell lines. Based upon 
      these data, it appears that the possibility of enhanced efficacy from combining
      6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and dasatinib would be associated with increased risk of 
      severe bone marrow toxicity, so the combination is unlikely to provide a
      therapeutic advantage for treating solid tumor patients where adequate bone
      marrow function must be preserved.

TI  - Mitochondrial Acetylation and Diseases of Aging.
LID - 234875
AB  - In recent years, protein lysine acetylation has emerged as a prominent and
      conserved regulatory posttranslational modification that is abundant on numerous 
      enzymes involved in the processes of intermediary metabolism. Well-characterized 
      mitochondrial processes of carbon utilization are enriched in acetyl-lysine
      modifications. Although seminal discoveries have been made in the basic biology
      of mitochondrial acetylation, an understanding of how acetylation states
      influence enzyme function and metabolic reprogramming during pathological states 
      remains largely unknown. This paper will examine our current understanding of
      eukaryotic acetate metabolism and present recent findings in the field of
      mitochondrial acetylation biology. The implications of mitochondrial acetylation 
      for the aging process will be discussed, as well as its potential implications
      for the unique and localized metabolic states that occur during the
      aging-associated conditions of heart failure and cancer growth.

TI  - Implications of tyrosine phosphoproteomics in cervical carcinogenesis.
PG  - 2
AB  - Background: Worldwide cervical cancer remains a leading cause of mortality from
      gynecologic malignancies. The link between cervical cancer and persistent
      infection with HPV has been established. At a molecular level little is known
      about the transition from the precancerous state to invasive cancer. To elucidate
      this process, cervical biopsies from human specimens were obtained from
      precancerous state to stage III disease. Methods: Cervical biopsies were obtained
      from patients with a diagnosis of cervical cancer undergoing definitive surgery
      or staging operation. Biopsies were obtained from patients with precancerous
      lesions at the time of their excisional procedure. Control samples were obtained 
      from patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions such as fibroids.
      Samples were subjected to proteomic profiling using two dimensional gel
      electrophoresis with subsequent trypsin digestion followed by MALDI-TOF protein
      identification. Candidate proteins were then further studied using western
      blotting, immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry. Results: Annexin A1 and
      DNA-PKcs were found to be differentially expressed. Phosphorylated annexin A1 was
      up regulated in diseased states in comparison to control and its level was
      strongly detected in the serum of cervical cancer patients compared to controls. 
      DNA-PKcs was noted to be hyperphosphorylated and fragmented in cancer when
      compared to controls. By immunohistochemistry annexin A1 was noted in the
      vascular environment in cancer and certain precancerous samples. Conclusion: This
      study suggests a probable role for protein tyrosine phosphorylation in cervical
      carcinogenesis. Annexin A1 and DNA-PK cs may have synergistic effects with HPV
      infection. Precancerous lesions that may progress to cervical cancer may be
      differentiated from lesions that will not base on similar immunohistochemical
      profile to invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

TI  - Biological properties of extracellular vesicles and their physiological
      functions.
LID - 10.3402/jev.v4.27066
AB  - In the past decade, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recognized as potent
      vehicles of intercellular communication, both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This
      is due to their capacity to transfer proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, thereby 
      influencing various physiological and pathological functions of both recipient
      and parent cells. While intensive investigation has targeted the role of EVs in
      different pathological processes, for example, in cancer and autoimmune diseases,
      the EV-mediated maintenance of homeostasis and the regulation of physiological
      functions have remained less explored. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview 
      of the current understanding of the physiological roles of EVs, which has been
      written by crowd-sourcing, drawing on the unique EV expertise of academia-based
      scientists, clinicians and industry based in 27 European countries, the United
      States and Australia. This review is intended to be of relevance to both
      researchers already working on EV biology and to newcomers who will encounter
      this universal cell biological system. Therefore, here we address the molecular
      contents and functions of EVs in various tissues and body fluids from cell
      systems to organs. We also review the physiological mechanisms of EVs in
      bacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants to highlight the functional uniformity of
      this emerging communication system.

TI  - Nanotopographical Control of Stem Cell Differentiation.
LID - 120623
AB  - Stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into various lineages, and the
      ability to reliably direct stem cell fate determination would have tremendous
      potential for basic research and clinical therapy. Nanotopography provides a
      useful tool for guiding differentiation, as the features are more durable than
      surface chemistry and can be modified in size and shape to suit the desired
      application. In this paper, nanotopography is examined as a means to guide
      differentiation, and its application is described in the context of different
      subsets of stem cells, with a particular focus on skeletal (mesenchymal) stem
      cells. To address the mechanistic basis underlying the topographical effects on
      stem cells, the likely contributions of indirect (biochemical signal-mediated)
      and direct (force-mediated) mechanotransduction are discussed. Data from
      proteomic research is also outlined in relation to topography-mediated fate
      determination, as this approach provides insight into the global molecular
      changes at the level of the functional effectors.

TI  - Identification and proteomic profiling of exosomes in human cerebrospinal fluid.
PG  - 5
AB  - Background: Exosomes are released from multiple cell types, contain protein and
      RNA species, and have been exploited as a novel reservoir for disease biomarker
      discovery. They can transfer information between cells and may cause pathology,
      for example, a role for exosomes has been proposed in the pathophysiology of
      Alzheimer's disease. Although studied in several biofluids, exosomes have not
      been extensively studied in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from humans. The
      objective of this study was to determine: 1) whether human CSF contains exosomes 
      and 2) the variability in exosomal protein content across individuals. Methods:
      CSF was collected from 5 study participants undergoing thoraco-abdominal aortic
      aneurysm repair (around 200 - 500 ml per participant) and low-density membrane
      vesicles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The presence of exosomes was
      determined by western blot for marker proteins, isopycnic centrifugation on a
      sucrose step gradient and transmission electron microscopy with immuno-labelling.
      Whole protein profiling was performed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron
      resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR). Results: Flotillin 1 and tumor
      susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), two exosomal marker proteins, were identified
      in the ultracentrifugation pellet using western blot. These markers localized to 
      a density consistent with exosomes following isopycnic centrifugation.
      Transmission electron microscopy visualized structures consistent with exosomes
      in size and appearance that labelled positive for flotillin 1. Therefore, the
      pellet that resulted from ultracentrifugation of human CSF contained exosomes.
      FT-ICR profiling of this pellet was performed and 84-161 ions were detected per
      study participant. Around one third of these ions were only present in a single
      study participant and one third were detected in all five. With regard to ion
      quantity, the median coefficient of variation was 81% for ions detected in two or
      more samples. Conclusions: Exosomes were identified in human CSF and their
      proteome is a potential new reservoir for biomarker discovery in neurological
      disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, techniques used to concentrate
      exosomes from CSF need refinement to reduce variability. In this study we used
      relatively large starting volumes of human CSF, future studies will focus on
      exosome isolation from smaller 'real life' clinical samples; a key challenge in
      the development of exosomes as translational tools.

TI  - Role of SIRT3 in the regulation of redox balance during oral carcinogenesis.
PG  - 68
AB  - Background: Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are a family of NAD-dependent deacetylases, which 
      play an important role in regulating cancer tumorigenesis; however, their role in
      oral cancer has been controversial. SIRT3 is localized in the mitochondria, where
      it deacetylates and activates several enzymes involved in cellular redox balance 
      and defense against oxidative damage. Results: We found that compared with normal
      human oral keratinocytes (HOK), SIRT3 is highly expressed in oral squamous cell
      carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines, but the enzymatic deacetylation is significantly
      reduced. We also sequenced the entire coding region of SIRT3 and found the same
      mutation in 2 different OSCC cell lines. This point mutation is located in close 
      proximity to the active site of deacetylase in the SIRT3 protein, and reduces the
      overall enzymatic efficiency of deacetylation. Furthermore, up-regulation of
      SIRT3 inhibited the cell growth of OSCCs and decreased the levels of basal
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both OSCC lines. To verify that the SIRT3
      sequence variation was associated with oral carcinogenesis, we sequenced the
      SIRT3 gene from 21 OSCC patients, and 5 of the 21 patients (23.8%) carried the
      heterozygous missense mutation, p.Val208Ile. The heterozygous missense mutation
      in these patients was present in gremlin DNA isolated from both normal and tumor 
      tissues. Conclusions: Our findings provide a valuable insight into the potential 
      role of SIRT3 in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma, by showing that
      a non-synonymous point mutation in SIRT3 contributes to reduced catalytic
      activity of the protein and affects redox balance in OSCCs.

TI  - Dasatinib reduces FAK phosphorylation increasing the effects of RPI-1 inhibition 
      in a RET/PTC1-expressing cell line.
PG  - 278
AB  - Background: TPC-1 is a papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)-derived cell line that
      spontaneously expresses the oncogene RET/PTC1. TPC-1 treated with the RET/PTC1
      inhibitor RPI-1 displayed a cytostatic and reversible inhibition of cell
      proliferation and a strong activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). As
      dasatinib inhibition of Src results in reduction of FAK activation, we evaluated 
      the effects of TPC-1 treatment with dasatinib in combination with RPI-1. Results:
      Dasatinib (100 nM) strongly reduced TPC-1 proliferation and induced marked
      changes in TPC-1 morphology. Cells appeared smaller and more contracted, with
      decreased cell spreading, due to the inhibition of phosphorylation of important
      cytoskeletal proteins (p130CAS, Crk, and paxillin) by dasatinib. The combination 
      of RPI-1 with dasatinib demonstrated enhanced effects on cell proliferation (more
      than 80% reduction) and on the phosphotyrosine protein profile. In particular,
      RPI-1 reduced the phosphorylation of RET, MET, DCDB2, CTND1, and PLCγ, while
      dasatinib acted on the phosphorylation of EGFR, EPHA2, and DOK1. Moreover,
      dasatinib completely abrogated the phosphorylation of FAK at all tyrosine sites
      (Y576, Y577, Y861, Y925) with the exception of the autoactivation site (Y397).
      Notably, the pharmacological treatments induced an overexpression of integrin β1 
      (ITB1) that was correlated with a mild enhancement in phosphorylation of ERK1/2
      and STAT3, known for their roles in prevention of apoptosis and in increase of
      proliferation and survival. A reduction in Akt, p38 and JNK1/2 activation was
      observed. Conclusions: All data demonstrate that the combination of the two drugs
      effectively reduced cell proliferation (by more than 80%), significantly
      decreased Tyr phosphorylation of almost all phosphorylable proteins, and altered 
      the morphology of the cells, supporting high cytostatic effects. Following the
      combined treatment, cell survival pathways appeared to be mediated by STAT3 and
      ERK activities resulting from integrin clustering and FAK autophosphorylation.
      EphA2 may also contribute, at least in part, to integrin and FAK activation. In
      conclusion, these data implicate ITB1 and EphA2 as promising therapeutic targets 
      in PTC.

TI  - Differential genetic interactions of yeast stress response MAPK pathways.
LID - 800
AB  - Genetic interaction screens have been applied with great success in several
      organisms to study gene function and the genetic architecture of the cell.
      However, most studies have been performed under optimal growth conditions even
      though many functional interactions are known to occur under specific cellular
      conditions. In this study, we have performed a large-scale genetic interaction
      analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae involving approximately 49 × 1,200 double
      mutants in the presence of five different stress conditions, including osmotic,
      oxidative and cell wall-altering stresses. This resulted in the generation of a
      differential E-MAP (or dE-MAP) comprising over 250,000 measurements of
      conditional interactions. We found an extensive number of conditional genetic
      interactions that recapitulate known stress-specific functional associations.
      Furthermore, we have also uncovered previously unrecognized roles involving the
      phosphatase regulator Bud14, the histone methylation complex COMPASS and membrane
      trafficking complexes in modulating the cell wall integrity pathway. Finally, the
      osmotic stress differential genetic interactions showed enrichment for genes
      coding for proteins with conditional changes in phosphorylation but not for genes
      with conditional changes in gene expression. This suggests that conditional
      genetic interactions are a powerful tool to dissect the functional importance of 
      the different response mechanisms of the cell.

      approach clinically feasible. Characterized by a highly heterogeneous mutational 
      landscape with few common features, many TNBCs cluster together based on their
      ‘basal-like’ transcriptional profiles. We therefore hypothesized that targeting
      TNBC cells on a systems level by exploiting the transcriptional cell state might 
      be a viable strategy to find novel therapies for this highly aggressive disease. 
      We performed a large-scale chemical genetic screen and identified a group of
      compounds related to the drug PKC412 (midostaurin). PKC412 induced apoptosis in a
      subset of TNBC cells enriched for the basal-like subtype and inhibited tumor
      growth in vivo. We employed a multi-omics approach and computational modeling to 
      address the mechanism of action and identified spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) as a 
      novel and unexpected target in TNBC. Quantitative phosphoproteomics revealed that
      SYK inhibition abrogates signaling to STAT3, explaining the selectivity for
      basal-like breast cancer cells. This non-oncogene addiction suggests that
      chemical SYK inhibition may be beneficial for a specific subset of TNBC patients 
      and demonstrates that targeting cell states could be a viable strategy to
      discover novel treatment strategies.

TI  - Harmonic oscillator model of the insulin and IGF1 receptors' allosteric binding
      and activation.
PG  - 243
AB  - The insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors activate overlapping
      signalling pathways that are critical for growth, metabolism, survival and
      longevity. Their mechanism of ligand binding and activation displays complex
      allosteric properties, which no mathematical model has been able to account for. 
      Modelling these receptors' binding and activation in terms of interactions
      between the molecular components is problematical due to many unknown biochemical
      and structural details. Moreover, substantial combinatorial complexity
      originating from multivalent ligand binding further complicates the problem. On
      the basis of the available structural and biochemical information, we develop a
      physically plausible model of the receptor binding and activation, which is based
      on the concept of a harmonic oscillator. Modelling a network of interactions
      among all possible receptor intermediaries arising in the context of the model
      (35, for the insulin receptor) accurately reproduces for the first time all the
      kinetic properties of the receptor, and provides unique and robust estimates of
      the kinetic parameters. The harmonic oscillator model may be adaptable for many
      other dimeric/dimerizing receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors and
      G-protein-coupled receptors where ligand crosslinking occurs.

TI  - Phosphoproteomics characterization of novel phosphorylated sites of lens proteins
      from normal and cataractous human eye lenses.
PG  - 186-98
AB  - Purpose: Post-translational modification (PTM) of lens proteins is believed to
      play various roles in age-related lens function and development. Among the
      different types of PTM, phosphorylation is most noteworthy to play a major role
      in the regulation of various biosignaling pathways in relation to metabolic
      processes and cellular functions. The present study reported the quantitative
      analysis of the in vivo phosphoproteomics profiles of human normal and
      cataractous lenses with the aim of identifying specific phosphorylation sites
      which may provide insights into the physiologic significance of phosphorylation
      in relation to cataract formation. Methods: To improve detection sensitivity of
      low abundant proteins, we first adopted SDS-gel electrophoresis fractionation of 
      lens extracts to identify and compare the protein compositions between normal and
      cataractous lenses, followed by tryptic digestion, enrichment of phosphopeptides 
      by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and nano-liquid
      chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis. Results:
      By comprehensively screening of the phosphoproteome in normal and cataractous
      lenses, we identified 32 phosphoproteins and 73 phosphorylated sites. The most
      abundantly phosphorylated proteins are two subunits of β-crystallin, i.e.,
      βB1-crystallin (12%) and βB2-crystallin (12%). Moreover, serine was found to be
      the most abundantly phosphorylated residue (72%) in comparison with threonine
      (24%) and tyrosine (4%) in the lens phosphoproteome. The quantitative analysis
      revealed significant and distinct changes of 19 phosphoproteins corresponding to 
      28 phosphorylated sites between these two types of human lenses, including 20
      newly discovered novel phosphorylation sites on lens proteins. Conclusions: The
      shotgun phosphoproteomics approach to characterize protein phosphorylation may be
      adapted and extended to the comprehensive analysis of other types of
      post-translational modification of lens proteins in vivo. The identification of
      these novel phosphorylation sites in lens proteins that showed differential
      expression in the cataractous lens may bear some unknown physiologic significance
      and provide insights into phosphorylation-related human eye diseases, which

PG  - 818-26
AB  - Most cancers are characterized by multiple molecular alterations, but
      identification of the key proteins involved in these signaling pathways is
      currently beyond reach. We show that the inhibitor PU-H71 preferentially targets 
      tumor-enriched Hsp90 complexes and affinity captures Hsp90-dependent oncogenic
      client proteins. We have used PU-H71 affinity capture to design a proteomic
      approach that, when combined with bioinformatic pathway analysis, identifies
      dysregulated signaling networks and key oncoproteins in chronic myeloid leukemia.
      The identified interactome overlaps with the well-characterized altered proteome 
      in this cancer, indicating that this method can provide global insights into the 
      biology of individual tumors, including primary patient specimens. In addition,
      we show that this approach can be used to identify previously uncharacterized
      oncoproteins and mechanisms, potentially leading to new targeted therapies. We
      further show that the abundance of the PU-H71-enriched Hsp90 species, which is
      not dictated by Hsp90 expression alone, is predictive of the cell’s sensitivity
      to Hsp90 inhibition.

      signalling.
LID - 6265
AB  - Cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion is a fundamental requirement for
      multicellular existence due to roles in positioning, proliferation and
      differentiation. Phosphorylation plays a major role in adhesion signalling;
      however, a full understanding of the phosphorylation events that occur at sites
      of adhesion is lacking. Here we report a proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis 
      of adhesion complexes isolated from cells spread on fibronectin. We identify
      1,174 proteins, 499 of which are phosphorylated (1,109 phosphorylation sites),
      including both well-characterized and novel adhesion-regulated phosphorylation
      events. Immunoblotting suggests that two classes of phosphorylated residues are
      found at adhesion sites—those induced by adhesion and those constitutively
      phosphorylated but recruited in response to adhesion. Kinase prediction analysis 
      identifies novel kinases with putative roles in adhesion signalling including
      CDK1, inhibition of which reduces adhesion complex formation. This
      phospho-adhesome data set constitutes a valuable resource to improve our
      understanding of the signalling mechanisms through which cell–ECM interactions
      control cell behaviour.

TI  - Activation of diverse signaling pathways by oncogenic PIK3CA mutations.
PG  - 4961
AB  - The PIK3CA gene is frequently mutated in human cancers. Here we carry out a
      SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis using isogenic knockin cell
      lines containing ‘driver’ oncogenic mutations of PIK3CA to dissect the signaling 
      mechanisms responsible for oncogenic phenotypes induced by mutant PIK3CA. From
      8,075 unique phosphopeptides identified, we observe that aberrant activation of
      PI3K pathway leads to increased phosphorylation of a surprisingly wide variety of
      kinases and downstream signaling networks. Here, by integrating phosphoproteomic 
      data with human protein microarray-based AKT1 kinase assays, we discover and
      validate six novel AKT1 substrates, including cortactin. Through mutagenesis
      studies, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of cortactin by AKT1 is important
      for mutant PI3K enhanced cell migration and invasion. Our study describes a
      quantitative and global approach for identifying mutation-specific signaling
      events and for discovering novel signaling molecules as readouts of pathway
      activation or potential therapeutic targets.

TI  - The nuclear envelope environment and its cancer connections.
PG  - 196-209
AB  - Because of the association between aberrant nuclear structure and tumour grade,
      nuclear morphology is an indispensible criterion in the current pathological
      assessment of cancer. Components of the nuclear envelope environment have central
      roles in many aspects of cell function that affect tumour development and
      progression. As the roles of the nuclear envelope components, including nuclear
      pore complexes and nuclear lamina, are being deciphered in molecular detail there
      are opportunities to harness this knowledge for cancer therapeutics and biomarker
      development. In this Review, we summarize the progress that has been made in our 
      understanding of the nuclear envelope and the implications of changes in this
      environment for cancer biology.

TI  - NuRD: A multi-faceted chromatin remodeling complex in regulating cancer biology.
PG  - 588-96
AB  - The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD; also known as Mi-2) complex
      regulates gene expression at the level of chromatin. The NuRD complex has been
      identified – using both genetic and molecular analyses – as a key determinant of 
      differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells and during development in various
      model systems. Similar to other chromatin remodelers, such as SWI/SNF and
      polycomb complexes, NuRD has also been implicated in the regulation of
      transcriptional events integral to oncogenesis and cancer progression. Emerging
      molecular details regarding recruitment of NuRD to specific loci during
      development and modulation of these events in cancer are used to illustrate how
      inappropriate localization of the complex could contribute to tumor biology.

TI  - The role of AXL and the in vitro activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor BGB324 in Ewing sarcoma.
PG  - 12753-68
AB  - New targets for Ewing sarcoma (ES) patients are urgently needed. Therefore, we
      investigated the expression and genetic aberrations of the oncogenic receptor
      tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL in ES and determined the efficacy of AXL targeting on
      cell viability and migration. First, AXL and Gas6 (ligand) mRNA expression was
      determined by RT-PCR on 29 ES samples. Low, medium and high AXL mRNA expression
      was observed in 31% (n = 9), 48% (n = 14) and 21% (n = 6) of samples. Gas6 was
      abundantly present in all specimens. We next tested AXL protein expression
      immunohistochemically in 36 tumors (primary, post-chemotherapy, metastasized and 
      relapsed samples) from 25 ES patients. Low, medium and high AXL protein
      expression was observed in 17% (n = 6), 19% (n = 7) and 36% (n = 13) of samples. 
      In primary tumors (n = 15), high AXL expression correlated significantly with a
      worse overall survival compared to patients with lower expression (61 vs. 194
      months, p = 0.026). No genetic aberrations were detected in the AXL RTK domain (n
      = 29). The AXL-inhibitor BGB324 affected viability (IC50 0.79–2.13 μmol/L) and
      migratory potential of all tested ES cell lines in vitro (n = 5–6). BGB324
      chemosensitized chemotherapy-resistant ES-4 cells to vincristine and doxorubicin.
      These data suggest that AXL is a potential novel, druggable therapeutic target in
      ES.

AB  - The control of cellular growth and proliferation is key to the maintenance of
      homeostasis. Survival, proliferation, and arrest are regulated, in part, by
      Growth Arrest Specific 6 (Gas6) through binding to members of the TAM receptor
      tyrosine kinase family. Activation of the TAM receptors leads to downstream
      signaling through common kinases, but the exact mechanism within each cellular
      context varies and remains to be completely elucidated. Deregulation of the TAM
      family, due to its central role in mediating cellular proliferation, has been
      implicated in multiple diseases. Axl was cloned as the first TAM receptor in a
      search for genes involved in the progression of chronic to acute-phase leukemia, 
      and has since been established as playing a critical role in the progression of
      cancer. The oncogenic nature of Axl is demonstrated through its activation of
      signaling pathways involved in proliferation, migration, inhibition of apoptosis,
      and therapeutic resistance. Despite its recent discovery, significant progress
      has been made in the development of effective clinical therapeutics targeting
      Axl. In order to accurately define the role of Axl in normal and diseased
      processes, it must be analyzed in a cell type-specific context.

PG  - 9546-63
AB  - The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase and its major ligand, GAS6 have been
      demonstrated to be overexpressed and activated in many human cancers (such as
      lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer) and have been correlated with poor
      prognosis, promotion of increased invasiveness/metastasis, the EMT phenotype and 
      drug resistance. Targeting AXL in different model systems with specific small
      molecule kinase inhibitors or antibodies alone or in combination with other drugs
      can lead to inactivation of AXL-mediated signaling pathways and can lead to
      regained drug sensitivity and improved therapeutic efficacy, defining AXL as a
      promising novel target for cancer therapeutics. This review highlights the data
      supporting AXL as a novel treatment candidate in a variety of cancers as well as 
      the current status of drug development targeting the AXL/GAS6 axis and future
      perspectives in this emerging field.

TI  - Mutational analysis of genes coding for cell surface proteins in colorectal
      cancer cell lines reveal novel altered pathways, druggable mutations and mutated 
      epitopes for targeted therapy.
PG  - 9199-213
AB  - We carried out a mutational analysis of 3,594 genes coding for cell surface
      proteins (Surfaceome) in 23 colorectal cancer cell lines, searching for new
      altered pathways, druggable mutations and mutated epitopes for targeted therapy
      in colorectal cancer. A total of 3,944 somatic non-synonymous substitutions and
      595 InDels, occurring in 2,061 (57%) Surfaceome genes were catalogued. We
      identified 48 genes not previously described as mutated in colorectal tumors in
      the TCGA database, including genes that are mutated and expressed in >10% of the 
      cell lines (SEMA4C, FGFRL1, PKD1, FAM38A, WDR81, TMEM136, SLC36A1, SLC26A6,
      IGFLR1). Analysis of these genes uncovered important roles for FGF and SEMA4
      signaling in colorectal cancer with possible therapeutic implications. We also
      found that cell lines express on average 11 druggable mutations, including
      frequent mutations (>20%) in the receptor tyrosine kinases AXL and EPHA2, which
      have not been previously considered as potential targets for colorectal cancer.
      Finally, we identified 82 cell surface mutated epitopes, however expression of
      only 30% of these epitopes was detected in our cell lines. Notwithstanding, 92%
      of these epitopes were expressed in cell lines with the mutator phenotype,
      opening new venues for the use of “general” immune checkpoint drugs in this
      subset of patients.

TI  - Mechanisms of AXL overexpression and function in Imatinib-resistant chronic
      myeloid leukemia cells.
PG  - 874-85
AB  - AXL is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the TAM family, the function of which is
      poorly understood. We previously identified AXL overexpression in Imatinib
      (IM)-resistant CML cell lines and patients. The present study was conducted to
      investigate the role of AXL and the mechanisms underlying AXL overexpression in
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI)-resistant CML cells. We present evidence that
      high AXL expression level is a feature of TKI-resistant CML cells and knockdown
      of AXL sensitized TKI-resistant cells to IM. In addition, expression of wild-type
      AXL but not a dominant negative form of AXL confers IM-sensitive CML cells the
      capacity to resist IM effect. AXL overexpression required PKCα and β and
      constitutive activation of ERK1/2. Accordingly, GF109203X a PKC inhibitor, U0126 
      a MEK1 inhibitor and PKCα/β knockdown restore sensitivity to IM while PKCα or
      PKCβ overexpression in CML cells promotes protection against IM-induced cell
      death. Finally, using luciferase promoter activity assays we established that AXL
      is regulated transcriptionally through the AP1 transcription factor. Our findings
      reveal an unexpected role of AXL in resistance to TKI in CML cells, identify the 
      molecular mechanisms involved in its overexpression and support the notion that
      AXL is a new marker of resistance to TKI in CML.

TI  - Neuroblastoma Tyrosine Kinase Signaling Networks Involve FYN and LYN in Endosomes
      and Lipid Rafts.
LID - e1004130
AB  - Protein phosphorylation plays a central role in creating a highly dynamic network
      of interacting proteins that reads and responds to signals from growth factors in
      the cellular microenvironment. Cells of the neural crest employ multiple
      signaling mechanisms to control migration and differentiation during development.
      It is known that defects in these mechanisms cause neuroblastoma, but how
      multiple signaling pathways interact to govern cell behavior is unknown. In a
      phosphoproteomic study of neuroblastoma cell lines and cell fractions, including 
      endosomes and detergent-resistant membranes, 1622 phosphorylated proteins were
      detected, including more than half of the receptor tyrosine kinases in the human 
      genome. Data were analyzed using a combination of graph theory and pattern
      recognition techniques that resolve data structure into networks that incorporate
      statistical relationships and protein-protein interaction data. Clusters of
      proteins in these networks are indicative of functional signaling pathways. The
      analysis indicates that receptor tyrosine kinases are functionally
      compartmentalized into distinct collaborative groups distinguished by activation 
      and intracellular localization of SRC-family kinases, especially FYN and LYN.
      Changes in intracellular localization of activated FYN and LYN were observed in
      response to stimulation of the receptor tyrosine kinases, ALK and KIT. The
      results suggest a mechanism to distinguish signaling responses to activation of
      different receptors, or combinations of receptors, that govern the behavior of
      the neural crest, which gives rise to neuroblastoma.

TI  - Data-Derived Modeling Characterizes Plasticity of MAPK Signaling in Melanoma.
LID - e1003795
AB  - The majority of melanomas have been shown to harbor somatic mutations in the
      RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, which play a major role in regulation of 
      proliferation and survival. The prevalence of these mutations makes these kinase 
      signal transduction pathways an attractive target for cancer therapy. However,
      tumors have generally shown adaptive resistance to treatment. This adaptation is 
      achieved in melanoma through its ability to undergo neovascularization, migration
      and rearrangement of signaling pathways. To understand the dynamic, nonlinear
      behavior of signaling pathways in cancer, several computational modeling
      approaches have been suggested. Most of those models require that the pathway
      topology remains constant over the entire observation period. However, changes in
      topology might underlie adaptive behavior to drug treatment. To study signaling
      rearrangements, here we present a new approach based on Fuzzy Logic (FL) that
      predicts changes in network architecture over time. This adaptive modeling
      approach was used to investigate pathway dynamics in a newly acquired
      experimental dataset describing total and phosphorylated protein signaling over
      four days in A375 melanoma cell line exposed to different kinase inhibitors.
      First, a generalized strategy was established to implement a parameter-reduced FL
      model encoding non-linear activity of a signaling network in response to
      perturbation. Next, a literature-based topology was generated and parameters of
      the FL model were derived from the full experimental dataset. Subsequently, the
      temporal evolution of model performance was evaluated by leaving time-defined
      data points out of training. Emerging discrepancies between model predictions and
      experimental data at specific time points allowed the characterization of
      potential network rearrangement. We demonstrate that this adaptive FL modeling
      approach helps to enhance our mechanistic understanding of the molecular
      plasticity of melanoma.

TI  - Prediction and Prioritization of Rare Oncogenic Mutations in the Cancer Kinome
      Using Novel Features and Multiple Classifiers.
LID - e1003545
AB  - Cancer is a genetic disease that develops through a series of somatic mutations, 
      a subset of which drive cancer progression. Although cancer genome sequencing
      studies are beginning to reveal the mutational patterns of genes in various
      cancers, identifying the small subset of “causative” mutations from the large
      subset of “non-causative” mutations, which accumulate as a consequence of the
      disease, is a challenge. In this article, we present an effective machine
      learning approach for identifying cancer-associated mutations in human protein
      kinases, a class of signaling proteins known to be frequently mutated in human
      cancers. We evaluate the performance of 11 well known supervised learners and
      show that a multiple-classifier approach, which combines the performances of
      individual learners, significantly improves the classification of known
      cancer-associated mutations. We introduce several novel features related
      specifically to structural and functional characteristics of protein kinases and 
      find that the level of conservation of the mutated residue at specific
      evolutionary depths is an important predictor of oncogenic effect. We consolidate
      the novel features and the multiple-classifier approach to prioritize and
      experimentally test a set of rare unconfirmed mutations in the epidermal growth
      factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR). Our studies identify T725M and L861R as
      rare cancer-associated mutations inasmuch as these mutations increase EGFR
      activity in the absence of the activating EGF ligand in cell-based assays.

TI  - A Systems-Level Interrogation Identifies Regulators of Drosophila Blood Cell
      Number and Survival.
LID - e1005056
AB  - In multicellular organisms, cell number is typically determined by a balance of
      intracellular signals that positively and negatively regulate cell survival and
      proliferation. Dissecting these signaling networks facilitates the understanding 
      of normal development and tumorigenesis. Here, we study signaling by the
      Drosophila PDGF/VEGF Receptor (Pvr) in embryonic blood cells (hemocytes) and in
      the related cell line Kc as a model for the requirement of PDGF/VEGF receptors in
      vertebrate cell survival and proliferation. The system allows the investigation
      of downstream and parallel signaling networks, based on the ability of Pvr to
      activate Ras/Erk, Akt/TOR, and yet-uncharacterized signaling pathway/s, which
      redundantly mediate cell survival and contribute to proliferation. Using Kc
      cells, we performed a genome wide RNAi screen for regulators of cell number in a 
      sensitized, Pvr deficient background. We identified the receptor tyrosine kinase 
      (RTK) Insulin-like receptor (InR) as a major Pvr Enhancer, and the nuclear
      hormone receptors Ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (usp), corresponding 
      to mammalian Retinoid X Receptor (RXR), as Pvr Suppressors. In vivo analysis in
      the Drosophila embryo revealed a previously unrecognized role for EcR to promote 
      apoptotic death of embryonic blood cells, which is balanced with pro-survival
      signaling by Pvr and InR. Phosphoproteomic analysis demonstrates distinct modes
      of cell number regulation by EcR and RTK signaling. We define common
      phosphorylation targets of Pvr and InR that include regulators of cell survival, 
      and unique targets responsible for specialized receptor functions. Interestingly,
      our analysis reveals that the selection of phosphorylation targets by signaling
      receptors shows qualitative changes depending on the signaling status of the
      cell, which may have wide-reaching implications for other cell regulatory
      systems.

TI  - HAM-5 Functions As a MAP Kinase Scaffold during Cell Fusion in Neurospora crassa.
LID - e1004783
AB  - Cell fusion in genetically identical Neurospora crassa germlings and in hyphae is
      a highly regulated process involving the activation of a conserved MAP kinase
      cascade that includes NRC-1, MEK-2 and MAK-2. During chemotrophic growth in
      germlings, the MAP kinase cascade members localize to conidial anastomosis tube
      (CAT) tips every ∼8 minutes, perfectly out of phase with another protein that is 
      recruited to the tip: SOFT, a recently identified scaffold for the MAK-1 MAP
      kinase pathway in Sordaria macrospora. How the MAK-2 oscillation process is
      initiated, maintained and what proteins regulate the MAP kinase cascade is
      currently unclear. A global phosphoproteomics approach using an allele of mak-2
      (mak-2Q100G) that can be specifically inhibited by the ATP analog 1NM-PP1 was
      utilized to identify MAK-2 kinase targets in germlings that were potentially
      involved in this process. One such putative target was HAM-5, a protein of
      unknown biochemical function. Previously, Δham-5 mutants were shown to be
      deficient for hyphal fusion. Here we show that HAM-5-GFP co-localized with NRC-1,
      MEK-2 and MAK-2 and oscillated with identical dynamics from the cytoplasm to CAT 
      tips during chemotropic interactions. In the Δmak-2 strain, HAM-5-GFP localized
      to punctate complexes that did not oscillate, but still localized to the germling
      tip, suggesting that MAK-2 activity influences HAM-5 function/localization.
      However, MAK-2-GFP showed cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in a Δham-5 strain
      and did not localize to puncta. Via co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HAM-5 was
      shown to physically interact with NRC-1, MEK-2 and MAK-2, suggesting that it
      functions as a scaffold/transport hub for the MAP kinase cascade members for
      oscillation and chemotropic interactions during germling and hyphal fusion in N. 
      crassa. The identification of HAM-5 as a scaffold-like protein will help to link 
      the activation of MAK-2 cascade to upstream factors and proteins involved in this
      intriguing process of fungal communication.

TI  - The Yeast Sks1p Kinase Signaling Network Regulates Pseudohyphal Growth and
      Glucose Response.
LID - e1004183
AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes a dramatic growth transition from
      its unicellular form to a filamentous state, marked by the formation of
      pseudohyphal filaments of elongated and connected cells. Yeast pseudohyphal
      growth is regulated by signaling pathways responsive to reductions in the
      availability of nitrogen and glucose, but the molecular link between pseudohyphal
      filamentation and glucose signaling is not fully understood. Here, we identify
      the glucose-responsive Sks1p kinase as a signaling protein required for
      pseudohyphal growth induced by nitrogen limitation and coupled nitrogen/glucose
      limitation. To identify the Sks1p signaling network, we applied mass
      spectrometry-based quantitative phosphoproteomics, profiling over 900
      phosphosites for phosphorylation changes dependent upon Sks1p kinase activity.
      From this analysis, we report a set of novel phosphorylation sites and highlight 
      Sks1p-dependent phosphorylation in Bud6p, Itr1p, Lrg1p, Npr3p, and Pda1p. In
      particular, we analyzed the Y309 and S313 phosphosites in the pyruvate
      dehydrogenase subunit Pda1p; these residues are required for pseudohyphal growth,
      and Y309A mutants exhibit phenotypes indicative of impaired aerobic respiration
      and decreased mitochondrial number. Epistasis studies place SKS1 downstream of
      the G-protein coupled receptor GPR1 and the G-protein RAS2 but upstream of or at 
      the level of cAMP-dependent PKA. The pseudohyphal growth and glucose signaling
      transcription factors Flo8p, Mss11p, and Rgt1p are required to achieve wild-type 
      SKS1 transcript levels. SKS1 is conserved, and deletion of the SKS1 ortholog SHA3
      in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans results in abnormal colony morphology. 
      Collectively, these results identify Sks1p as an important regulator of
      filamentation and glucose signaling, with additional relevance towards
      understanding stress-responsive signaling in C. albicans.

TI  - A Multi-Omics Approach Identifies Key Hubs Associated with Cell Type-Specific
      Responses of Airway Epithelial Cells to Staphylococcal Alpha-Toxin.
LID - e0122089
AB  - Responsiveness of cells to alpha-toxin (Hla) from Staphylococcus aureus appears
      to occur in a cell-type dependent manner. Here, we compare two human bronchial
      epithelial cell lines, i.e. Hla-susceptible 16HBE14o- and Hla-resistant S9 cells,
      by a quantitative multi-omics strategy for a better understanding of Hla-induced 
      cellular programs. Phosphoproteomics revealed a substantial impact on
      phosphorylation-dependent signaling in both cell models and highlights
      alterations in signaling pathways associated with cell-cell and cell-matrix
      contacts as well as the actin cytoskeleton as key features of early rHla-induced 
      effects. Along comparable changes in down-stream activity of major protein
      kinases significant differences between both models were found upon
      rHla-treatment including activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR 
      and mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK1/3 signaling in S9 and repression in
      16HBE14o- cells. System-wide transcript and protein expression profiling indicate
      induction of an immediate early response in either model. In addition, EGFR and
      MAPK1/3-mediated changes in gene expression suggest cellular recovery and
      survival in S9 cells but cell death in 16HBE14o- cells. Strikingly, inhibition of
      the EGFR sensitized S9 cells to Hla indicating that the cellular capacity of
      activation of the EGFR is a major protective determinant against Hla-mediated
      cytotoxic effects.

TI  - Proteome-Wide Lysine Acetylation in Cortical Astrocytes and Alterations That
      Occur during Infection with Brain Parasite Toxoplasma gondii.
LID - e0117966
AB  - Lysine acetylation is a reversible post-translational modification (PTM) that has
      been detected on thousands of proteins in nearly all cellular compartments. The
      role of this widespread PTM has yet to be fully elucidated, but can impact
      protein localization, interactions, activity, and stability. Here we present the 
      first proteome-wide survey of lysine acetylation in cortical astrocytes, a
      subtype of glia that is a component of the blood-brain barrier and a key
      regulator of neuronal function and plasticity. We identified 529 lysine
      acetylation sites across 304 proteins found in multiple cellular compartments
      that largely function in RNA processing/transcription, metabolism, chromatin
      biology, and translation. Two hundred and seventy-seven of the acetylated lysines
      we identified on 186 proteins have not been reported previously in any other cell
      type. We also mapped an acetylome of astrocytes infected with the brain parasite,
      Toxoplasma gondii. It has been shown that infection with T. gondii modulates host
      cell gene expression, including several lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) and
      deacetylase (KDAC) genes, suggesting that the host acetylome may also be altered 
      during infection. In the T. gondii-infected astrocytes, we identified 34 proteins
      exhibiting a level of acetylation >2-fold and 24 with a level of acetylation
      <2-fold relative to uninfected astrocytes. Our study documents the first
      acetylome map for cortical astrocytes, uncovers novel lysine acetylation sites,
      and demonstrates that T. gondii infection produces an altered acetylome.

TI  - Regulation of Neuronal Cav3.1 Channels by Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 (Cdk5).
LID - e0119134
AB  - Low voltage-activated (LVA) T-type Ca2+ channels activate in response to
      subthreshold membrane depolarizations and therefore represent an important source
      of Ca2+ influx near the resting membrane potential. In neurons, these proteins
      significantly contribute to control relevant physiological processes including
      neuronal excitability, pacemaking and post-inhibitory rebound burst firing. Three
      subtypes of T-type channels (Cav3.1 to Cav3.3) have been identified, and using
      functional expression of recombinant channels diverse studies have validated the 
      notion that T-type Ca2+ channels can be modulated by various endogenous ligands
      as well as by second messenger pathways. In this context, the present study
      reveals a previously unrecognized role for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in
      the regulation of native T-type channels in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, as well 
      as recombinant Cav3.1channels heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells. Cdk5 and
      its co-activators play critical roles in the regulation of neuronal
      differentiation, cortical lamination, neuronal cell migration and axon outgrowth.
      Our results show that overexpression of Cdk5 causes a significant increase in
      whole cell patch clamp currents through T-type channels in N1E-115 cells, while
      siRNA knockdown of Cdk5 greatly reduced these currents. Consistent with this,
      overexpression of Cdk5 in HEK-293 cells stably expressing Cav3.1channels
      upregulates macroscopic currents. Furthermore, using site-directed mutagenesis we
      identified a major phosphorylation site at serine 2234 within the C-terminal
      region of the Cav3.1subunit. These results highlight a novel role for Cdk5 in the
      regulation of T-type Ca2+ channels.

TI  - Loss of Prolyl Carboxypeptidase in Two-Kidney, One-Clip Goldblatt Hypertensive
      Mice.
LID - e0117899
AB  - It is well documented that angiotensin (Ang) II contributes to kidney disease
      progression. The protease prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP) is highly expressed in
      the kidney and may be renoprotective by degrading Ang II to Ang-(1-7). The aim of
      the study was to investigate whether renal PRCP protein expression and activity
      are altered in two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) Goldblatt hypertensive mice. Left
      renal artery was constricted by using 0.12 mm silver clips. Blood pressure was
      measured using telemetry over the eleven weeks of study period and revealed an
      immediate increase in 2K1C animals during the first week of clip placement which 
      was followed by a gradual decrease to baseline blood pressure. Similarly, urinary
      albumin excretion was significantly increased one week after 2K1C and returned to
      baseline levels during the following weeks. At 2 weeks and at the end of the
      study, renal pathologies were exacerbated in the 2K1C model as revealed by a
      significant increase in mesangial expansion and renal fibrosis. Renal PRCP
      expression and activity were significantly reduced in clipped kidneys.
      Immunofluorescence revealed the loss of renal tubular PRCP but not glomerular
      PRCP. In contrast, expression of prolyl endopeptidase, another enzyme capable of 
      converting Ang II into Ang-(1-7), was not affected, while angiotensin converting 
      enzyme was elevated in unclipped kidneys and renin was increased in clipped
      kidneys. Results suggest that PRCP is suppressed in 2K1C and that this
      downregulation may attenuate renoprotective effects via impaired Ang II
      degradation by PRCP.

AB  - Copper (II) oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NP) are widely used in industry and
      medicine. In our study we evaluated the response of BEAS-2B human lung cells to
      CuO NP, using Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture
      (SILAC)-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics. Pathway modeling of the protein
      differential expression showed that CuO NP affect proteins relevant in cellular
      function and maintenance, protein synthesis, cell death and survival, cell cycle 
      and cell morphology. Some of the signaling pathways represented by BEAS-2B
      proteins responsive to the NP included mTOR signaling, protein ubiquitination
      pathway, actin cytoskeleton signaling and epithelial adherens junction signaling.
      Follow-up experiments showed that CuO NP altered actin cytoskeleton, protein
      phosphorylation and protein ubiquitination level.

TI  - Functional Aspects of the EGF-Induced MAP Kinase Cascade: A Complex
      Self-Organizing System Approach.
LID - e111612
AB  - The EGF-induced MAP kinase cascade is one of the most important and best
      characterized networks in intracellular signalling. It has a vital role in the
      development and maturation of living organisms. However, when deregulated, it is 
      involved in the onset of a number of diseases. Based on a computational model
      describing a “surface” and an “internalized” parallel route, we use systems
      biology techniques to characterize aspects of the network’s functional
      organization. We examine the re-organization of protein groups from low to high
      external stimulation, define functional groups of proteins within the network,
      determine the parameter best encoding for input intensity and predict the effect 
      of protein removal to the system’s output response. Extensive functional
      re-organization of proteins is observed in the lower end of stimulus
      concentrations. As we move to higher concentrations the variability is less
      pronounced. 6 functional groups have emerged from a consensus clustering
      approach, reflecting different dynamical aspects of the network. Mutual
      information investigation revealed that the maximum activation rate of the two
      output proteins best encodes for stimulus intensity. Removal of each protein of
      the network resulted in a range of graded effects, from complete silencing to
      intense activation. Our results provide a new “vista” of the EGF-induced MAP
      kinase cascade, from the perspective of complex self-organizing systems.
      Functional grouping of the proteins reveals an organizational scheme contrasting 
      the current understanding of modular topology. The six identified groups may
      provide the means to experimentally follow the dynamics of this complex network. 
      Also, the vulnerability analysis approach may be used for the development of
      novel therapeutic targets in the context of personalized medicine.

TI  - Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Improves Insulin Sensitivity and Synergizes with
      Insulin in Human Adipose Stem Cell-Derived (hASC) Adipocytes.
LID - e111767
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has evolved as a major metabolic regulator,
      the pharmacological administration of which causes weight loss, insulin
      sensitivity and glucose control in rodents and humans. To understand the
      molecular mechanisms by which FGF21 exerts its metabolic effects, we developed a 
      human in vitro model of adipocytes to examine crosstalk between FGF21 and insulin
      signaling. Human adipose stem cell-derived (hASC) adipocytes were acutely treated
      with FGF21 alone, insulin alone, or in combination. Insulin signaling under these
      conditions was assessed by measuring tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor
      (InsR), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and serine 473 phosphorylation of
      Akt, followed by a functional assay using 14C-2-deoxyglucose [14C]-2DG to measure
      glucose uptake in these cells. FGF21 alone caused a modest increase of glucose
      uptake, but treatment with FGF21 in combination with insulin had a synergistic
      effect on glucose uptake in these cells. The presence of FGF21 also effectively
      lowered the insulin concentration required to achieve the same level of glucose
      uptake compared to the absence of FGF21 by 10-fold. This acute effect of FGF21 on
      insulin signaling was not due to IR, IGF-1R, or IRS-1 activation. Moreover, we
      observed a substantial increase in basal S473-Akt phosphorylation by FGF21 alone,
      in contrast to the minimal shift in basal glucose uptake. Taken together, our
      data demonstrate that acute co-treatment of hASC-adipocytes with FGF21 and
      insulin can result in a synergistic improvement in glucose uptake. These effects 
      were shown to occur at or downstream of Akt, or separate from the canonical
      insulin signaling pathway.

TI  - Identification of the PLK2-Dependent Phosphopeptidome by Quantitative Proteomics.
LID - e111018
AB  - Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) has been recently recognized as the major enzyme
      responsible for phosphorylation of α-synuclein at S129 in vitro and in vivo,
      suggesting that this kinase may play a key role in the pathogenesis of
      Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. Moreover PLK2 seems to be
      implicated in cell division, oncogenesis, and synaptic regulation of the brain.
      However little is known about the phosphoproteome generated by PLK2 and,
      consequently the overall impact of PLK2 on cellular signaling. To fill this gap
      we exploited an approach based on in vitro kinase assay and quantitative
      phosphoproteomics. A proteome-derived peptide library obtained by digestion of
      undifferentiated human neuroblastoma cell line was exhaustively dephosphorylated 
      by lambda phosphatase followed by incubation with or without PLK2 recombinant
      kinase. Stable isotope labeling based quantitative phosphoproteomics was applied 
      to identify the phosphosites generated by PLK2. A total of 98 unique
      PLK2-dependent phosphosites from 89 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS.
      Analysis of the primary structure of the identified phosphosites allowed the
      detailed definition of the kinase specificity and the compilation of a list of
      potential PLK2 targets among those retrieved in PhosphositePlus, a curated
      database of in cell/vivo phosphorylation sites.

TI  - Whole Proteome Analysis of Mouse Lymph Nodes in Cutaneous Anthrax.
LID - e110873
AB  - This study aimed to characterize a soluble proteome of popliteal lymph nodes
      during lymphadenitis induced by intradermal injection of Bacillus anthracis
      Sterne spores in mice using tandem LC-MS/MS and reverse-phase protein microarray 
      with antibodies specific to epitopes of phosphorylated proteins. More than 380
      proteins were detected in the normal intra-nodal lymph, while the infectious
      process resulted in the profound changes in the protein abundances and appearance
      of 297 unique proteins. These proteins belong to an array of processes reflecting
      response to wounding, inflammation and perturbations of hemostasis, innate immune
      response, coagulation and fibrinolysis, regulation of body fluid levels and
      vascular disturbance among others. Comparison of lymph and serum revealed 83
      common proteins. Also, using 71 antibodies specific to total and phosphorylated
      forms of proteins we carried initial characterization of circulating lymph
      phosphoproteome which brought additional information regarding signaling pathways
      operating in the lymphatics. The results demonstrate that the proteome of
      intra-nodal lymph serves as a sensitive sentinel of the processes occurring
      within the lymph nodes during infection. The acute innate response of the lymph
      nodes to anthrax is accompanied by cellular damage and inflammation with a large 
      number of up- and down-regulated proteins many of which are distinct from those
      detected in serum. MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier
      PXD001342.

      Shp2 in Noonan and LEOPARD Syndrome.
LID - e106682
AB  - Noonan syndrome (NS) and LEOPARD syndrome (LS) cause congenital afflictions such 
      as short stature, hypertelorism and heart defects. More than 50% of NS and almost
      all of LS cases are caused by activating and inactivating mutations of the
      phosphatase Shp2, respectively. How these biochemically opposing mutations lead
      to similar clinical outcomes is not clear. Using zebrafish models of NS and LS
      and mass spectrometry-based phosphotyrosine proteomics, we identified a
      down-regulated peptide of Fer kinase in both NS and LS. Further investigation
      showed a role for Fer during development, where morpholino-based knockdown caused
      craniofacial defects, heart edema and short stature. During gastrulation, loss of
      Fer caused convergence and extension defects without affecting cell fate.
      Moreover, Fer knockdown cooperated with NS and LS, but not wild type Shp2 to
      induce developmental defects, suggesting a role for Fer in the pathogenesis of
      both NS and LS.
