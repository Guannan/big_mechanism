TI  - NOVEL ROLES FOR INSULIN RECEPTOR (IR) IN ADIPOCYTES AND SKELETAL MUSCLE CELLS VIA
      NEW AND UNEXPECTED SUBSTRATES.
PG  - 2815-34
AB  - The insulin signaling pathway regulates whole-body glucose homeostasis by
      transducing extracellular signals from the insulin receptor (IR) to downstream
      intracellular targets, thus coordinating a multitude of biological functions.
      Dysregulation of IR or its signal transduction is associated with insulin
      resistance, which may culminate in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Following initial
      stimulation of IR, insulin signaling diverges into different pathways, activating
      multiple substrates which have roles in various metabolic and cellular processes.
      The integration of multiple pathways arising from IR activation continues to
      expand as new IR substrates are identified and characterized. Accordingly, our
      review will focus on roles for IR substrates as they pertain to three primary
      areas: Metabolism/glucose uptake, Mitogenesis/growth, and Aging/Longevity. While 
      IR functions in a seemingly pleotropic manner in many cell types, through these
      three main roles in fat and skeletal muscle cells, IR multi-tasks to regulate
      whole-body glucose homeostasis to impact healthspan and lifespan.

TI  - LY2801653 is an orally bioavailable multi-kinase inhibitor with potent activity
      against MET, MST1R, and other oncoproteins, and displays anti-tumor activities in
      mouse xenograft models.
PG  - 833-44
AB  - The HGF/MET signaling pathway regulates a wide variety of normal cellular
      functions that can be subverted to support neoplasia, including cell
      proliferation, survival, apoptosis, scattering and motility, invasion, and
      angiogenesis. MET over-expression (with or without gene amplification), aberrant 
      autocrine or paracrine ligand production, and missense MET mutations are
      mechanisms that lead to activation of the MET pathway in tumors and are
      associated with poor prognostic outcome. We report here preclinical development
      of a potent, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor LY2801653 targeting
      MET kinase. LY2801653 is a type-II ATP competitive, slow-off inhibitor of MET
      tyrosine kinase with a dissociation constant (Ki) of 2 nM, a pharmacodynamic
      residence time (Koff) of 0.00132 min−1 and t1/2 of 525 min. LY2801653
      demonstrated in vitro effects on MET pathway-dependent cell scattering and cell
      proliferation; in vivo anti-tumor effects in MET amplified (MKN45), MET autocrine
      (U-87MG, and KP4) and MET over-expressed (H441) xenograft models; and in vivo
      vessel normalization effects. LY2801653 also maintained potency against 13 MET
      variants, each bearing a single-point mutation. In subsequent nonclinical
      characterization, LY2801653 was found to have potent activity against several
      other receptor tyrosine oncokinases including MST1R, FLT3, AXL, MERTK, TEK, ROS1,
      DDR1/2 and against the serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2. The potential value of
      MET and other inhibited targets within a number of malignancies (such as colon,
      bile ducts, and lung) is discussed. LY2801653 is currently in phase 1 clinical
      testing in patients with advanced cancer (trial I3O-MC-JSBA,
      NCT01285037).Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this

TI  - Signal transduction in cerebral arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage—a
      phosphoproteomic approach.
PG  - 1259-69
AB  - After subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), pathologic changes in cerebral arteries
      contribute to delayed cerebral ischemia and poor outcome. We hypothesize such
      changes are triggered by early intracellular signals, targeting of which may
      prevent SAH-induced vasculopathy. We performed an unbiased quantitative analysis 
      of early SAH-induced phosphorylations in cerebral arteries and evaluated
      identified signaling components as targets for prevention of delayed vasculopathy
      and ischemia. Labeled phosphopeptides from rat cerebral arteries were quantified 
      by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Selected SAH-induced
      phosphorylations were validated by immunoblotting and monitored over a 24-hour
      time course post SAH. Moreover, inhibition of key phosphoproteins was performed. 
      Major SAH-induced phosphorylations were observed on focal adhesion complexes,
      extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase 
      II, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) and c-Jun, the
      latter two downstream of ERK1/2. Inhibition of ERK1/2 6-hour post SAH prevented
      increases in cerebrovascular constrictor receptors, matrix metalloprotease-9,
      wall thickness, and improved neurologic outcome. STAT3 inhibition partially
      mimicked these effects. The study shows that quantitative mass spectrometry is a 
      strong approach to study in vivo vascular signaling. Moreover, it shows that
      targeting of ERK1/2 prevents delayed pathologic changes in cerebral arteries and 
      improves outcome, and identifies SAH-induced signaling components downstream and 
      upstream of ERK1/2.

      Phosphoproteomics*.
PG  - 2070-80
AB  - Although K-Ras, Cdc42, and PAK4 signaling are commonly deregulated in cancer,
      only a few studies have sought to comprehensively examine the spectrum of
      phosphorylation-mediated signaling downstream of each of these key signaling
      nodes. In this study, we completed a label-free quantitative analysis of
      oncogenic K-Ras, activated Cdc42, and PAK4-mediated phosphorylation signaling,
      and report relative quantitation of 2152 phosphorylated peptides on 1062
      proteins. We define the overlap in phosphopeptides regulated by K-Ras, Cdc42, and
      PAK4, and find that perturbation of these signaling components affects
      phosphoproteins associated with microtubule depolymerization, cytoskeletal
      organization, and the cell cycle. These findings provide a resource for future
      studies to characterize novel targets of oncogenic K-Ras signaling and validate
      biomarkers of PAK4 inhibition.

TI  - Dissection of TBK1 signaling via phosphoproteomics in lung cancer cells.
PG  - 12414-9
AB  - TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) has emerged as a novel therapeutic target for
      unspecified subset of lung cancers. TBK1 reportedly mediates prosurvival
      signaling by activating NF-κB and AKT. However, we observed that TBK1 knockdown
      also decreased viability of cells expressing constitutively active NF-κB and
      interferon regulatory factor 3. Basal phospho-AKT level was not reduced after
      TBK1 knockdown in TBK1-sensitive lung cancer cells, implicating that TBK1
      mediates unknown survival mechanisms. To gain better insight into TBK1 survival
      signaling, we searched for altered phosphoproteins using mass spectrometry
      following RNAi-mediated TBK1 knockdown. In total, we identified 2,080
      phosphoproteins (4,621 peptides), of which 385 proteins (477 peptides) were
      affected after TBK1 knockdown. A view of the altered network identified a central
      role of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and known PLK1 targets. We found that TBK1
      directly phosphorylated PLK1 in vitro. TBK1 phosphorylation was induced at
      mitosis, and loss of TBK1 impaired mitotic phosphorylation of PLK1 in
      TBK1-sensitive lung cancer cells. Furthermore, lung cancer cell sensitivity to
      TBK1 was highly correlated with sensitivity to pharmacological PLK inhibition. We
      additionally found that TBK1 knockdown decreased metadherin phosphorylation at
      Ser-568. Metadherin was associated with poor outcome in lung cancer, and loss of 
      metadherin caused growth inhibition and apoptosis in TBK1-sensitive lung cancer
      cells. These results collectively revealed TBK1 as a mitosis regulator through
      activation of PLK1 and also suggested metadherin as a putative TBK1 downstream
      effector involved in lung cancer cell survival.

TI  - Alterations of Histone H1 Phosphorylation During Bladder Carcinogenesis.
PG  - 3317-26
AB  - There is a crucial need for development of prognostic and predictive biomarkers
      in human bladder carcinogenesis in order to personalize preventive and
      therapeutic strategies and improve outcomes. Epigenetic alterations, such as
      histone modifications, are implicated in the genetic dysregulation that is
      fundamental to carcinogenesis. Here we focus on profiling the histone
      modifications during the progression of bladder cancer. Histones were extracted
      from normal human bladder epithelial cells, an immortalized human bladder
      epithelial cell line (hTERT), and four human bladder cancer cell lines (RT4, J82,
      T24, and UMUC3) ranging from superficial low-grade to invasive high-grade
      cancers. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) profiling revealed a
      statistically significant increase in phosphorylation of H1 linker histones from 
      normal human bladder epithelial cells to low-grade superficial to high-grade
      invasive bladder cancer cells. This finding was further validated by
      immunohistochemical staining of the normal epithelium and transitional cell
      cancer from human bladders. Cell cycle analysis of histone H1 phosphorylation by 
      western blotting showed an increase of phosphorylation from G0/G1 phase to M
      phase, again supporting this as a proliferative marker. Changes in histone H1
      phosphorylation status may further clarify epigenetic changes during bladder
      carcinogenesis and provide diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers or targets for
      future therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Nutrient Regulation of the mTOR Complex 1 Signaling Pathway.
PG  - 463-73
AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an evolutionally conserved kinase
      which exists in two distinct structural and functional complexes, mTOR complex 1 
      (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Of the two complexes, mTORC1 couples
      nutrient abundance to cell growth and proliferation by sensing and integrating a 
      variety of inputs arising from amino acids, cellular stresses, energy status, and
      growth factors. Defects in mTORC1 regulation are implicated in the development of
      many metabolic diseases, including cancer and diabetes. Over the past decade,
      significant advances have been made in deciphering the complexity of the
      signaling processes contributing to mTORC1 regulation and function, but the
      mechanistic details are still not fully understood. In particular, how amino acid
      availability is sensed by cells and signals to mTORC1 remains unclear. In this
      review, we discuss the current understanding of nutrient-dependent control of
      mTORC1 signaling and will focus on the key components involved in amino acid
      signaling to mTORC1.

TI  - Dynamic Adipocyte Phosphoproteome Reveals that Akt Directly Regulates mTORC2.
PG  - 1009-20
AB  - A major challenge of the post-genomics era is to define the connectivity of
      protein phosphorylation networks. Here, we quantitatively delineate the insulin
      signaling network in adipocytes by high-resolution mass spectrometry-based
      proteomics. These data reveal the complexity of intracellular protein
      phosphorylation. We identified 37,248 phosphorylation sites on 5,705 proteins in 
      this single-cell type, with approximately 15% responding to insulin. We
      integrated these large-scale phosphoproteomics data using a machine learning
      approach to predict physiological substrates of several diverse insulin-regulated
      kinases. This led to the identification of an Akt substrate, SIN1, a core
      component of the mTORC2 complex. The phosphorylation of SIN1 by Akt was found to 
      regulate mTORC2 activity in response to growth factors, revealing topological
      insights into the Akt/mTOR signaling network. The dynamic phosphoproteome
      described here contains numerous phosphorylation sites on proteins involved in
      diverse molecular functions and should serve as a useful functional resource for 
      cell biologists.

AB  - Quantitative proteomics is an important tool to study biological processes, but
      so far it has been challenging to apply to zebrafish. Here, we describe a large
      scale quantitative analysis of the zebrafish proteome using a combination of
      stable isotope labeling and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
      Proteins derived from the fully labeled fish were used as a standard to quantify 
      changes during embryonic heart development. LC-MS-assisted analysis of the
      proteome of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule zebrafish morphants
      revealed a down-regulation of components of the network required for cell
      adhesion and maintenance of cell shape as well as secondary changes due to arrest
      of cellular differentiation. Quantitative proteomics in zebrafish using the
      stable isotope-labeling technique provides an unprecedented resource to study
      developmental processes in zebrafish.

PG  - 555-64
AB  - Flux through metabolic pathways is inherently sensitive to the levels of specific
      substrates and products, but cellular metabolismis also managed by integrated
      control mechanisms that sense the nutrient and energy status of a cell or
      organism. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a
      protein kinase complex ubiquitous to eukaryotic cells, has emerged as a critical 
      signaling node that links nutrient sensing to the coordinated regulation of
      cellular metabolism. Here, the role of mTORC1 as a conduit between cellular
      growth conditions and the anabolic processes that promote cell growth is
      discussed. The emerging network of signaling pathways by which mTORC1 integrates 
      systemic signals, in the form of secreted growth factors, with local signals, in 
      the form of cellular nutrients (amino acids, glucose, and oxygen) and energy
      (ATP) is detailed. Our expanding understanding of the exquisite regulatory
      network upstream of mTORC1 provides molecular insights into the integrated
      sensing mechanisms by which diverse cellular signals converge to control cell
      physiology.

LID - 10.1038/ni.2590
AB  - αβT cell differentiation from thymic precursors is a complex process, explored
      here with the breadth of ImmGen expression datasets, analyzing how
      differentiation of thymic precursors gives rise to transcriptomes. After
      surprisingly gradual changes though early T commitment, transit through the
      CD4+CD8+ stage involves a shutdown or rare breadth, and correlating tightly with 
      MYC. MHC-driven selection promotes a large-scale transcriptional reactivation. We
      identify distinct signatures that mark cells destined for positive selection
      versus apoptotic deletion. Differential expression of surprisingly few genes
      accompany CD4 or CD8 commitment, a similarity that carries through to peripheral 
      T cells and their activation, revealed by mass cytometry phosphoproteomics. The
      novel transcripts identified as candidate mediators of key transitions help
      define the “known unknown” of thymocyte differentiation.

TI  - Structure and dynamics of molecular networks: A novel paradigm of drug discovery:
      A comprehensive review.
PG  - 333-408
AB  - Despite considerable progress in genome- and proteome-based high-throughput
      screening methods and in rational drug design, the increase in approved drugs in 
      the past decade did not match the increase of drug development costs. Network
      description and analysis not only gives a systems-level understanding of drug
      action and disease complexity, but can also help to improve the efficiency of
      drug design. We give a comprehensive assessment of the analytical tools of
      network topology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity,
      protein structure, protein-protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction
      and metabolic networks in the discovery of drug targets is summarized. We propose
      that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The “central hit strategy”
      selectively targets central node/edges of the flexible networks of infectious
      agents or cancer cells to kill them. The “network influence strategy” works
      against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid networks
      needs to be achieved. It is shown how network techniques can help in the
      identification of single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug
      target candidates. We review the recent boom in network methods helping hit
      identification, lead selection optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing
      side-effects and drug toxicity. Successful network-based drug development
      strategies are shown through the examples of infections, cancer, metabolic
      diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Summarizing >1200 references we
      suggest an optimized protocol of network-aided drug development, and provide a
      list of systems-level hallmarks of drug quality. Finally, we highlight
      network-related drug development trends helping to achieve these hallmarks by a
      cohesive, global approach.

TI  - Towards Systematic Discovery of Signaling Networks in Budding Yeast Filamentous
      Growth Stress Response Using Interventional Phosphorylation Data.
LID - e1003077
AB  - Reversible phosphorylation is one of the major mechanisms of signal transduction,
      and signaling networks are critical regulators of cell growth and development.
      However, few of these networks have been delineated completely. Towards this end,
      quantitative phosphoproteomics is emerging as a useful tool enabling large-scale 
      determination of relative phosphorylation levels. However, phosphoproteomics
      differs from classical proteomics by a more extensive sampling limitation due to 
      the limited number of detectable sites per protein. Here, we propose a
      comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline customized for phosphoproteome data 
      from interventional experiments for identifying key proteins in specific
      pathways, discovering the protein-protein interactions and inferring the
      signaling network. We also made an effort to partially compensate for the missing
      value problem, a chronic issue for proteomics studies. The dataset used for this 
      study was generated using SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell
      culture) technique with interventional experiments (kinase-dead mutations). The
      major components of the pipeline include phosphopeptide meta-analysis,
      correlation network analysis and causal relationship discovery. We have
      successfully applied our pipeline to interventional experiments identifying
      phosphorylation events underlying the transition to a filamentous growth form in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified 5 high-confidence proteins from
      meta-analysis, and 19 hub proteins from correlation analysis (Pbi2p and Hsp42p
      were identified by both analyses). All these proteins are involved in stress
      responses. Nine of them have direct or indirect evidence of involvement in
      filamentous growth. In addition, we tested four of our predicted proteins, Nth1p,
      Pbi2p, Pdr12p and Rcn2p, by interventional phenotypic experiments and all of them
      present differential invasive growth, providing prospective validation of our
      approach. This comprehensive pipeline presents a systematic way for discovering
      signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest
      candidate proteins for further investigation. We anticipate the methodology to be
      applicable as well to other interventional studies via different experimental
      platforms.

AB  - The biological properties of tumor cells are known to be regulated by a multitude
      of cytokines and growth factors, which include epidermal growth factor receptor
      agonists and members of the transforming growth factor β family. Furthermore, the
      recent explosion of research in the field of chemokine function as mediators of
      tumor progression has led to the possibility that these small, immunomodulatory
      proteins also play key roles in carcinogenesis and may, therefore, be potential
      targets for novel therapeutic approaches. In this review, we will summarize
      recently reported findings in chemokine biology with a focus on the
      gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Hyperphosphorylation of polycystin-2 at a critical residue in disease reveals an 
      essential role for polycystin-1-regulated dephosphorylation.
PG  - 1924-39
AB  - Mutations in PKD1 (85%) or PKD2 (15%) account for almost all cases of autosomal
      dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The ADPKD proteins, termed as
      polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), interact via their C-termini to form a
      receptor–ion channel complex whose function and regulation are not fully
      understood. Here, we report the first phosphorylated residue (Ser829) in PC2,
      whose dephosphorylation is mediated by PC1 binding through the recruitment of
      protein phosphatase-1 alpha (PP1α). Using a new phosphospecific antibody (pPC2)
      to this site, we demonstrate that Ser829 is phosphorylated by Protein kinase A
      (PKA) but remains constitutively phosphorylated in cells and tissues lacking PC1.
      cAMP increased pSer829 basolateral localization in MDCK cells in a time dependent
      manner and was essential for pronephric development in Xenopus embryos. When
      constitutively expressed, a complex phenotype associated with enhanced
      ATP-dependent ER Ca2+ release and loss of growth suppression was observed in
      cycling cells. These results reveal a reciprocal functional link between PC1 and 
      PC2 which is critically dependent on their interaction. Unopposed cAMP stimulated
      hyperphosphorylation of PC2 in the absence of functional PC1 could contribute to 
      cyst initiation in PKD1 patients and represents a new molecular paradigm in
      understanding ADPKD pathogenesis.

TI  - The heparanase/syndecan-1 axis in cancer: mechanisms and therapies.
PG  - 2294-306
AB  - Heparanase is an endoglucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate chains of
      proteoglycans. In many malignancies, high heparanase expression and activity
      correlate with an aggressive tumor phenotype. A major consequence of heparanase
      action in cancer is a robust up-regulation of growth factor expression and
      increased shedding of syndecan-1, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan.
      Substantial evidence indicates that heparanase and syndecan-1 work together to
      drive growth factor signaling and regulate cell behaviors that enhance tumor
      growth, dissemination, angiogenesis and osteolysis. Pre-clinical and clinical
      studies have demonstrated that therapies targeting the heparanase/syndecan-1 axis
      hold promise in blocking the aggressive behavior of cancer.

TI  - Translating mRNAs strongly correlate to proteins in a multivariate manner and
      their translation ratios are phenotype specific.
PG  - 4743-54
AB  - As a well-known phenomenon, total mRNAs poorly correlate to proteins in their
      abundances as reported. Recent findings calculated with bivariate models
      suggested even poorer such correlation, whereas focusing on the translating mRNAs
      (ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound mRNAs, RNC-mRNAs) subset. In this study, we
      analysed the relative abundances of mRNAs, RNC-mRNAs and proteins on genome-wide 
      scale, comparing human lung cancer A549 and H1299 cells with normal human
      bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, respectively. As discovered, a strong
      correlation between RNC-mRNAs and proteins in their relative abundances could be 
      established through a multivariate linear model by integrating the mRNA length as
      a key factor. The R2 reached 0.94 and 0.97 in A549 versus HBE and H1299 versus
      HBE comparisons, respectively. This correlation highlighted that the mRNA length 
      significantly contributes to the translational modulation, especially to the
      translational initiation, favoured by its correlation with the mRNA translation
      ratio (TR) as observed. We found TR is highly phenotype specific, which was
      substantiated by both pathway analysis and biased TRs of the splice variants of
      BDP1 gene, which is a key transcription factor of transfer RNAs. These findings
      revealed, for the first time, the intrinsic and genome-wide translation
      modulations at translatomic level in human cells at steady-state, which are
      tightly correlated to the protein abundance and functionally relevant to cellular
      phenotypes.

AB  - While working to understand how senescence is maintained in the presence of
      oncogenic Ras, Deschênes-Simard et al. find that attenuating ERK signaling
      prevents Ras-induced senescence. With ERK signaling inhibited, oncogenic Ras is
      then able to transform cells. ERK signaling promotes the proteasome-dependent
      degradation of proteins required for critical processes, such as cell cycle
      progression. In prostate neoplasms, high levels of phosphorylated ERK correlated 
      with a lower Gleason score and delayed disease relapse after treatment.

      to the family of the POK (poxvirus and zinc finger and Krüppel)/ZBTB (zinc finger
      and broad complex, tramtrack, and bric à brac) factors. Generally considered
      transcriptional repressors, several of these genes play fundamental roles in cell
      lineage fate decision in various tissues, programming specific tasks throughout
      the life of the organism. Here, we focus on functions of
      leukemia/lymphoma-related factor/POK erythroid myeloid ontogenic factor, which is
      probably one of the most exciting and yet enigmatic members of the POK/ZBTB
      family.

TI  - Structure of ERK2 bound to PEA-15 reveals a mechanism for rapid release of
      activated MAPK.
PG  - 1681
AB  - ERK1/2 kinases are the principal effectors of a central signaling cascade that
      converts extracellular stimuli into cell proliferation and migration responses
      and, when deregulated, can promote cell oncogenic transformation. The scaffolding
      protein PEA-15 is a death effector domain (DED) protein that directly interacts
      with ERK1/2 and affects ERK1/2 subcellular localization and phosphorylation.
      Here, to understand this ERK1/2 signaling complex, we have solved the crystal
      structures of PEA-15 bound to three different ERK2 phospho-conformers. The
      structures reveal that PEA-15 uses a bipartite binding mode, occupying two key
      docking sites of ERK2. Remarkably, PEA-15 can efficiently bind the ERK2
      activation loop in the critical Thr-X-Tyr region in different phosphorylation
      states. PEA-15 binding triggers an extended allosteric conduit in dually
      phosphorylated ERK2, disrupting key features of active ERK2. At the same time
      PEA-15 binding protects ERK2 from dephosphorylation, thus setting the stage for
      immediate ERK activity upon its release from the PEA-15 inhibitory complex.

TI  - The Nucleus- and Endoplasmic Reticulum-Targeted Forms of Protein Tyrosine
      Phosphatase 61F Regulate Drosophila Growth, Life Span, and Fecundity.
PG  - 1345-56
AB  - The protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) T cell PTP (TCPTP) and PTP1B share a
      high level of catalytic domain sequence and structural similarity yet display
      distinct differences in substrate recognition and function. Their noncatalytic
      domains contribute to substrate selectivity and function by regulating TCPTP
      nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and targeting PTP1B to the endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER). The Drosophila TCPTP/PTP1B orthologue PTP61F has two variants with
      identical catalytic domains that are differentially targeted to the ER and
      nucleus. Here we demonstrate that the PTP61F variants differ in their ability to 
      negatively regulate insulin signaling in vivo, with the nucleus-localized form
      (PTP61Fn) being more effective than the ER-localized form (PTP61Fm). We report
      that PTP61Fm is reliant on the adaptor protein Dock to attenuate insulin
      signaling in vivo. Also, we show that the PTP61F variants differ in their
      capacities to regulate growth, with PTP61Fn but not PTP61Fm attenuating cellular 
      proliferation. Furthermore, we generate a mutant lacking both PTP61F variants,
      which displays a reduction in median life span and a decrease in female
      fecundity, and show that both variants are required to rescue these mutant
      phenotypes. Our findings define the role of PTP61F in life span and fecundity and
      reinforce the importance of subcellular localization in mediating PTP function in
      vivo.

TI  - Systems biology approaches to identify developmental bases for lung diseases.
PG  - 514-22
AB  - A greater understanding of the regulatory processes contributing to lung
      development could be helpful to identify strategies to ameliorate morbidity and
      mortality in premature infants and to identify individuals at risk for congenital
      and/or chronic lung diseases. Over the past decade, genomics technologies have
      enabled the production of rich gene expression databases providing information
      for all genes across developmental time or in diseased tissue. These data sets
      facilitate systems biology approaches for identifying underlying biological
      modules and programs contributing to the complex processes of normal development,
      and those that may be associated with disease states. The next decade will
      undoubtedly see rapid and significant advances in redefining both lung
      development and disease at the systems level.

TI  - Dynamic Regulation of the Translation Initiation Helicase Complex by Mitogenic
      Signal Transduction to Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4G.
PG  - 937-46
AB  - Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), comprising the cap-binding
      protein eIF4E, the helicase eIF4A, and the central scaffold eIF4G, is a
      convergence node for a complex signaling network that controls protein synthesis.
      Together with eIF3 and eIF4A/4B, eIF4G recruits ribosomal subunits to mRNAs and
      facilitates 5′ untranslated region unwinding. Mammalian eIF4G contains three HEAT
      domains and unstructured regions involved in protein-protein interactions.
      Despite detailed eIF4G structure data, the mechanisms controlling initiation
      scaffold formation remain obscure. We found a new, highly regulated eIF4B/-3
      binding site within the HEAT-1/-2 interdomain linker, harboring two
      phosphorylation sites that we identified as substrates for Erk1/2 and casein
      kinase 2. Phorbol ester-induced sequential phosphorylation of both sites detached
      HEAT-2 from the complex with eIF4A/-4B/-3 and stimulated the association of
      HEAT-3 with the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal integrating kinase Mnk1. 
      Our results provide a mechanistic link between intracellular signal transduction 
      and dynamic initiation complex formation coordinated by flexible eIF4G structure.

TI  - A High-throughput Assay for Phosphoprotein-specific Phosphatase Activity in
      Cellular Extracts*.
PG  - 797-806
AB  - Protein phosphatases undo the post-translational modifications of
      kinase-signaling networks, but phosphatase activation in cells is difficult to
      measure and interpret. Here, we report the design of a quantitative and
      high-throughput assay platform for monitoring cellular phosphatase activity
      toward specific phosphoprotein targets. Protein substrates of interest are
      purified recombinantly, phosphorylated in vitro using the upstream kinase, and
      adsorbed to 96-well plates. Total phosphatase extracts from cells are then added 
      to trigger a solid-phase dephosphorylation reaction. After stopping the reaction,
      phosphoprotein levels are quantified by ELISA with a phospho-specific antibody,
      and the loss of phospho-specific immunoreactivity is used as the readout of
      phosphatase activity. We illustrate the generality of the method by developing
      specific phosphatase-activity assays for the three canonical mitogen-activated
      protein phospho-kinases: ERK, JNK, and p38. The assays capture changes in
      activity with a dynamic range of 25–100-fold and are sensitive to a limit of
      detection below 25,000 cells. When applied to cytokine-induced signaling, the
      assays revealed complex and dynamic regulation of phosphatases suggesting
      cross-communication and a means for cellular memory. Our assay platform should be
      beneficial for phosphoproteomic surveys and computational-systems models of
      signaling, where phosphatases are known to be important but their activities are 
      rarely measured.

TI  - Two Distinct Populations of Exosomes Are Released from LIM1863 Colon Carcinoma
      Cell-derived Organoids*.
PG  - 587-98
AB  - Exosomes are naturally occurring biological nanomembranous vesicles (∼40 to 100
      nm) of endocytic origin that are released from diverse cell types into the
      extracellular space. They have pleiotropic functions such as antigen presentation
      and intercellular transfer of protein cargo, mRNA, microRNA, lipids, and
      oncogenic potential. Here we describe the isolation, via sequential immunocapture
      using anti-A33- and anti-EpCAM-coupled magnetic beads, of two distinct
      populations of exosomes released from organoids derived from human colon
      carcinoma cell line LIM1863. The exosome populations (A33-Exos and EpCAM-Exos)
      could not be distinguished via electron microscopy and contained stereotypical
      exosome markers such as TSG101, Alix, and HSP70. The salient finding of this
      study, revealed via gel-based LC-MS/MS, was the exclusive identification in
      EpCAM-Exos of the classical apical trafficking molecules CD63 (LAMP3), mucin 13
      and the apical intestinal enzyme sucrase isomaltase and increased expression of
      dipeptidyl peptidase IV and the apically restricted pentaspan membrane
      glycoprotein prominin 1. In contrast, the A33-Exos preparation was enriched with 
      basolateral trafficking molecules such as early endosome antigen 1, the Golgi
      membrane protein ADP-ribosylation factor, and clathrin. Our observations are
      consistent with EpCAM- and A33-Exos being released from the apical and
      basolateral surfaces, respectively, and the EpCAM-Exos proteome profile with
      widely published stereotypical exosomes. A proteome analysis of LIM1863-derived
      shed microvesicles (sMVs) was also performed in order to clearly distinguish A33-
      and EpCAM-Exos from sMVs. Intriguingly, several members of the MHC class I family
      of antigen presentation molecules were exclusively observed in A33-Exos, whereas 
      neither MHC class I nor MHC class II molecules were observed via MS in
      EpCAM-Exos. Additionally, we report for the first time in any extracellular
      vesicle study the colocalization of EpCAM, claudin-7, and CD44 in EpCAM-Exos.
      Given that these molecules are known to complex together to promote tumor
      progression, further characterization of exosome subpopulations will enable a
      deeper understanding of their possible role in regulation of the tumor
      microenvironment.

LID - 10.1042/BJ20121456
AB  - Recent advances in proteomics have facilitated the analysis of the kinome ‘en
      masse’. What these studies have revealed is a surprisingly dynamic network of
      kinase responses to highly selective kinase inhibitors, thereby illustrating the 
      complex biological responses to these small molecules. Moreover these studies
      have identified key transcription factors, such as c-Myc and FOXO (forkhead box
      O), that play pivotal roles in kinome reprogramming in cancer cells. Since many
      kinase inhibitors fail despite a high efficacy of blocking their intended
      targets, elucidating kinome changes at a more global level will be essential to
      understanding the mechanisms of kinase inhibitor pharmacology. The development of
      technologies to study the kinome, as well as examples of kinome resilience and
      reprogramming, will be discussed in the present review.

PG  - 1519-27
AB  - The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α senses environmental stressors and
      orchestrates inflammatory and immunomodulatory reactions. However, the molecular 
      mechanism how p38α controls immunomodulatory responses in myeloid cells remains
      elusive. We found that in monocytes and macrophages, p38α activated the
      mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in vitro and in vivo. p38α
      signaling in myeloid immune cells promoted interleukin (IL)-10 but inhibited
      IL-12 expression via mTOR and blocked the differentiation of proinflammatory CD4+
      T helper 1 cells. Cellular stress induced p38α-mediated mTOR activation that was 
      independent of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) but dependent on the kinase MK2
      and on the inhibition of TSC1/TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis gene 1 and 2), a negative 
      regulatory complex of mTOR signaling. Remarkably, p38α and PI3K concurrently
      modulated mTOR to balance IL-12 and IL-10 expression. Our data links p38α to mTOR
      signaling in myeloid immune cells that is decisive for tuning the immune response
      in dependence on the environmental milieu.

TI  - Amphetamine increases phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK at synaptic sites in the rat
      striatum and medial prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 101-8
AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play a central role in cell signaling. 
      Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a prototypic subclass of MAPKs and
      is densely expressed in postmitotic neurons of adult mammalian brains. Active ERK
      translocates into the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Additionally, ERK is
      visualized in neuronal peripheries, such as distal synaptic structures. While
      nuclear ERK is a known sensitive target of psychostimulants, little is known
      about the responsiveness of synaptic ERK to stimulants. In this study, we focused
      on ERK at synaptic versus extrasynaptic sites and investigated its responses to
      the psychostimulant amphetamine in the adult rat striatum and medial prefrontal
      cortex (mPFC) in vivo. We used a pre-validated biochemical fractionation
      procedure to isolate synapse- and extrasynapse-enriched membranes. We found that 
      two common ERK isoforms (ERK1 and ERK2) were concentrated more in extrasynaptic
      fractions than in synaptic fractions in striatal and cortical neurons under
      normal conditions. At synaptic sites, ERK2 was noticeably more abundant than
      ERK1. Acute injection of amphetamine induced an increase in ERK2 phosphorylation 
      in the synaptic fraction of striatal neurons, while the drug did not alter
      extrasynaptic ERK2 phosphorylation. Similar results were observed in the mPFC. In
      both synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments, total ERK1/2 proteins remained
      stable in response to amphetamine. Our data establish the subsynaptic
      distribution pattern of MAPK/ERK in striatal and cortical neurons. Moreover, the 
      synaptic pool of ERK2 in these neurons can be selectively activated by
      amphetamine.

PG  - 661-87
AB  - Temporally and spatially controlled activation of the Aurora-A kinase (AURKA) is 
      regulates centrosome maturation, entry into mitosis, formation and function of
      the bipolar spindle, and cytokinesis. Genetic amplification, and mRNA and protein
      overexpression of Aurora-A are common in many types of solid tumor, and
      associated with aneuploidy, supernumerary centrosomes, defective mitotic
      spindles, and resistance to apoptosis. These properties have led Aurora-A to be
      considered a high value target for development of cancer therapeutics, with
      multiple agents currently in early phase clinical trials. More recently,
      identification of additional, non-mitotic functions and means of activation of
      Aurora-A during interphase neurite elongation and ciliary resorption have
      significantly expanded understanding of its function, and may offer insights into
      clinical performance of Aurora-A inhibitors. We here review mitotic and
      non-mitotic functions of Aurora-A, discuss Aurora-A regulation in the context of 
      protein structural information, and evaluate progress in understanding and
      inhibiting Aurora-A in cancer.

TI  - Secretory Protein Biogenesis and Traffic in the Early Secretory Pathway.
PG  - 383-410
AB  - The secretory pathway is responsible for the synthesis, folding, and delivery of 
      a diverse array of cellular proteins. Secretory protein synthesis begins in the
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is charged with the tasks of correctly
      integrating nascent proteins and ensuring correct post-translational modification
      and folding. Once ready for forward traffic, proteins are captured into
      ER-derived transport vesicles that form through the action of the COPII coat.
      COPII-coated vesicles are delivered to the early Golgi via distinct tethering and
      fusion machineries. Escaped ER residents and other cycling transport machinery
      components are returned to the ER via COPI-coated vesicles, which undergo similar
      tethering and fusion reactions. Ultimately, organelle structure, function, and
      cell homeostasis are maintained by modulating protein and lipid flux through the 
      early secretory pathway. In the last decade, structural and mechanistic studies
      have added greatly to the strong foundation of yeast genetics on which this field
      was built. Here we discuss the key players that mediate secretory protein
      biogenesis and trafficking, highlighting recent advances that have deepened our
      understanding of the complexity of this conserved and essential process.

TI  - Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics Analysis of Human Lens Fiber Cell Membranes.
PG  - 1135-43
AB  - Purpose.The human lens fiber cell insoluble membrane fraction contains important 
      membrane proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and cytosolic proteins that are
      strongly associated with the membrane. The purpose of this study was to
      characterize the lens fiber cell membrane proteome and phosphoproteome from human
      lenses. Methods.HPLC-mass spectrometry–based multidimensional protein
      identification technology (MudPIT), without or with phosphopeptide enrichment,
      was applied to study the proteome and phosphoproteome of lens fiber cell
      membranes, respectively. Results.In total, 951 proteins were identified,
      including 379 integral membrane and membrane-associated proteins. Enriched gene
      categories and pathways based on the proteomic analysis include carbohydrate
      metabolism (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, pyruvate
      metabolism), proteasome, cell-cell signaling and communication (GTP binding, gap 
      junction, focal adhesion), glutathione metabolism, and actin regulation. The
      combination of TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment and MudPIT analysis revealed 855
      phosphorylation sites on 271 proteins, including 455 phosphorylation sites that
      have not been previously identified. PKA, PKC, CKII, p38MAPK, and RSK are
      predicted as the major kinases for phosphorylation on the sites identified in the
      human lens membrane fraction. Conclusions.The results presented herein
      significantly expand the characterized proteome and phosphoproteome of the human 
      lens fiber cell and provide a valuable reference for future research in studies
      of lens development and disease.

TI  - High-Risk Human Papillomavirus E6 Oncoproteins Interact with 14-3-3ζ in a PDZ
      Binding Motif-Dependent Manner.
PG  - 1586-95
AB  - Cervical cancer develops through the combined activities of the human
      papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncoproteins. A defining characteristic of E6
      oncoproteins derived from cancer-causing HPV types is the presence of a PDZ
      binding motif (PBM) at the extreme carboxy terminus of the protein which is
      absent from E6 proteins derived from the so-called low-risk HPV types. Within
      this PBM is also a protein kinase A (PKA) phospho-acceptor site, which is thought
      to negatively regulate the association of E6 with its PDZ domain-containing
      substrates. We can now show that phosphorylation of E6 by PKA and/or AKT confers 
      the ability to interact with 14-3-3ζ. The interaction is direct and specific for 
      the high-risk HPV E6 oncoproteins, although there are significant differences in 
      the efficiencies with which HPV-16, HPV-18, and HPV-31 E6 oncoproteins can
      associate with 14-3-3ζ; this correlates directly with their respective
      susceptibilities to phosphorylation by PKA and/or AKT. We demonstrate here that
      the interaction between E6 and 14-3-3ζ also requires integrity of the E6 PBM, and
      downregulation of 14-3-3ζ results in a marked reduction in the levels of HPV-18
      E6 expression in HeLa cells. Using phospho-specific anti-E6 antibodies, we also
      demonstrate significant levels of E6 phosphorylation in vivo. These studies
      redefine the potential relevance of the E6 PBM in the development of cervical
      cancer, suggesting that interaction with 14-3-3ζ, as well as the more
      well-established interactions with PDZ domain-containing substrates, is likely to
      be responsible for the biological activities attributed to this region of the
      high-risk HPV E6 oncoproteins.

TI  - Identification of Novel in vivo MAP Kinase Substrates in Arabidopsis thaliana
      Through Use of Tandem Metal Oxide Affinity Chromatography*.
PG  - 369-80
AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades are important for eukaryotic
      signal transduction. They convert extracellular stimuli (e.g. some hormones,
      growth factors, cytokines, microbe- or damage-associated molecular patterns) into
      intracellular responses while at the same time amplifying the transmitting
      signal. By doing so, they ensure proper performance, and eventually survival, of 
      a given organism, for example in times of stress. MPK cascades function via
      reversible phosphorylation of cascade components MEKKs, MEKs, and MPKs. In plants
      the identity of most MPK substrates remained elusive until now. Here, we provide 
      a robust and powerful approach to identify and quantify, with high selectivity,
      site-specific phosphorylation of MPK substrate candidates in the model plant
      Arabidopsis thaliana. Our approach represents a two-step chromatography combining
      phosphoprotein enrichment using Al(OH)3-based metal oxide affinity
      chromatography, tryptic digest of enriched phosphoproteins, and TiO2-based metal 
      oxide affinity chromatography to enrich phosphopeptides from complex protein
      samples. When applied to transgenic conditional gain-of-function Arabidopsis
      plants supporting in planta activation of MPKs, the approach allows direct
      measurement and quantification ex vivo of site-specific phosphorylation of
      several reported and many yet unknown putative MPK substrates in just a single
      experiment.

TI  - Linking Proteomic and Transcriptional Data through the Interactome and Epigenome 
      Reveals a Map of Oncogene-induced Signaling.
LID - e1002887
AB  - Cellular signal transduction generally involves cascades of post-translational
      protein modifications that rapidly catalyze changes in protein-DNA interactions
      and gene expression. High-throughput measurements are improving our ability to
      study each of these stages individually, but do not capture the connections
      between them. Here we present an approach for building a network of physical
      links among these data that can be used to prioritize targets for pharmacological
      intervention. Our method recovers the critical missing links between proteomic
      and transcriptional data by relating changes in chromatin accessibility to
      changes in expression and then uses these links to connect proteomic and
      transcriptome data. We applied our approach to integrate epigenomic,
      phosphoproteomic and transcriptome changes induced by the variant III mutation of
      the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII) in a cell line model of
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). To test the relevance of the network, we used
      small molecules to target highly connected nodes implicated by the network model 
      that were not detected by the experimental data in isolation and we found that a 
      large fraction of these agents alter cell viability. Among these are two
      compounds, ICG-001, targeting CREB binding protein (CREBBP), and PKF118–310,
      targeting β-catenin (CTNNB1), which have not been tested previously for
      effectiveness against GBM. At the level of transcriptional regulation, we used
      chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to experimentally determine
      the genome-wide binding locations of p300, a transcriptional co-regulator highly 
      connected in the network. Analysis of p300 target genes suggested its role in
      tumorigenesis. We propose that this general method, in which experimental
      measurements are used as constraints for building regulatory networks from the
      interactome while taking into account noise and missing data, should be
      applicable to a wide range of high-throughput datasets.

TI  - Vasopressin inhibits apoptosis in renal collecting duct cells.
PG  - F177-88
AB  - The peptide hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a critical role in
      regulating salt and water transport in the mammalian kidney. Recent studies have 
      also demonstrated that AVP can promote cell survival in neuronal cells through V1
      receptors. The current study addresses whether AVP can inhibit apoptosis in
      kidney collecting duct cells via V2 receptors and also explores the downstream
      signaling pathways regulating this phenomenon. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
      transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling analysis and caspase cleavage 
      assays demonstrated that 1-desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) inhibited
      apoptosis induced by various agents (staurosporine, actinomycin D, and
      cycloheximide) in cultured mouse cortical collecting duct cells (mpkCCD).
      Incubation with dDAVP also inhibited apoptosis induced by the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitor LY294002, suggesting that 
      the antiapoptotic effects of dDAVP are largely independent of PI3K signaling. The
      V2 receptor antagonist SR121463 completely abolished the antiapoptotic effects of
      dDAVP. In addition, incubation with 8-cpt-cAMP, a cell-permeable analog of cAMP, 
      reproduced the antiapoptotic effects of dDAVP. Both dDAVP and 8-cpt-cAMP
      increased phosphorylation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bad and Bok. Bad
      phosphorylation at Ser-112 and Ser-155 is known to inhibit its proapoptotic
      activity. Preincubation with H89 blocked dDAVP-induced phosphorylation of both
      Bad and Bok, suggesting dependence on protein kinase A (PKA). This study provides
      evidence that AVP can inhibit apoptosis through the V2 receptor and downstream
      cAMP-mediated pathways in mammalian kidney. The antiapoptotic action of AVP may
      be relevant to a number of physiological and pathophysiological conditions
      including osmotic tolerance in the inner medulla, escape from AVP-induced
      antidiuresis, and polycystic kidney disease.

TI  - Regulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor signalling and trafficking by Src
      and Eps8.
PG  - 613-24
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) mediate a wide spectrum of cellular
      responses that are crucial for development and wound healing. However, aberrant
      FGFR activity leads to cancer. Activated growth factor receptors undergo
      stimulated endocytosis, but can continue to signal along the endocytic pathway.
      Endocytic trafficking controls the duration and intensity of signalling, and
      growth factor receptor signalling can lead to modifications of trafficking
      pathways. We have developed live-cell imaging methods for studying FGFR dynamics 
      to investigate mechanisms that coordinate the interplay between receptor
      trafficking and signal transduction. Activated FGFR enters the cell following
      recruitment to pre-formed clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, FGFR activation
      stimulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis; FGF treatment increases the number of
      CCPs, including those undergoing endocytosis, and this effect is mediated by Src 
      and its phosphorylation target Eps8. Eps8 interacts with the clathrin-mediated
      endocytosis machinery and depletion of Eps8 inhibits FGFR trafficking and
      immediate Erk signalling. Once internalized, FGFR passes through peripheral early
      endosomes en route to recycling and degredative compartments, through an Src- and
      Eps8-dependent mechanism. Thus Eps8 functions as a key coordinator in the
      interplay between FGFR signalling and trafficking. This work provides the first
      detailed mechanistic analysis of growth factor receptor clustering at the cell
      surface through signal transduction and endocytic trafficking. As we have
      characterised the Src target Eps8 as a key regulator of FGFR signalling and
      trafficking, and identified the early endocytic system as the site of

TI  - Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling Mechanisms: Devolving TrkA Responses with
      Phosphoproteomics.
PG  - 87-96
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) function through protein kinase entities located
      in the intracellular domain of each protomer. Following activation by ligand
      binding, they selectively form phosphotyrosine residues by autocatalytic
      modification. Some of these sites are involved in maintaining the active
      conformation of the kinase, while others become docking sites for various
      adaptor/effector/scaffold proteins, which, after complexing with the receptor,
      then initiate further responses through cascades of post-translational
      modifications and the generation of lipid second messengers. Although there is
      substantial overlap in the pathways and activities stimulated by this
      superfamily, the molecular features of the endodomains of the sub-families and
      the moieties that they interact with to perpetrate their signals are surprisingly
      distinct, which may play a significant role in the regulation and responses of
      the individual RTK types. Some use large scaffold proteins as the basis for most,
      if not all, of their signal-generating interactions, while others have numerous
      receptor endodomain phosphotyrosine sites that are quite overlapping in
      specificity. The members of the Trk family of receptors each have several
      tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated following stimulation, including those 
      in the kinase activation loop, but there are only two established sites (Y490 and
      Y785 on TrkA) that are known to be directly involved in signal propagation.
      Taking advantage of this limited repertoire of docking sites, we have applied
      phosphoproteomic methods to dissect the signaling responses of both the native
      protein and derivatives that have had these two sites modified. Interestingly, a 
      clear subset that was not dependent on either docking site was identified. A
      comparison with a similar set of data for EGFR indicates a considerable degree of
      similarity in the downstream signaling profile between these two RTKs.

TI  - The Role of AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC in the Pathogenesis of Central Nervous System
      Disease.
PG  - 159-92
AB  - Astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC) is a potent oncogene that regulates 
      key cellular processes underlying disease of the central nervous system (CNS).
      From its involvement in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection to its
      role in neurodegenerative disease and malignant brain tumors, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC
      facilitates cellular survival and proliferation through the control of a
      multitude of molecular signaling cascades. AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC induction by HIV-1
      and TNF highlights its importance in viral infection, and its incorporation into 
      viral vesicles supports its potential role in active viral replication.
      Overexpression of AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC in the brains of Huntington’s disease patients
      suggests its function in neurodegenerative disease, and its association with
      genetic polymorphisms in large genome-wide association studies of migraine
      patients suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of migraine headaches. In
      the field of cancer, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC promotes angiogenesis, migration, invasion,
      and enhanced tumor metabolism through key oncogenic signaling cascades. In
      response to external stress cues and cellular mechanisms to inhibit further
      growth, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC activates pathways that bypass cell checkpoints and
      potentiates signals to enhance survival and tumorigenesis. As an oncogene that
      promotes aberrant cellular processes within the CNS, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC represents 
      an important therapeutic target for the treatment of neurological disease.

TI  - Ecdysone Control of Developmental Transitions: Lessons from Drosophila Research.
PG  - 497-516
AB  - The steroid hormone ecdysone is the central regulator of insect developmental
      transitions. Recent new advances in our understanding of ecdysone action have
      relied heavily on the application of Drosophila melanogaster molecular genetic
      tools to study insect metamorphosis. In this review, we focus on three major
      aspects of Drosophila ecdysone biology: (a) factors that regulate the timing of
      ecdysone release, (b) molecular basis of stage- and tissue-specific responses to 
      ecdysone, and (c) feedback regulation and coordination of ecdysone signaling.

TI  - Stem Cell-based Tissue Engineering Approaches for Musculoskeletal Regeneration.
PG  - 3429-45
AB  - The field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering is an ever evolving
      field that holds promise in treating numerous musculoskeletal diseases and
      injuries. An important impetus in the development of the field was the discovery 
      and implementation of stem cells. The utilization of mesenchymal stem cells, and 
      later embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, opens new arenas for tissue
      engineering and presents the potential of developing stem cell-based therapies
      for disease treatment. Multipotent and pluripotent stem cells can produce various
      lineage tissues, and allow for derivation of a tissue that may be comprised of
      multiple cell types. As the field grows, the combination of biomaterial scaffolds
      and bioreactors provides methods to create an environment for stem cells that
      better represent their microenvironment for new tissue formation. As technologies
      for the fabrication of biomaterial scaffolds advance, the ability of scaffolds to
      modulate stem cell behavior advances as well. The composition of scaffolds could 
      be of natural or synthetic materials and could be tailored to enhance cell
      self-renewal and/or direct cell fates. In addition to biomaterial scaffolds,
      studies of tissue development and cellular microenvironments have determined
      other factors, such as growth factors and oxygen tension, that are crucial to the
      regulation of stem cell activity. The overarching goal of stem cell-based tissue 
      engineering research is to precisely control differentiation of stem cells in
      culture. In this article, we review current developments in tissue engineering,
      focusing on several stem cell sources, induction factors including growth
      factors, oxygen tension, biomaterials, and mechanical stimulation, and the
      internal and external regulatory mechanisms that govern proliferation and
      differentiation.

TI  - Developmental Checkpoints and Feedback Circuits Time Insect Maturation.
PG  - 1-33
AB  - The transition from juvenile to adult is a fundamental process that allows
      animals to allocate resource toward reproduction after completing a certain
      amount of growth. In insects, growth to a species-specific target size induces
      pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone that triggers metamorphosis and
      reproductive maturation. The past few years have seen significant progress in
      understanding the interplay of mechanisms that coordinate timing of ecdysone
      production and release. These studies show that the neuroendocrine system
      monitors complex size-related and nutritional signals, as well as external cues, 
      to time production and release of ecdysone. Based on results discussed here, we
      suggest that developmental progression to adulthood is controlled by checkpoints 
      that regulate the genetic timing program enabling it to adapt to different
      environmental conditions. These checkpoints utilize a number of signaling
      pathways to modulate ecdysone production in the prothoracic gland. Release of
      ecdysone activates an autonomous cascade of both feedforward and feedback signals
      that determine the duration of the ecdysone pulse at each developmental
      transitions. Conservation of the genetic mechanisms that coordinate the
      juvenile-adult transition suggests that insights from the fruit fly Drosophila
      will provide a framework for future investigation of developmental timing in
      metazoans.

TI  - Radiation Survivors: Understanding and exploiting the phenotype following
      fractionated radiation therapy.
PG  - 5-12
AB  - Radiation oncology modalities such as intensity-modulated and image-guided
      radiation therapy can reduce the high dose to normal tissue and deliver a
      heterogeneous dose to tumors focusing on areas deemed at highest risk for tumor
      persistence. Clinical radiation oncology produces daily doses ranging from 1 to
      20 Gy, with tissues being exposed to 30 or more daily fractions. Hypothesizing
      that cells that survive fractionated radiation therapy have a substantially
      different phenotype than the untreated cells, which might be exploitable for
      targeting with molecular therapeutics or immunotherapy, three prostate cancer
      cell lines (PC3, DU145 and LNCaP) and normal endothelial cells were studied to
      understand the biology of differential effects of multi-fraction (MF) radiation
      of 0.5, 1 and/or 2 Gy fraction to 10 Gy total dose, and a single dose (SD) of 5
      and 10 Gy. The resulting changes in mRNA, miRNA and phosphoproteome were
      analyzed. Significant differences were observed in the MF radiation exposures
      including those from the 0.5 Gy MF that produces little cell killing. As
      expected, p53 function played a major role in response. Pathways modified by MF
      include immune response, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, TGF-β, survival and
      apoptotic signal transduction. The radiation-induced stress response will
      set-forth a unique platform for exploiting the effects of radiation therapy as
      “focused biology” for cancer treatment in conjunction with molecular targeted or 
      immunologically directed therapy. Given that more normal tissue is treated,
      albeit to lower doses with these newer techniques, the response of the normal
      tissue may also influence long-term treatment outcome.

TI  - Quantitative Proteomics with siRNA Screening Identifies Novel Mechanisms of
      Trastuzumab Resistance in HER2 Amplified Breast Cancers*.
PG  - 180-93
AB  - HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in 20% to 30% of human
      breast cancers and which affects patient prognosis and survival. Treatment of
      HER2-positive breast cancer with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) 
      has improved patient survival, but the development of trastuzumab resistance is a
      major medical problem. Many of the known mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance
      cause changes in protein phosphorylation patterns, and therefore quantitative
      proteomics was used to examine phosphotyrosine signaling networks in
      trastuzumab-resistant cells. The model system used in this study was two pairs of
      trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cell lines. Using stable
      isotope labeling, phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations, and online TiO2
      chromatography utilizing a dual trap configuration, ∼1700 proteins were
      quantified. Comparing quantified proteins between the two cell line pairs showed 
      only a small number of common protein ratio changes, demonstrating heterogeneity 
      in phosphotyrosine signaling networks across different trastuzumab-resistant
      cancers. Proteins showing significant increases in resistant versus sensitive
      cells were subjected to a focused siRNA screen to evaluate their functional
      relevance to trastuzumab resistance. The screen revealed proteins related to the 
      Src kinase pathway, such as CDCP1/Trask, embryonal Fyn substrate, and Paxillin.
      We also identify several novel proteins that increased trastuzumab sensitivity in
      resistant cells when targeted by siRNAs, including FAM83A and MAPK1. These
      proteins may present targets for the development of clinical diagnostics or
      therapeutic strategies to guide the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer patients who
      develop trastuzumab resistance.

      repair, damage signaling and other noncanonical activities.
PG  - 53-66
AB  - The field of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) has rapidly expanded after the discovery
      of the MutHLS repair system in bacteria. By the mid 1990s yeast and human
      homologues to bacterial MutL and MutS had been identified and their contribution 
      to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; Lynch Syndrome) was under
      intense investigation. The human MutS homologue 6 protein (hMSH6), was first
      reported in 1995 as a G:T binding partner (GTBP) of hMSH2, forming the hMutSα
      mismatch-binding complex. Signal transduction from each DNA-bound hMutSα complex 
      is accomplished by the hMutLα heterodimer (hMLH1 and hPMS2). Molecular mechanisms
      and cellular regulation of individual MMR proteins are now areas of intensive
      research. This review will focus on molecular mechanisms associated with mismatch
      binding, as well as emerging evidence that MutSα and in particular, MSH6, is a
      key protein in MMR-dependent DNA damage response and communication with other DNA
      repair pathways within the cell. MSH6 is unstable in the absence of MSH2, however
      it is the DNA lesion-binding partner of this heterodimer. MSH6, but not MSH2, has
      a conserved Phe-X-Glu motif that recognizes and binds several different DNA
      structural distortions, initiating different cellular responses. hMSH6 also
      contains the nuclear localization sequences required to shuttle hMutSα into the
      nucleus. For example, upon binding to O6meG:T, MSH6 triggers a DNA damage
      response that involves altered phosphorylation within the N-terminal disordered
      domain of this unique protein. While many investigations have focused on MMR as a
      post-replication DNA repair mechanism, MMR proteins are expressed and active in
      all phases of the cell cycle. There is much more to be discovered about
      regulatory cellular roles that require the presence of MutSα and, in particular, 
      MSH6.

      data.
PG  - 2617
AB  - Global ‘multi-omics’ profiling of cancer cells harbours the potential for
      characterizing the signaling networks associated with specific oncogenes. Here we
      profile the transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome in a panel of non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines in order to reconstruct targetable networks
      associated with KRAS dependency. We develop a two-step bioinformatics strategy
      addressing the challenge of integrating these disparate data sets. We first
      define an ‘abundance-score’ combining transcript, protein and phospho-protein
      abundances to nominate differentially abundant proteins and then use the Prize
      Collecting Steiner Tree algorithm to identify functional sub-networks. We
      identify three modules centered on KRAS and MET, LCK and PAK1 and b-Catenin. We
      validate activation of these proteins in KRAS-dependent (KRAS-Dep) cells and
      perform functional studies defining LCK as a critical gene for cell proliferation
      in KRAS-Dep but not KRAS-independent NSCLCs. These results suggest that LCK is a 
      potential druggable target protein in KRAS-Dep lung cancers.

TI  - Analysis of SRC Oncogenic Signaling in Colorectal Cancer by Stable Isotope
      Labeling with Heavy Amino Acids in Mouse Xenografts*.
PG  - 1937-50
AB  - The non-receptor tyrosine kinase SRC is frequently deregulated in human
      colorectal cancer (CRC), and SRC increased activity has been associated with poor
      clinical outcomes. In nude mice engrafted with human CRC cells, SRC
      over-expression favors tumor growth and is accompanied by a robust increase in
      tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cells. How SRC contributes to this tumorigenic 
      process is largely unknown. We analyzed SRC oncogenic signaling in these tumors
      by means of a novel quantitative proteomic analysis. This method is based on
      stable isotope labeling with amino acids of xenograft tumors by the addition of
      [13C6]-lysine into mouse food. An incorporation level greater than 88% was
      obtained in xenograft tumors after 30 days of the heavy lysine diet. Quantitative
      phosphoproteomic analysis of these tumors allowed the identification of 61
      proteins that exhibited a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and/or
      association with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins upon SRC expression. These
      mainly included molecules implicated in vesicular trafficking and signaling and
      RNA binding proteins. Most of these proteins were specific targets of SRC
      signaling in vivo, as they were not identified by analysis via stable isotope
      labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) of the same CRC cells in culture.
      This suggests that oncogenic signaling induced by SRC in tumors significantly
      differs from that induced by SRC in cell culture. We next confirmed this notion
      experimentally with the example of the vesicular trafficking protein and SRC
      substrate TOM1L1. We found that whereas TOM1L1 depletion only slightly affected
      SRC-induced proliferation of CRC cells in vitro, it drastically decreased tumor
      growth in xenografted nude mice. We thus concluded that this vesicular
      trafficking protein plays an important role in SRC-induced tumor growth. Overall,
      these data show that SILAC analysis in mouse xenografts is a valuable approach
      for deciphering tyrosine kinase oncogenic signaling in vivo.

TI  - Phosphoproteome of Pristionchus pacificus Provides Insights into Architecture of 
      Signaling Networks in Nematode Models*.
PG  - 1631-9
AB  - Pristionchus pacificus is a nematode that is increasingly used as a model
      organism in evolutionary biology. The genome of P. pacificus differs markedly
      from that of C. elegans, with a high number of orphan genes that are restricted
      to P. pacificus and have no homologs in other species. To gain insight into the
      architecture of signal transduction networks in model nematodes, we performed a
      large-scale qualitative phosphoproteome analysis of P. pacificus. Using two-stage
      enrichment of phosphopeptides from a digest of P. pacificus proteins and their
      subsequent analysis via high accuracy MS, we detected and localized 6,809
      phosphorylation events on 2,508 proteins. We compared the detected P. pacificus
      phosphoproteome to the recently published phosphoproteome of C. elegans. The
      overall numbers and functional classes of phosphoproteins were similar between
      the two organisms. Interestingly, the products of orphan genes were significantly
      underrepresented among the detected P. pacificus phosphoproteins. We defined the 
      theoretical kinome of P. pacificus and compared it to that of C. elegans. While
      tyrosine kinases were slightly underrepresented in the kinome of P. pacificus,
      all major classes of kinases were present in both organisms. Application of our
      kinome annotation to a recent transcriptomic study of dauer and mixed stage
      populations showed that Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases show similar expression levels in
      P. pacificus but not in C. elegans. This study presents the first systematic
      comparison of phosphoproteomes and kinomes of two model nematodes and, as such,
      will be a useful resource for comparative studies of their signal transduction
      networks.

TI  - Quantitative phosphoproteomics in nuclei of vasopressin-sensitive renal
      collecting duct cells.
PG  - C1006-20
AB  - Vasopressin regulates transport across the collecting duct epithelium in part via
      effects on gene transcription. Transcriptional regulation occurs partially via
      changes in phosphorylation of transcription factors, transcriptional
      coactivators, and protein kinases in the nucleus. To test whether vasopressin
      alters the nuclear phosphoproteome of vasopressin-sensitive cultured mouse mpkCCD
      cells, we used stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to quantify
      thousands of phosphorylation sites in nuclear extracts and nuclear pellet
      fractions. Measurements were made in the presence and absence of the vasopressin 
      analog dDAVP. Of the 1,251 sites quantified, 39 changed significantly in response
      to dDAVP. Network analysis of the regulated proteins revealed two major clusters 
      (“cell-cell adhesion” and “transcriptional regulation”) that were connected to
      known elements of the vasopressin signaling pathway. The hub proteins for these
      two clusters were the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin and the transcription
      factor c-Jun. Phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser552 was increased by dDAVP
      [log2(dDAVP/vehicle) = 1.79], and phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser73 was decreased
      [log2(dDAVP/vehicle) = −0.53]. The β-catenin site is known to be targeted by
      either protein kinase A or Akt, both of which are activated in response to
      vasopressin. The c-Jun site is a canonical target for the MAP kinase Jnk2, which 
      is downregulated in response to vasopressin in the collecting duct. The data
      support the idea that vasopressin-mediated control of transcription in collecting
      duct cells involves selective changes in the nuclear phosphoproteome. All data
      are available to users at http://helixweb.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/mNPPD/.

TI  - Multiscale Models of Cell Signaling.
PG  - 2319-27
AB  - Computational models of signal transduction face challenges of scale below the
      resolution of a single cell. Here, we organize these challenges around three key 
      interfaces for multiscale models of cell signaling: molecules to pathways,
      pathways to networks, and networks to outcomes. Each interface requires its own
      set of computational approaches and systems-level data, and no single approach or
      dataset can effectively bridge all three interfaces. This suggests that realistic
      “whole-cell” models of signaling will need to agglomerate different model types
      that span critical intracellular scales. Future multiscale models will be
      valuable for understanding the impact of signaling mutations or population
      variants that lead to cellular diseases such as cancer.

TI  - Posttranslational Modifications of the Retinoblastoma Tumor Suppressor Protein as
      Determinants of Function.
PG  - 619-33
AB  - The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) plays an integral role in G1-S 
      checkpoint control and consequently is a frequent target for inactivation in
      cancer. The RB protein can function as an adaptor, nucleating components such as 
      E2Fs and chromatin regulating enzymes into the same complex. For this reason,
      pRB’s regulation by posttranslational modifications is thought to be critical.
      pRB is phosphorylated by a number of different kinases such as cyclin dependent
      kinases (Cdks), p38 MAP kinase, Chk1/2, Abl, and Aurora b. Although
      phosphorylation of pRB by Cdks has been extensively studied, activities regulated
      through phosphorylation by other kinases are just starting to be understood. As
      well as being phosphorylated, pRB is acetylated, methylated, ubiquitylated, and
      SUMOylated. Acetylation, methylation, and SUMOylation play roles in pRB mediated 
      gene silencing. Ubiquitinylation of pRB promotes its degradation and may be used 
      to regulate apoptosis. Recent proteomic data have revealed that pRB is
      posttranslationally modified to a much greater extent than previously thought.
      This new information suggests that many unknown pathways affect pRB regulation.
      This review focuses on posttranslational modifications of pRB and how they
      influence its function. The final part of the review summarizes new
      phosphorylation sites from accumulated proteomic data and discusses the
      possibilities that might arise from this data.

TI  - Flipping the Switch from G1 to S Phase with E3 Ubiquitin Ligases.
PG  - 634-48
AB  - The cell cycle ensures genome maintenance by coordinating the processes of DNA
      replication and chromosome segregation. Of particular importance is the
      irreversible transition from the G1 phase of the cell cycle to S phase. This
      transition marks the switch from preparing chromosomes for replication (“origin
      licensing”) to active DNA synthesis (“origin firing”). Ubiquitin-mediated
      proteolysis is essential for restricting DNA replication to only once per cell
      cycle and is the major mechanism regulating the G1 to S phase transition.
      Although some changes in protein levels are attributable to regulated mRNA
      abundance, protein degradation elicits very rapid changes in protein abundance
      and is critical for the sharp and irreversible transition from one cell cycle
      stage to the next. Not surprisingly, regulation of the G1-to-S phase transition
      is perturbed in most cancer cells, and deregulation of key molecular events in G1
      and S phase drives not only cell proliferation but also genome instability. In
      this review we focus on the mechanisms by which E3 ubiquitin ligases control the 
      irreversible transition from G1 to S phase in mammalian cells.

TI  - Phosphorylation of the Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4E-Transporter
      (4E-T) by c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase Promotes Stress-Dependent P-Body Assembly.
PG  - 4572-84
AB  - Processing bodies (PBs, or P bodies) are cytoplasmic granules involved in mRNA
      storage and degradation that participate in the regulation of gene expression.
      PBs concentrate nontranslated mRNAs and several factors involved in mRNA decay
      and translational repression, including the eukaryotic translation initiation
      factor 4E-transporter (4E-T). 4E-T is required for PB assembly, but little is
      known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate its function. Here, we
      demonstrate that oxidative stress promotes multisite 4E-T phosphorylation. We
      show that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is targeted to PBs in response to
      oxidative stress and promotes the phosphorylation of 4E-T. Quantitative mass
      spectrometry analysis reveals that JNK phosphorylates 4E-T on six
      proline-directed sites that are required for the formation of the 4E-T complex
      upon stress. We have developed an image-based computational method to quantify
      the size, number, and density of PBs in cells, and we find that while 4E-T is
      required for steady-state PB assembly, its phosphorylation facilitates the
      formation of larger PBs upon oxidative stress. Using polysomal mRNA profiling, we
      assessed global and specific mRNA translation but did not find that 4E-T
      phosphorylation impacts translational control. Collectively, these data support a
      model whereby PB assembly is regulated by a two-step mechanism involving a
      4E-T-dependent assembly stage in unstressed cells and a 4E-T
      phosphorylation-dependent aggregation stage in response to stress stimuli.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Soybean Root Hairs Inoculated with
      Bradyrhizobium japonicum*.
PG  - 1140-55
AB  - Root hairs are single hair-forming cells on roots that function to increase root 
      surface area, enhancing water and nutrient uptake. In leguminous plants, root
      hairs also play a critical role as the site of infection by symbiotic nitrogen
      fixing rhizobia, leading to the formation of a novel organ, the nodule. The
      initial steps in the rhizobia-root hair infection process are known to involve
      specific receptor kinases and subsequent kinase cascades. Here, we characterize
      the phosphoproteome of the root hairs and the corresponding stripped roots (i.e. 
      roots from which root hairs were removed) during rhizobial colonization and
      infection to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of root hair cell biology.
      We chose soybean (Glycine max L.), one of the most important crop plants in the
      legume family, for this study because of its larger root size, which permits
      isolation of sufficient root hair material for phosphoproteomic analysis.
      Phosphopeptides derived from root hairs and stripped roots, mock inoculated or
      inoculated with the soybean-specific rhizobium Bradyrhizobium japonicum, were
      labeled with the isobaric tag eight-plex iTRAQ, enriched using Ni-NTA magnetic
      beads and subjected to nanoRPLC-MS/MS1 analysis using HCD and decision tree
      guided CID/ETD strategy. A total of 1625 unique phosphopeptides, spanning 1659
      nonredundant phosphorylation sites, were detected from 1126 soybean
      phosphoproteins. Among them, 273 phosphopeptides corresponding to 240
      phosphoproteins were found to be significantly regulated (>1.5-fold abundance
      change) in response to inoculation with B. japonicum. The data reveal unique
      features of the soybean root hair phosphoproteome, including root hair and
      stripped root-specific phosphorylation suggesting a complex network of
      kinase-substrate and phosphatase-substrate interactions in response to rhizobial 
      inoculation.

TI  - Modified SH2 domain to phototrap and identify phosphotyrosine proteins from
      subcellular sites within cells.
PG  - E2929-38
AB  - Spatial regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation is important for many aspects of
      cell biology. However, phosphotyrosine accounts for less than 1% of all
      phosphorylated substrates, and it is typically a very transient event in vivo.
      These factors complicate the identification of key tyrosine kinase substrates,
      especially in the context of their extraordinary spatial organization. Here, we
      describe an approach to identify tyrosine kinase substrates based on their
      subcellular distribution from within cells. This method uses an unnatural amino
      acid-modified Src homology 2 (SH2) domain that is expressed within cells and can 
      covalently trap phosphotyrosine proteins on exposure to light. This SH2
      domain-based photoprobe was targeted to cellular structures, such as the actin
      cytoskeleton, mitochondria, and cellular membranes, to capture tyrosine kinase
      substrates unique to each cellular region. We demonstrate that RhoA, one of the
      proteins associated with actin, can be phosphorylated on two tyrosine residues
      within the switch regions, suggesting that phosphorylation of these residues
      might modulate RhoA signaling to the actin cytoskeleton. We conclude that
      expression of SH2 domains within cellular compartments that are capable of
      covalent phototrapping can reveal the spatial organization of tyrosine kinase
      substrates that are likely to be important for the regulation of subcellular
      structures.

      Molecular Targets, and Therapeutic Promise.
PG  - 2036-53
AB  - All cells have developed various mechanisms to respond and adapt to a variety of 
      environmental challenges, including stresses that damage cellular proteins. One
      such response, the heat shock response (HSR), leads to the transcriptional
      activation of a family of molecular chaperone proteins that promote proper
      folding or clearance of damaged proteins within the cytosol. In addition to its
      role in protection against acute insults, the HSR also regulates lifespan and
      protects against protein misfolding that is associated with degenerative diseases
      of aging. As a result, identifying pharmacological regulators of the HSR has
      become an active area of research in recent years. Here, we review progress made 
      in identifying small molecule activators of the HSR, what cellular targets these 
      compounds interact with to drive response activation, and how such molecules may 
      ultimately be employed to delay or reverse protein misfolding events that
      contribute to a number of diseases.

      platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic
      mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at > 10%
      incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous
      subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific 
      mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the Luminal A subtype. We identified
      two novel protein expression-defined subgroups, possibly contributed by
      stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific 
      signaling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a
      HER2/p-HER2/HER1/p-HER1 signature within the HER2-Enriched expression subtype.
      Comparison of Basal-like breast tumors with high-grade Serous Ovarian tumors
      showed many molecular commonalities, suggesting a related etiology and similar
      therapeutic opportunities. The biologic finding of the four main breast cancer
      subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities
      raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and
      heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biologic subtypes of
      breast cancer.

PG  - 16190-5
AB  - Hypothesis directed proteomics offers higher throughput over global analyses. We 
      show that immunoprecipitation (IP)–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in H929
      multiple myeloma (MM) cancer cells led to the discovery of a rare and unexpected 
      BCR–ABL fusion, informing a therapeutic intervention using imatinib (Gleevec).
      BCR–ABL is the driving mutation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is uncommon
      to other cancers. Three different IP–MS experiments central to cell signaling
      pathways were sufficient to discover a BCR–ABL fusion in H929 cells:
      phosphotyrosine (pY) peptide IP, p85 regulatory subunit of
      phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) IP, and the GRB2 adaptor IP. The pY peptides
      inform tyrosine kinase activity, p85 IP informs the activating adaptors and
      receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) involved in AKT activation and GRB2 IP
      identifies RTKs and adaptors leading to ERK activation. Integration of the
      bait–prey data from the three separate experiments identified the BCR–ABL protein
      complex, which was confirmed by biochemistry, cytogenetic methods, and DNA
      sequencing revealed the e14a2 fusion transcript. The tyrosine phosphatase SHP2
      and the GAB2 adaptor protein, important for MAPK signaling, were common to all
      three IP–MS experiments. The comparative treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      (TKI) drugs revealed only imatinib, the standard of care in CML, was inhibitory
      to BCR–ABL leading to down-regulation of pERK and pS6K and inhibiting cell
      proliferation. These data suggest a model for directed proteomics from patient
      tumor samples for selecting the appropriate TKI drug(s) based on IP and LC-MS/MS.
      The data also suggest that MM patients, in addition to CML patients, may benefit 
      from BCR–ABL diagnostic screening.

PG  - 3559-67
AB  - TLRs are a family of pattern recognition receptors that recognize conserved
      molecular structures/products from a wide variety of microbes. Following
      recognition of ligands, TLRs recruit signaling adapters to initiate a
      pro-inflammatory signaling cascade culminating in the activation of several
      transcription factor families. Additionally, TLR signals lead to activation of
      PI3K, affecting many aspects of the cellular response, including cell survival,
      proliferation and regulation of the pro-inflammatory response. The recent
      discovery of BCAP as a TLR signaling adaptor, crucial for linking TLRs to PI3K
      activation, allows new questions of the importance of PI3K activation downstream 
      of TLRs. Here, we summarize the current understanding of signaling pathways
      activated by TLRs and provide our perspective on TLR mediated activation of PI3K 
      and its impact on regulating cellular processes.

PG  - 686-99
AB  - Mitotic exit and cell division must be spatially and temporally integrated to
      facilitate equal division of genetic material between daughter cells. In the
      fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a spindle pole body (SPB) localized
      signaling cascade termed the septation initiation network (SIN) couples mitotic
      exit with cytokinesis. The SIN is controlled at many levels to ensure that
      cytokinesis is executed once per cell cycle and only after cells segregate their 
      DNA. An interesting facet of the SIN is that its activity is asymmetric on the
      two SPBs during anaphase; however, how and why the SIN is asymmetric has remained
      elusive. Many key factors controlling SIN asymmetry have now been identified,
      shedding light on the significance of SIN asymmetry in regulating cytokinesis. In
      this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of SIN regulation,
      with an emphasis on how SIN asymmetry is achieved and how this aspect of SIN
      regulation fine-tunes cytokinesis.

      KRAS-activated Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells*.
PG  - 901-15
AB  - Mutational activation of KRAS promotes various malignancies, including lung
      adenocarcinoma. Knowledge of the molecular targets mediating the downstream
      effects of activated KRAS is limited. Here, we provide the KRAS target proteins
      and N-glycoproteins using human bronchial epithelial cells with and without the
      expression of activated KRAS (KRASV12). Using an OFFGEL peptide fractionation and
      hydrazide method combined with subsequent LTQ-Orbitrap analysis, we identified
      5713 proteins and 608 N-glycosites on 317 proteins in human bronchial epithelial 
      cells. Label-free quantitation of 3058 proteins (≥2 peptides; coefficient of
      variation (CV) ≤ 20%) and 297 N-glycoproteins (CV ≤ 20%) revealed the
      differential regulation of 23 proteins and 14 N-glycoproteins caused by activated
      KRAS, including 84% novel ones. An informatics-assisted IPA-Biomarker® filter
      analysis prioritized some of the differentially regulated proteins (ALDH3A1, CA2,
      CTSD, DST, EPHA2, and VIM) and N-glycoproteins (ALCAM, ITGA3, and TIMP-1) as
      cancer biomarkers. Further, integrated in silico analysis of microarray
      repository data of lung adenocarcinoma clinical samples and cell lines containing
      KRAS mutations showed positive mRNA fold changes (p < 0.05) for 61% of the
      KRAS-regulated proteins, including biomarker proteins, CA2 and CTSD. The most
      significant discovery of the integrated validation is the down-regulation of
      FABP5 and PDCD4. A few validated proteins, including tumor suppressor PDCD4, were
      further confirmed as KRAS targets by shRNA-based knockdown experiments. Finally, 
      the studies on KRAS-regulated N-glycoproteins revealed structural alterations in 
      the core N-glycans of SEMA4B in KRAS-activated human bronchial epithelial cells
      and functional role of N-glycosylation of TIMP-1 in the regulation of lung
      adenocarcinoma A549 cell invasion. Together, our study represents the largest
      proteome and N-glycoproteome data sets for HBECs, which we used to identify
      several novel potential targets of activated KRAS that may provide insights into 
      KRAS-induced adenocarcinoma and have implications for both lung cancer therapy
      and diagnosis.

TI  - Exosomes as Biomarker Enriched Microvesicles: Characterization of Exosomal
      Proteins Derived from a Panel of Prostate Cell Lines with Distinct AR Phenotypes.
PG  - 863-85
AB  - Prostate cancer is the leading type of cancer diagnosed in men. In 2010, ∼217,730
      new cases of prostate cancer were reported in the United States. Prompt diagnosis
      of the disease can substantially improve its clinical outcome. Improving
      capability for early detection, as well as developing new therapeutic targets in 
      advanced disease are research priorities that will ultimately lead to better
      patient survival. Eukaryotic cells secrete proteins via distinct regulated
      mechanisms which are either ER/Golgi dependent or microvesicle mediated. The
      release of microvesicles has been shown to provide a novel mechanism for
      intercellular communication. Exosomes are nanometer sized cup-shaped membrane
      vesicles which are secreted from normal and cancerous cells. They are present in 
      various biological fluids and are rich in characteristic proteins. Exosomes may
      thus have potential both in facilitating early diagnosis via less invasive
      procedures or be candidates for novel therapeutic approaches for castration
      resistance prostate cancer. Because exosomes have been shown previously to have a
      role in cell-cell communication in the local tumor microenvironment, conferring
      activation of numerous survival mechanisms, we characterized constitutive lipids,
      cholesterol and proteins from exosomes derived from six prostate cell lines and
      tracked their uptake in both cancerous and benign prostate cell lines
      respectively. Our comprehensive proteomic and lipidomic analysis of prostate
      derived exosomes could provide insight for future work on both biomarker and
      therapeutic targets for the treatment of prostate cancer.

TI  - Quantitative- and Phospho-Proteomic Analysis of the Yeast Response to the
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Imatinib to Pharmacoproteomics-Guided Drug Line
      Extension.
PG  - 537-51
AB  - Imatinib mesylate (IM) is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as front-line
      therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia, a disease caused by the oncogenic kinase
      Bcr-Abl. Although the clinical success of IM set a new paradigm in
      molecular-targeted therapy, the emergence of IM resistance is a clinically
      significant problem. In an effort to obtain new insights into the mechanisms of
      adaptation and tolerance to IM, as well as the signaling pathways potentially
      affected by this drug, we performed a two-dimensional electrophoresis-based
      quantitative- and phospho-proteomic analysis in the eukaryotic model
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We singled out proteins that were either differentially
      expressed or differentially phosphorylated in response to IM, using the
      phosphoselective dye Pro-Q® Diamond, and identified 18 proteins in total. Ten
      were altered only at the content level (mostly decreased), while the remaining 8 
      possessed IM-repressed phosphorylation. These 18 proteins are mainly involved in 
      cellular carbohydrate processes (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis), translation,
      protein folding, ion homeostasis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism.
      Remarkably, all 18 proteins have human functional homologs. A role for HSP70
      proteins in the response to IM, as well as decreased glycolysis as a metabolic
      marker of IM action are suggested, consistent with findings from studies in human
      cell lines. The previously-proposed effect of IM as an inhibitor of vacuolar
      H+-ATPase function was supported by the identification of an underexpressed
      protein subunit of this complex. Taken together, these findings reinforce the
      role of yeast as a valuable eukaryotic model for pharmacological studies and
      identification of new drug targets, with potential clinical implications in drug 
      reassignment or line extension under a personalized medicine perspective.

TI  - An evolutionary perspective on the kinome of malaria parasites.
PG  - 2607-18
AB  - Malaria parasites belong to an ancient lineage that diverged very early from the 
      main branch of eukaryotes. The approximately 90-member plasmodial kinome includes
      a majority of eukaryotic protein kinases that clearly cluster within the AGC,
      CMGC, TKL, CaMK and CK1 groups found in yeast, plants and mammals, testifying to 
      the ancient ancestry of these families. However, several hundred millions years
      of independent evolution, and the specific pressures brought about by first a
      photosynthetic and then a parasitic lifestyle, led to the emergence of unique
      features in the plasmodial kinome. These include taxon-restricted kinase
      families, and unique peculiarities of individual enzymes even when they have
      homologues in other eukaryotes. Here, we merge essential aspects of all three
      malaria-related communications that were presented at the Evolution of Protein
      Phosphorylation meeting, and propose an integrated discussion of the specific
      features of the parasite's kinome and phosphoproteome.

TI  - Perifosine enhances mTORC1-targeted cancer therapy by activation of GSK3β in
      NSCLC cells.
PG  - 1009-17
AB  - mTORC1 inhibitors, including rapamycin and its analogs, have been actively
      studied both pre-clinically and clinically. However, the single treatment of
      mTORC1 inhibitors has been modest in most cancer types. We have previously
      demonstrated that the activation of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling pathways
      attenuates the anticancer efficacy of mTORC1 inhibitors. In this study, we report
      that mTORC1 inhibition also phosphorylates and inactivates GSK3β, which is a
      tumor suppressor in lung cancer. Moreover, we show that perifosine, as an Akt
      inhibitor, decreases rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β and elevated
      p-GSK3β levels in rapamycin-resistant cell lines. Combination of perifosine with 
      mTORC1 inhibitors showed enhanced anticancer efficacy both in cell cultures and
      in a xenograft mouse model. In addition, perifosine inhibits the growth of both
      rapamycin sensitive and resistant A549 cells. However, inhibition of GSK3β by a
      selective inhibitor- LiCl, or downregulation of GSK3β expression by siRNA,
      reverses the growth inhibitory effects of perifosine on rapamycin resistant
      cells, suggesting the important role of GSK3β activation in enhancing mTORC1
      inhibitors efficacy by perifosine. Thus, our results provide a potential
      therapeutic strategy to enhance mTORC1-targeted cancer therapy by using
      perifosine or targeting GSK3β.

TI  - Model systems for studying trophoblast differentiation from human pluripotent
      stem cells.
PG  - 809-24
AB  - This review focuses on a now well-established model for generating cells of the
      trophoblast (TB) lineage by treating human embryonic stem cells (ESC) and induced
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with the growth factor BMP4. We first discuss the
      opposing roles of FGF2 and BMP4 in directing TB formation and the need to exclude
      the former from the growth medium to minimize the co-induction of mesoderm and
      endoderm. Under these conditions, there is up-regulation of several transcription
      factors implicated in TB lineage emergence within 3 h of BMP4 exposure and, over 
      a period of days and especially under a high O2 gas atmosphere, gradual
      appearance of cell types carrying markers for more differentiated TB cell types, 
      including extravillous TB and syncytioTB. We describe the potential value of
      including low molecular weight pharmaceutical agents that block activin A (INHBA)
      and FGF2 signaling to support BMP4-directed differentiation. We contend that the 
      weight of available evidence supports the contention that BMP4 converts human ESC
      and iPSC of the so-called epiblast type unidirectionally to TB. We also consider 
      the argument that BMP4 treatment of human ESC in the absence of exogenous FGF2
      leads only to the emergence of mesoderm derivatives to be seriously flawed.
      Instead, we propose that, when signaling networks supporting pluripotency ESC or 
      iPSC become unsustainable and when specification towards extra-embryonic mesoderm
      and endoderm are rendered inoperative, TB emerges as a major default state to
      pluripotency.

TI  - Phosphosignature Predicts Dasatinib Response in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer*.
PG  - 651-68
AB  - Targeted drugs are less toxic than traditional chemotherapeutic therapies;
      however, the proportion of patients that benefit from these drugs is often
      smaller. A marker that confidently predicts patient response to a specific
      therapy would allow an individual therapy selection most likely to benefit the
      patient. Here, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to globally profile the
      basal phosphoproteome of a panel of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. The
      effect of the kinase inhibitor dasatinib on cellular growth was tested against
      the same panel. From the phosphoproteome profiles, we identified 58
      phosphorylation sites, which consistently differ between sensitive and resistant 
      cell lines. Many of the corresponding proteins are involved in cell adhesion and 
      cytoskeleton organization. We showed that a signature of only 12 phosphorylation 
      sites is sufficient to accurately predict dasatinib sensitivity. Four of the
      phosphorylation sites belong to integrin β4, a protein that mediates cell-matrix 
      or cell-cell adhesion. The signature was validated in cross-validation and label 
      switch experiments and in six independently profiled breast cancer cell lines.
      The study supports that the phosphorylation of integrin β4, as well as eight
      further proteins comprising the signature, are candidate biomarkers for
      predicting response to dasatinib in solid tumors. Furthermore, our results show
      that identifying predictive phosphorylation signatures from global, quantitative 
      phosphoproteomic data is possible and can open a new path to discovering
      molecular markers for response prediction.

TI  - Fast rebinding increases dwell time of Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing proteins
      near the plasma membrane.
PG  - 14024-9
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) control a host of biological functions by
      phosphorylating tyrosine residues of intracellular proteins upon extracellular
      ligand binding. The phosphotyrosines (p-Tyr) then recruit a subset of ∼100 Src
      homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins to the cell membrane. The in vivo
      kinetics of this process are not well understood. Here we use total internal
      reflection (TIR) microscopy and single-molecule imaging to monitor interactions
      between SH2 modules and p-Tyr sites near the cell membrane. We found that the
      dwell time of SH2 modules within the TIR illumination field is significantly
      longer than predictions based on chemical dissociation rate constants, suggesting
      that SH2 modules quickly rebind to nearby p-Tyr sites after dissociation. We also
      found that, consistent with the rebinding model, the effective diffusion constant
      is negatively correlated with the respective dwell time for different SH2 domains
      and the dwell time is positively correlated with the local density of RTK
      phosphorylation. These results suggest a mechanism whereby signal output can be
      regulated through the spatial organization of multiple binding sites, which will 
      prompt reevaluation of many aspects of RTK signaling, such as signaling
      specificity, mechanisms of spatial control, and noise suppression.

TI  - Cell cycle regulation of Rho signaling pathways.
PG  - 3003-10
AB  - The dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and its regulation by Rho GTPases are
      essential to maintain cell shape, to allow cell motility and are also critical
      during cell cycle progression and mitosis. Rho GTPases and their effectors are
      involved in cell rounding at mitosis onset, in chromosomes alignment and are
      required for contraction of the actomyosin ring that separates daughter cells at 
      the end of mitosis. Recent studies have revealed how a number of nucleotide
      exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins regulate the activity of Rho
      GTPases during these processes. This review will focus on how the cell cycle
      machinery, in turn, regulates expression of proteins in the Rho signaling
      pathways through transcriptional activation, ubiquitylation and proteasomal
      degradation and modulates their activity through phosphorylation by mitotic
      kinases.

TI  - Human T-lymphotropic virus proteins and post-translational modification pathways.
PG  - 115-30
AB  - Cell life from the cell cycle to the signaling transduction and response to
      stimuli is finely tuned by protein post-translational modifications (PTMs). PTMs 
      alter the conformation, the stability, the localization, and hence the pattern of
      interactions of the targeted protein. Cell pathways involve the activation of
      enzymes, like kinases, ligases and transferases, that, once activated, act on
      many proteins simultaneously, altering the state of the cell and triggering the
      processes they are involved in. Viruses enter a balanced system and hijack the
      cell, exploiting the potential of PTMs either to activate viral encoded proteins 
      or to alter cellular pathways, with the ultimate consequence to perpetuate
      through their replication. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is known to
      be highly oncogenic and associates with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma,
      HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and other inflammatory 
      pathological conditions. HTLV-1 protein activity is controlled by PTMs and, in
      turn, viral activity is associated with the modulation of cellular pathways based
      on PTMs. More knowledge is acquired about the PTMs involved in the activation of 
      its proteins, like Tax, Rex, p12, p13, p30, HTLV-I basic leucine zipper factor
      and Gag. However, more has to be understood at the biochemical level in order to 
      counteract the associated fatal outcomes. This review will focus on known PTMs
      that directly modify HTLV-1 components and on enzymes whose activity is modulated
      by viral proteins.

TI  - Identification of Targets of c-Src Tyrosine Kinase by Chemical Complementation
      and Phosphoproteomics*.
PG  - 355-69
AB  - The cellular proto-oncogene c-Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in
      cell growth and cytoskeletal regulation. Despite being dysregulated in a variety 
      of human cancers, its precise functions are not fully understood. Identification 
      of the substrates of c-Src remains a major challenge, because there is no simple 
      way to directly stimulate its activity. Here we combine the chemical rescue of
      mutant c-Src and global quantitative phosphoproteomics to obtain the first high
      resolution snapshot of the range of tyrosine phosphorylation events that occur in
      the cell immediately after specific c-Src stimulation. After enrichment by
      anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we identified 29 potential novel c-Src substrate
      proteins. Tyrosine phosphopeptide mapping allowed the identification of 382
      nonredundant tyrosine phosphopeptides on 213 phosphoproteins. Stable isotope
      labeling of amino acids in cell culture-based quantitation allowed the detection 
      of 97 nonredundant tyrosine phosphopeptides whose level of phosphorylation is
      increased by c-Src. A large number of previously uncharacterized c-Src putative
      protein targets and phosphorylation sites are presented here, a majority of which
      play key roles in signaling and cytoskeletal networks, particularly in cell
      adhesion. Integrin signaling and focal adhesion kinase signaling pathway are two 
      of the most altered pathways upon c-Src activation through chemical rescue. In
      this context, our study revealed the temporal connection between c-Src activation
      and the GTPase Rap1, known to stimulate integrin-dependent adhesion. Chemical
      rescue of c-Src provided a tool to dissect the spatiotemporal mechanism of
      activation of the Rap1 guanine exchange factor, C3G, one of the identified
      potential c-Src substrates that plays a role in focal adhesion signaling. In
      addition to unveiling the role of c-Src in the cell and, specifically, in the
      Crk-C3G-Rap1 pathway, these results exemplify a strategy for obtaining a
      comprehensive understanding of the functions of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases with
      high specificity and kinetic resolution.

TI  - A Network-based Approach for Predicting Missing Pathway Interactions.
LID - e1002640
AB  - Embedded within large-scale protein interaction networks are signaling pathways
      that encode response cascades in the cell. Unfortunately, even for well-studied
      species like S. cerevisiae, only a fraction of all true protein interactions are 
      known, which makes it difficult to reason about the exact flow of signals and the
      corresponding causal relations in the network. To help address this problem, we
      introduce a framework for predicting new interactions that aid connectivity
      between upstream proteins (sources) and downstream transcription factors
      (targets) of a particular pathway. Our algorithms attempt to globally minimize
      the distance between sources and targets by finding a small set of shortcut edges
      to add to the network. Unlike existing algorithms for predicting general protein 
      interactions, by focusing on proteins involved in specific responses our approach
      homes-in on pathway-consistent interactions. We applied our method to extend
      pathways in osmotic stress response in yeast and identified several missing
      interactions, some of which are supported by published reports. We also performed
      experiments that support a novel interaction not previously reported. Our
      framework is general and may be applicable to edge prediction problems in other
      domains.

TI  - Aberrant STAT5 and PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling occurs in human CRLF2-rearranged
      B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - 833-42
AB  - Adults and children with high-risk CRLF2-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
      (ALL) respond poorly to current cytotoxic chemotherapy and suffer unacceptably
      high rates of relapse, supporting the need to use alternative therapies. CRLF2
      encodes the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor, which activates cell
      signaling in normal lymphocytes on binding its ligand, TSLP. We hypothesized that
      aberrant cell signaling occurs in CRLF2-rearranged ALL and can be targeted by
      signal transduction inhibitors of this pathway. In a large number of primary
      CRLF2-rearranged ALL samples, we observed increased basal levels of pJAK2,
      pSTAT5, and pS6. We thus characterized the biochemical sequelae of CRLF2 and JAK 
      alterations in CRLF2-rearranged ALL primary patient samples via analysis of
      TSLP-mediated signal transduction. TSLP stimulation of these leukemias further
      induced robust JAK/STAT and PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling. JAK inhibition abrogated
      phosphorylation of JAK/STAT and, surprisingly, of PI3K/mTOR pathway members,
      suggesting an interconnection between these signaling networks and providing a
      rationale for testing JAK inhibitors in clinical trials. The PI3K/mTOR pathway
      inhibitors rapamycin, PI103, and PP242 also inhibited activated signal
      transduction and translational machinery proteins of the PI3K/mTOR pathway,
      suggesting that signal transduction inhibitors targeting this pathway also may
      have therapeutic relevance for patients with CRLF2-rearranged ALL and merit
      further preclinical testing.

TI  - Identification and Validation of Inhibitor-Responsive Kinase Substrates using a
      New Paradigm to Measure Kinase-Specific Protein Phosphorylation Index.
PG  - 3637-49
AB  - Regulation of all cellular processes requires dynamic regulation of protein
      phosphorylation. We have developed an unbiased system to globally quantify the
      phosphorylation index for substrates of a specific kinase by independently
      quantifying phosphorylated and total substrate molecules in a reverse in-gel
      kinase assay. Non-phosphorylated substrate molecules are first quantified in the 
      presence and absence of a specific stimulus. Total substrate molecules are then
      measured after complete chemical de-phosphorylation, and a ratio of
      phosphorylated to total substrate is derived. To demonstrate the utility of this 
      approach, we profiled and quantified changes in phosphorylation index for Protein
      Kinase CK2 substrates that respond to a small-molecule inhibitor. A broad range
      of inhibitor-induced changes in phosphorylation was observed in cultured cells.
      Differences among substrates in the kinetics of phosphorylation change were also 
      revealed. Comparison of CK2 inhibitor-induced changes in phosphorylation in
      cultured cells and in mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo revealed
      distinct kinetic and depth-of-response profiles. This technology provides a new
      approach to facilitate functional analyses of kinase-specific phosphorylation
      events. This strategy can be used to dissect the role of phosphorylation in
      cellular events, to facilitate kinase inhibitor target validation studies, and to
      inform in vivo analyses of kinase inhibitor drug efficacy.

TI  - MEK genomics in development and disease.
PG  - 300-10
AB  - The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (the MAPK/ERK kinases; MKKs or MEKs)
      and their downstream substrates, the extracellular-regulated kinases have been
      intensively studied for their roles in development and disease. Until recently,
      it had been assumed any mutation affecting their function would have lethal
      consequences. However, the identification of MEK1 and MEK2 mutations in
      developmental syndromes as well as chemotherapy-resistant tumors, and the
      discovery of genomic variants in MEK1 and MEK2 have led to the realization the
      extent of genomic variation associated with MEKs is much greater than had been
      appreciated. In this review, we will discuss these recent advances, relating them
      to what is currently understood about the structure and function of MEKs, and
      describe how they change our understanding of the role of MEKs in development and
      disease.

TI  - The Tlo Proteins Are Stoichiometric Components of Candida albicans Mediator
      Anchored via the Med3 Subunit.
PG  - 874-84
AB  - The amplification of the TLO (for telomere-associated) genes in Candida albicans,
      compared to its less pathogenic, close relative Candida dubliniensis, suggests a 
      role in virulence. Little, however, is known about the function of the Tlo
      proteins. We have purified the Mediator coactivator complex from C. albicans
      (caMediator) and found that Tlo proteins are a stoichiometric component of
      caMediator. Many members of the Tlo family are expressed, and each is a unique
      member of caMediator. Protein expression analysis of individual Tlo proteins, as 
      well as the purification of tagged Tlo proteins, demonstrate that there is a
      large free population of Tlo proteins in addition to the Mediator-associated
      population. Coexpression and copurification of Tloα12 and caMed3 in Escherichia
      coli established a direct physical interaction between the two proteins. We have 
      also made a C. albicansmed3Δ/Δ strain and purified an intact Mediator from this
      strain. The analysis of the composition of the med3Δ Mediator shows that it lacks
      a Tlo subunit. Regarding Mediator function, the med3Δ/Δ strain serves as a
      substitute for the difficult-to-make tloΔ/Δ C. albicans strain. A potential role 
      of the TLO and MED3 genes in virulence is supported by the inability of the
      med3Δ/Δ strain to form normal germ tubes. This study of caMediator structure
      provides initial clues to the mechanism of action of the Tlo genes and a platform
      for further mechanistic studies of caMediator's involvement in gene regulatory
      patterns that underlie pathogenesis.

TI  - Peginesatide and Erythropoietin Stimulate Similar Erythropoietin
      Receptor-Mediated Signal Transduction and Gene Induction Events.
PG  - 575-87
AB  - Peginesatide is a synthetic, PEGylated, peptide-based erythropoiesis-stimulating 
      agent that is designed and engineered to stimulate specifically the
      erythropoietin receptor dimer that governs erythropoiesis. Peginesatide has a
      unique structure that consists of a synthetic peptide dimer (with no sequence
      similarity to erythropoietin) conjugated to a 40 kDa PEG moiety. Peginesatide is 
      being developed for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney
      disease in dialysis patients. To compare signaling effects of peginesatide to
      recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), dose-dependent effects on protein
      phosphorylation and gene expression were evaluated using phosphoproteomics,
      quantitative signal transduction analyses and gene profiling. Following
      stimulation with peginesatide or rHuEPO, cell lysates were prepared from UT-7/EPO
      cells. LC-MS/MS and MesoScale arrays were used to quantify phosphorylation
      events. Transcriptional changes were analyzed using microarrays and quantitative 
      RT-PCR. Peginesatide and rHuEPO were found to regulate the tyrosine
      phosphorylation of an essentially equivalent set of protein substrates, and
      modulate the expression of a similar set of target genes. Consistent with their
      roles in stimulating erythropoiesis, peginesatide and rHuEPO regulate similar
      cellular pathways.

TI  - Opportunities and Challenges for Nutritional Proteomics in Cancer Prevention12.
PG  - 1360S-9S
AB  - Knowledge gaps persist about the efficacy of cancer prevention strategies based
      on dietary food components. Adaptations to nutrient supply are executed through
      tuning of multiple protein networks that include transcription factors, histones,
      modifying enzymes, translation factors, membrane and nuclear receptors, and
      secreted proteins. However, the simultaneous quantitative and qualitative
      measurement of all proteins that regulate cancer processes is not practical using
      traditional protein methodologies. Proteomics offers an attractive opportunity to
      fill this knowledge gap and unravel the effects of dietary components on protein 
      networks that impinge on cancer. The articles presented in this supplement are
      from talks proffered in the “Nutrition Proteomics and Cancer Prevention” session 
      at the American Institute for Cancer Research Annual Research Conference on Food,
      Nutrition, Physical Activity and Cancer held in Washington, DC on October 21 and 
      22, 2010. Recent advances in MS technologies suggest that studies in nutrition
      and cancer prevention may benefit from the adoption of proteomic tools to
      elucidate the impact on biological processes that govern the transition from
      normal to malignant phenotype; to identify protein changes that determine both
      positive and negative responses to food components; to assess how protein
      networks mediate dose-, time-, and tissue-dependent responses to food components;
      and, finally, for predicting responders and nonresponders. However, both the
      limited accessibility to proteomic technologies and research funding appear to be
      hampering the routine adoption of proteomic tools in nutrition and cancer
      prevention research.

TI  - Evolution of signal multiplexing by 14-3-3-binding 2R-ohnologue protein families 
      in the vertebrates.
LID - 120103
AB  - 14-3-3 proteins regulate cellular responses to stimuli by docking onto pairs of
      phosphorylated residues on target proteins. The present study shows that the
      human 14-3-3-binding phosphoproteome is highly enriched in 2R-ohnologues, which
      are proteins in families of two to four members that were generated by two rounds
      of whole genome duplication at the origin of the vertebrates. We identify
      2R-ohnologue families whose members share a ‘lynchpin’, defined as a
      14-3-3-binding phosphosite that is conserved across members of a given family,
      and aligns with a Ser/Thr residue in pro-orthologues from the invertebrate
      chordates. For example, the human receptor expression enhancing protein (REEP)
      1–4 family has the commonest type of lynchpin motif in current datasets, with a
      phosphorylatable serine in the –2 position relative to the 14-3-3-binding
      phosphosite. In contrast, the second 14-3-3-binding sites of REEPs 1–4 differ and
      are phosphorylated by different kinases, and hence the REEPs display different
      affinities for 14-3-3 dimers. We suggest a conceptual model for intracellular
      regulation involving protein families whose evolution into signal multiplexing
      systems was facilitated by 14-3-3 dimer binding to lynchpins, which gave freedom 
      for other regulatory sites to evolve. While increased signalling complexity was
      needed for vertebrate life, these systems also generate vulnerability to genetic 
      disorders.

TI  - Global gene profiling of VCP-associated inclusion body myopathy.
PG  - 226-34
AB  - Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal 
      dementia (IBMPFD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the
      Valosin Containing Protein (VCP) gene on chromosome 9p12-13. Patients demonstrate
      limb girdle muscle weakness, which eventually progresses to involve respiratory
      muscles, and death from respiratory and cardiac failure. This is the first
      investigation to analyze key molecular mediators and signaling cascades in
      skeletal muscle causing myopathy by global gene microarray in hopes of
      understanding the dysregulated genes and molecular mechanisms underlying IBMPFD
      and the hope of finding novel therapeutic targets. We determined expression
      profiles using Human Genome Array microarray technology in Vastus lateralis
      muscles from patients and their first degree relatives. We analyzed gene
      annotations by DAVID and identified differentially dysregulated genes with roles 
      in several novel biological pathways, including regulation of actin cytoskeleton,
      ErbB signaling, cancer, in addition to regulation of autophagy, and lysosomal
      signaling, known disrupted pathways in VCP disease. In this report, we present
      data from the first global microarray analyzing IBMPFD patient muscles and
      elucidating dysregulated pathways to further understand the pathogenesis of the
      disease and discover potential therapeutics.

TI  - mTORC1 is essential for leukemia propagation but not stem cell self-renewal.
PG  - 2114-29
AB  - Although dysregulation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes leukemogenesis, how
      mTORC1 affects established leukemia is unclear. We investigated the role of
      mTORC1 in mouse hematopoiesis using a mouse model of conditional deletion of
      Raptor, an essential component of mTORC1. Raptor deficiency impaired granulocyte 
      and B cell development but did not alter survival or proliferation of
      hematopoietic progenitor cells. In a mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
      Raptor deficiency significantly suppressed leukemia progression by causing
      apoptosis of differentiated, but not undifferentiated, leukemia cells. mTORC1 did
      not control cell cycle or cell growth in undifferentiated AML cells in vivo.
      Transplantation of Raptor-deficient undifferentiated AML cells in a limiting
      dilution revealed that mTORC1 is essential for leukemia initiation. Strikingly, a
      subset of AML cells with undifferentiated phenotypes survived long-term in the
      absence of mTORC1 activity. We further demonstrated that the reactivation of
      mTORC1 in those cells restored their leukemia-initiating capacity. Thus, AML
      cells lacking mTORC1 activity can self-renew as AML stem cells. Our findings
      provide mechanistic insight into how residual tumor cells circumvent anticancer
      therapies and drive tumor recurrence.

TI  - TSLP Signaling Network Revealed by SILAC-Based Phosphoproteomics*.
LID - M112.017764
AB  - Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that plays diverse roles in the
      regulation of immune responses. TSLP requires a heterodimeric receptor complex
      consisting of IL-7 receptor α subunit and its unique TSLP receptor (gene symbol
      CRLF2) to transmit signals in cells. Abnormal TSLP signaling (e.g. overexpression
      of TSLP or its unique receptor TSLPR) contributes to the development of a number 
      of diseases including asthma and leukemia. However, a detailed understanding of
      the signaling pathways activated by TSLP remains elusive. In this study, we
      performed a global quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of the TSLP signaling
      network using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture. By
      employing titanium dioxide in addition to antiphosphotyrosine antibodies as
      enrichment methods, we identified 4164 phosphopeptides on 1670 phosphoproteins.
      Using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-based quantitation, 
      we determined that the phosphorylation status of 226 proteins was modulated by
      TSLP stimulation. Our analysis identified activation of several members of the
      Src and Tec families of kinases including Btk, Lyn, and Tec by TSLP for the first
      time. In addition, we report TSLP-induced phosphorylation of protein phosphatases
      such as Ptpn6 (SHP-1) and Ptpn11 (Shp2), which has also not been reported
      previously. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Shp2 binds to the adapter
      protein Gab2 in a TSLP-dependent manner. This is the first demonstration of an
      inducible protein complex in TSLP signaling. A kinase inhibitor screen revealed
      that pharmacological inhibition of PI-3 kinase, Jak family kinases, Src family
      kinases or Btk suppressed TSLP-dependent cellular proliferation making them
      candidate therapeutic targets in diseases resulting from aberrant TSLP signaling.
      Our study is the first phosphoproteomic analysis of the TSLP signaling pathway
      that greatly expands our understanding of TSLP signaling and provides novel
      therapeutic targets for TSLP/TSLPR-associated diseases in humans.

TI  - Research Resource: Identification of Novel Growth Hormone-Regulated
      Phosphorylation Sites by Quantitative Phosphoproteomics.
PG  - 1056-73
AB  - GH and GH receptors are expressed throughout life, and GH elicits a diverse range
      of responses, including growth and altered metabolism. It is therefore important 
      to understand the full spectrum of GH signaling pathways and cellular responses. 
      We applied mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics combined with stable isotope
      labeling with amino acids in cell culture to identify proteins rapidly
      phosphorylated in response to GH in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes. We identified 132
      phosphosites in 95 proteins that exhibited rapid (5 or 15 min) GH-dependent
      statistically significant increases in phosphorylation by more than or equal to
      50% and 96 phosphosites in 46 proteins that were down-regulated by GH by more
      than or equal to 30%. Several of the GH-stimulated phosphorylation sites were
      known (e.g. regulatory Thr/Tyr in Erks 1 and 2, Tyr in signal transducers and
      activators of transcription (Stat) 5a and 5b, Ser939 in tuberous sclerosis
      protein (TSC) 2 or tuberin). The remaining 126 GH-stimulated sites were not
      previously associated with GH. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway
      analysis of GH-stimulated sites indicated enrichment in proteins associated with 
      the insulin and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, regulation of the 
      actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesions. Akt/protein kinase A consensus sites
      (RXRXXS/T) were the most commonly phosphorylated consensus sites. Immunoblotting 
      confirmed GH-stimulated phosphorylation of all seven novel GH-dependent sites
      tested [regulatory sites in proline-rich Akt substrate, 40 kDA (PRAS40),
      regulatory associated protein of mTOR, ATP-citrate lyase, Na+/H+ exchanger-1,
      N-myc downstream regulated gene 1, and Shc]). The immunoblot results suggest that
      many, if not most, of the GH-stimulated phosphosites identified in this
      large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis, including sites in multiple 
      proteins in the Akt/ mTOR complex 1 pathway, are phosphorylated in response to
      GH. Their identification significantly broadens our thinking of GH-regulated cell
      functions.

TI  - Single-step inline hydroxyapatite enrichment facilitates identification and
      quantitation of phosphopeptides from mass-limited proteomes with MudPIT.
PG  - 2697-709
AB  - Herein we report the characterization and optimization of single-step inline
      enrichment of phosphopeptides directly from small amounts of whole cell and
      tissue lysates (100 – 500 μg) using a hydroxyapatite (HAP) microcolumn and
      Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT). In comparison to a
      triplicate HILIC-IMAC phosphopeptide enrichment study, ~80% of the
      phosphopeptides identified using HAP-MudPIT were unique. Similarly, analysis of
      the consensus phosphorylation motifs between the two enrichment methods
      illustrates the complementarity of calcium-and iron-based enrichment methods and 
      the higher sensitivity and selectivity of HAP-MudPIT for acidic motifs. We
      demonstrate how the identification of more multiply phosphorylated peptides from 
      HAP-MudPIT can be used to quantify phosphorylation cooperativity. Through
      optimization of HAP-MudPIT on a whole cell lysate we routinely achieved
      identification and quantification of ca. 1000 phosphopeptides from a ~1 hr
      enrichment and 12 hr MudPIT analysis on small quantities of material. Finally, we
      applied this optimized method to identify phosphorylation sites from a
      mass-limited mouse brain region, the amygdala (200 – 500 μg), identifying up to
      4000 phosphopeptides per run.

TI  - The role of targeted chemical proteomics in pharmacology.
PG  - 457-75
AB  - Traditionally, proteomics is the high-throughput characterization of the global
      complement of proteins in a biological system using cutting-edge technologies
      (robotics and mass spectrometry) and bioinformatics tools (Internet-based search 
      engines and databases). As the field of proteomics has matured, a diverse range
      of strategies have evolved to answer specific problems. Chemical proteomics is
      one such direction that provides the means to enrich and detect less abundant
      proteins (the ‘hidden’ proteome) from complex mixtures of wide dynamic range (the
      ‘deep’ proteome). In pharmacology, chemical proteomics has been utilized to
      determine the specificity of drugs and their analogues, for anticipated known
      targets, only to discover other proteins that bind and could account for side
      effects observed in preclinical and clinical trials. As a consequence, chemical
      proteomics provides a valuable accessory in refinement of second- and
      third-generation drug design for treatment of many diseases. However, determining
      definitive affinity capture of proteins by a drug immobilized on soft gel
      chromatography matrices has highlighted some of the challenges that remain to be 
      addressed. Examples of the different strategies that have emerged using
      well-established drugs against pharmaceutically important enzymes, such as
      protein kinases, metalloproteases, PDEs, cytochrome P450s, etc., indicate the
      potential opportunity to employ chemical proteomics as an early-stage screening
      approach in the identification of new targets.

TI  - The SUMO E3-ligase PIAS1 regulates the tumor suppressor PML and its oncogenic
      counterpart PML-RARA.
PG  - 2275-84
AB  - The ubiquitin-like SUMO proteins covalently modify protein substrates and
      regulate their functional properties. In a broad spectrum of cancers, the tumor
      suppressor PML undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation primed by CK2
      phosphorylation. Here we report that the SUMO E3-ligase inhibitor PIAS1 regulates
      oncogenic signaling through its ability to sumoylate PML and the PML-RARA
      oncoprotein of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). PIAS1-mediated SUMOylation of 
      PML promoted CK2 interaction and ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of
      PML, attenuating its tumor suppressor functions. In addition, PIAS1-mediated
      SUMOylation of PML-RARA was essential for induction of its degradation by arsenic
      trioxide, an effective APL treatment. Moreover, PIAS1 suppression abrogated the
      ability of arsenic trioxide to trigger apoptosis in APL cells. Lastly, PIAS1 was 
      also essential for PML degradation in non-small cell lung cancer cells, and PML
      and PIAS1 were inversely correlated in NSCLC cell lines and primary specimens.
      Together, our findings reveal novel roles for PIAS1 and the SUMOylation machinery
      in regulating oncogenic networks and the response to leukemia therapy.

TI  - Structure, Regulation, Signaling, and Targeting of Abl Kinases in Cancer.
PG  - 436-46
AB  - Abl kinases are prototypic cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and are involved in a
      variety of chromosomal aberrations in different cancers. This causes the
      expression of Abl fusion proteins, such as Bcr-Abl, that are constitutively
      activated and drivers of tumorigenesis. Over the past decades, biochemical and
      functional studies on the molecular mechanisms of Abl regulation have gone hand
      in hand with progression of our structural understanding of autoinhibited and
      active Abl conformations. In parallel, Abl oncoproteins have become prime
      molecular targets for cancer therapy, using adenosine triphosphate
      (ATP)–competitive kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib. Abl-targeting drugs serve 
      as a paradigm for our understanding of kinase inhibitor action, specificity, and 
      resistance development. In this review article, I will review the molecular
      mechanisms that are responsible for the regulation of Abl kinase activity and how
      oncogenic Abl fusions signal. Furthermore, past and ongoing efforts to target Abl
      oncoproteins using ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors, as well as future
      possibilities using combination therapy, will be discussed.

TI  - Deciphering Phosphotyrosine-Dependent Signaling Networks in Cancer by SH2
      Profiling.
PG  - 353-61
AB  - It has been a decade since the introduction of SH2 profiling, a modular
      domain-based molecular diagnostics tool. This review covers the original concept 
      of SH2 profiling, different analytical platforms, and their applications, from
      the detailed analysis of single proteins to broad screening in translational
      research. Illustrated by practical examples, we discuss the uniqueness and
      advantages of the approach as well as its limitations and challenges. We provide 
      guidance for basic researchers and oncologists who may consider SH2 profiling in 
      their respective cancer research, especially for those focusing on tyrosine
      phosphoproteomics. SH2 profiling can serve as an alternative phosphoproteomics
      tool to dissect aberrant tyrosine kinase pathways responsible for individual
      malignancies, with the goal of facilitating personalized diagnostics for the
      treatment of cancer.

TI  - Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Bmi1 modulates its oncogenic potential, E3 ligase
      activity, and DNA damage repair activity in mouse prostate cancer.
PG  - 1920-32
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major lethal malignancy in men, but the molecular
      events and their interplay underlying prostate carcinogenesis remain poorly
      understood. Epigenetic events and the upregulation of polycomb group silencing
      proteins including Bmi1 have been described to occur during PCa progression.
      Here, we found that conditional overexpression of Bmi1 in mice induced prostatic 
      intraepithelial neoplasia, and elicited invasive adenocarcinoma when combined
      with PTEN haploinsufficiency. In addition, Bmi1 and the PI3K/Akt pathway were
      coactivated in a substantial fraction of human high-grade tumors. We found that
      Akt mediated Bmi1 phosphorylation, enhancing its oncogenic potential in an
      Ink4a/Arf-independent manner. This process also modulated the DNA damage response
      and affected genomic stability. Together, our findings demonstrate the
      etiological role of Bmi1 in PCa, unravel an oncogenic collaboration between Bmi1 
      and the PI3K/Akt pathway, and provide mechanistic insights into the modulation of
      Bmi1 function by phosphorylation during prostate carcinogenesis.
