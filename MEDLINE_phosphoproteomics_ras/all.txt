TI  - ROSICS: CHEMISTRY AND PROTEOMICS OF CYSTEINE MODIFICATIONS IN REDOX BIOLOGY.
PG  - 184-208
AB  - Post-translational modifications (PTMs) occurring in proteins determine their
      functions and regulations. Proteomic tools are available to identify PTMs and
      have proved invaluable to expanding the inventory of these tools of nature that
      hold the keys to biological processes. Cysteine (Cys), the least abundant (1–2%) 
      of amino acid residues, are unique in that they play key roles in maintaining
      stability of protein structure, participating in active sites of enzymes,
      regulating protein function and binding to metals, among others. Cys residues are
      major targets of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are important mediators and
      modulators of various biological processes. It is therefore necessary to identify
      the Cys-containing ROS target proteins, as well as the sites and species of their
      PTMs. Cutting edge proteomic tools which have helped identify the PTMs at
      reactive Cys residues, have also revealed that Cys residues are modified in
      numerous ways. These modifications include formation of disulfide, thiosulfinate 
      and thiosulfonate, oxidation to sulfenic, sulfinic, sulfonic acids and
      thiosulfonic acid, transformation to dehydroalanine (DHA) and serine,
      palmitoylation and farnesylation, formation of chemical adducts with glutathione,
      4-hydroxynonenal and 15-deoxy PGJ2, and various other chemicals. We present here,
      a review of relevant ROS biology, possible chemical reactions of Cys residues and
      details of the proteomic strategies employed for rapid, efficient and sensitive
      identification of diverse and novel PTMs involving reactive Cys residues of
      redox-sensitive proteins. We propose a new name, “ROSics,” for the science which 
      describes the principles of mode of action of ROS at molecular levels. © 2014 The

TI  - Delineation of a Conserved Arrestin-Biased Signaling Repertoire In Vivo.
PG  - 706-17
AB  - Biased G protein–coupled receptor agonists engender a restricted repertoire of
      downstream events from their cognate receptors, permitting them to produce mixed 
      agonist-antagonist effects in vivo. While this opens the possibility of novel
      therapeutics, it complicates rational drug design, since the in vivo response to 
      a biased agonist cannot be reliably predicted from its in cellula efficacy. We
      have employed novel informatic approaches to characterize the in vivo
      transcriptomic signature of the arrestin pathway-selective parathyroid hormone
      analog [d-Trp12, Tyr34]bovine PTH(7-34) in six different murine tissues after
      chronic drug exposure. We find that [d-Trp12, Tyr34]bovine PTH(7-34) elicits a
      distinctive arrestin-signaling focused transcriptomic response that is more
      coherently regulated across tissues than that of the pluripotent agonist, human
      PTH(1-34). This arrestin-focused network is closely associated with
      transcriptional control of cell growth and development. Our demonstration of a
      conserved arrestin-dependent transcriptomic signature suggests a framework within
      which the in vivo outcomes of arrestin-biased signaling may be generalized.

TI  - Differential Reprogramming of Isogenic Colorectal Cancer Cells by Distinct
      Activating KRAS Mutations.
PG  - 1535-46
AB  - Oncogenic mutations of Ras at codons 12, 13, or 61, that render the protein
      constitutively active, are found in ∼16% of all cancer cases. Among the three
      major Ras isoforms, KRAS is the most frequently mutated isoform in cancer. Each
      Ras isoform and tumor type displays a distinct pattern of codon-specific
      mutations. In colon cancer, KRAS is typically mutated at codon 12, but a
      significant fraction of patients have mutations at codon 13. Clinical data
      suggest different outcomes and responsiveness to treatment between these two
      groups. To investigate the differential effects upon cell status associated with 
      KRAS mutations we performed a quantitative analysis of the proteome and
      phosphoproteome of isogenic SW48 colon cancer cell lines in which one allele of
      the endogenous gene has been edited to harbor specific KRAS mutations (G12V,
      G12D, or G13D). Each mutation generates a distinct signature, with the most
      variability seen between G13D and the codon 12 KRAS mutants. One notable example 
      of specific up-regulation in KRAS codon 12 mutant SW48 cells is provided by the
      short form of the colon cancer stem cell marker doublecortin-like Kinase 1
      (DCLK1) that can be reversed by suppression of KRAS.

TI  - Identification of Caveolar Resident Proteins in Ventricular Myocytes Using a
      Quantitative Proteomic Approach: Dynamic Changes in Caveolar Composition
      Following Adrenoceptor Activation*.
PG  - 596-608
AB  - The lipid raft concept proposes that membrane environments enriched in
      cholesterol and sphingolipids cluster certain proteins and form platforms to
      integrate cell signaling. In cardiac muscle, caveolae concentrate signaling
      molecules and ion transporters, and play a vital role in adrenergic regulation of
      excitation–contraction coupling, and consequently cardiac contractility.
      Proteomic analysis of cardiac caveolae is hampered by the presence of
      contaminants that have sometimes, erroneously, been proposed to be resident in
      these domains. Here we present the first unbiased analysis of the proteome of
      cardiac caveolae, and investigate dynamic changes in their protein constituents
      following adrenoreceptor (AR) stimulation.Rat ventricular myocytes were treated
      with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) to deplete cholesterol and disrupt caveolae.
      Buoyant caveolin-enriched microdomains (BCEMs) were prepared from MβCD-treated
      and control cell lysates using a standard discontinuous sucrose gradient. BCEMs
      were harvested, pelleted, and resolubilized, then alkylated, digested, and
      labeled with iTRAQ reagents, and proteins identified by LC-MS/MS on a LTQ
      Orbitrap Velos Pro. Proteins were defined as BCEM resident if they were
      consistently depleted from the BCEM fraction following MβCD treatment. Selective 
      activation of α-, β1-, and β2-AR prior to preparation of BCEMs was achieved by
      application of agonist/antagonist pairs for 10 min in populations of
      field-stimulated myocytes.We typically identified 600–850 proteins per
      experiment, of which, 249 were defined as high-confidence BCEM residents.
      Functional annotation clustering indicates cardiac BCEMs are enriched in integrin
      signaling, guanine nucleotide binding, ion transport, and insulin signaling
      clusters. Proteins possessing a caveolin binding motif were poorly enriched in
      BCEMs, suggesting this is not the only mechanism that targets proteins to
      caveolae. With the notable exception of the cavin family, very few proteins show 
      altered abundance in BCEMs following AR activation, suggesting signaling
      complexes are preformed in BCEMs to ensure a rapid and high fidelity response to 
      adrenergic stimulation in cardiac muscle.

TI  - A crowd-sourcing approach for the construction of species-specific cell signaling
      networks.
PG  - 484-91
AB  - Motivation: Animal models are important tools in drug discovery and for
      understanding human biology in general. However, many drugs that initially show
      promising results in rodents fail in later stages of clinical trials.
      Understanding the commonalities and differences between human and rat cell
      signaling networks can lead to better experimental designs, improved allocation
      of resources and ultimately better drugs.Results: The sbv IMPROVER
      Species-Specific Network Inference challenge was designed to use the power of the
      crowds to build two species-specific cell signaling networks given
      phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics and cytokine data generated from NHBE and NRBE
      cells exposed to various stimuli. A common literature-inspired reference network 
      with 220 nodes and 501 edges was also provided as prior knowledge from which
      challenge participants could add or remove edges but not nodes. Such a large
      network inference challenge not based on synthetic simulations but on real data
      presented unique difficulties in scoring and interpreting the results. Because
      any prior knowledge about the networks was already provided to the participants
      for reference, novel ways for scoring and aggregating the results were developed.
      Two human and rat consensus networks were obtained by combining all the inferred 
      networks. Further analysis showed that major signaling pathways were conserved
      between the two species with only isolated components diverging, as in the case
      of ribosomal S6 kinase RPS6KA1. Overall, the consensus between inferred edges was
      relatively high with the exception of the downstream targets of transcription
      factors, which seemed more difficult to predict.Contact:ebilal@us.ibm.com or

TI  - Understanding the limits of animal models as predictors of human biology: lessons
      learned from the sbv IMPROVER Species Translation Challenge.
PG  - 471-83
AB  - Motivation: Inferring how humans respond to external cues such as drugs,
      chemicals, viruses or hormones is an essential question in biomedicine. Very
      often, however, this question cannot be addressed because it is not possible to
      perform experiments in humans. A reasonable alternative consists of generating
      responses in animal models and ‘translating’ those results to humans. The
      limitations of such translation, however, are far from clear, and systematic
      assessments of its actual potential are urgently needed. sbv IMPROVER (systems
      biology verification for Industrial Methodology for PROcess VErification in
      Research) was designed as a series of challenges to address translatability
      between humans and rodents. This collaborative crowd-sourcing initiative invited 
      scientists from around the world to apply their own computational methodologies
      on a multilayer systems biology dataset composed of phosphoproteomics,
      transcriptomics and cytokine data derived from normal human and rat bronchial
      epithelial cells exposed in parallel to 52 different stimuli under identical
      conditions. Our aim was to understand the limits of species-to-species
      translatability at different levels of biological organization: signaling,
      transcriptional and release of secreted factors (such as cytokines).
      Participating teams submitted 49 different solutions across the sub-challenges,
      two-thirds of which were statistically significantly better than random.
      Additionally, similar computational methods were found to range widely in their
      performance within the same challenge, and no single method emerged as a clear
      winner across all sub-challenges. Finally, computational methods were able to
      effectively translate some specific stimuli and biological processes in the lung 
      epithelial system, such as DNA synthesis, cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, 
      translation, immune/inflammation and growth factor/proliferation pathways, better
      than the expected response similarity between species.Contact:pmeyerr@us.ibm.com

TI  - Inter-species prediction of protein phosphorylation in the sbv IMPROVER species
      translation challenge.
PG  - 453-61
AB  - Motivation: Animal models are widely used in biomedical research for reasons
      ranging from practical to ethical. An important issue is whether rodent models
      are predictive of human biology. This has been addressed recently in the
      framework of a series of challenges designed by the systems biology verification 
      for Industrial Methodology for Process Verification in Research (sbv IMPROVER)
      initiative. In particular, one of the sub-challenges was devoted to the
      prediction of protein phosphorylation responses in human bronchial epithelial
      cells, exposed to a number of different chemical stimuli, given the responses in 
      rat bronchial epithelial cells. Participating teams were asked to make
      inter-species predictions on the basis of available training examples, comprising
      transcriptomics and phosphoproteomics data.Results: Here, the two best performing
      teams present their data-driven approaches and computational methods. In
      addition, post hoc analyses of the datasets and challenge results were performed 
      by the participants and challenge organizers. The challenge outcome indicates
      that successful prediction of protein phosphorylation status in human based on
      rat phosphorylation levels is feasible. However, within the limitations of the
      computational tools used, the inclusion of gene expression data does not improve 
      the prediction quality. The post hoc analysis of time-specific measurements sheds
      light on the signaling pathways in both species.Availability and implementation: 
      A detailed description of the dataset, challenge design and outcome is available 
      at www.sbvimprover.com. The code used by team IGB is provided under
      http://github.com/uci-igb/improver2013. Implementations of the algorithms applied
      by team AMG are available at

TI  - A novel therapeutic effect of statins on nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
PG  - 265-82
AB  - Statins competitively inhibit hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A
      reductase, resulting in reduced plasma total and low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol levels. Recently, it has been shown that statins exert additional
      ‘pleiotropic’ effects by increasing expression levels of the membrane water
      channels aquaporin 2 (AQP2). AQP2 is localized mainly in the kidney and plays a
      critical role in determining cellular water content. This additional effect is
      independent of cholesterol homoeostasis, and depends on depletion of
      mevalonate-derived intermediates of sterol synthetic pathways, i.e.
      farnesylpyrophosphate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. By up-regulating the
      expression levels of AQP2, statins increase water reabsorption by the kidney,
      thus opening up a new avenue in treating patients with nephrogenic diabetes
      insipidus (NDI), a hereditary disease that yet lacks high-powered and limited
      side effects therapy. Aspects related to water balance determined by AQP2 in the 
      kidney, as well as standard and novel therapeutic strategies of NDI are
      discussed.

TI  - Small molecule inhibition of group I p21-activated kinases in breast cancer
      induces apoptosis and potentiates the activity of microtubule stabilizing agents.
LID - 59
AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer, the most common cause of cancer-related deaths
      worldwide among women, is a molecularly and clinically heterogeneous disease.
      Extensive genetic and epigenetic profiling of breast tumors has recently revealed
      novel putative driver genes, including p21-activated kinase (PAK)1. PAK1 is a
      serine/threonine kinase downstream of small GTP-binding proteins, Rac1 and Cdc42,
      and is an integral component of growth factor signaling networks and cellular
      functions fundamental to tumorigenesis. Methods: PAK1 dysregulation (copy number 
      gain, mRNA and protein expression) was evaluated in two cohorts of breast cancer 
      tissues (n = 980 and 1,108). A novel small molecule inhibitor, FRAX1036, and RNA 
      interference were used to examine PAK1 loss of function and combination with
      docetaxel in vitro. Mechanism of action for the therapeutic combination, both
      cellular and molecular, was assessed via time-lapse microscopy and
      immunoblotting. Results: We demonstrate that focal genomic amplification and
      overexpression of PAK1 are associated with poor clinical outcome in the luminal
      subtype of breast cancer (P = 1.29 × 10−4 and P = 0.015, respectively). Given the
      role for PAK1 in regulating cytoskeletal organization, we hypothesized that
      combination of PAK1 inhibition with taxane treatment could be combined to further
      interfere with microtubule dynamics and cell survival. Consistent with this,
      administration of docetaxel with either a novel small molecule inhibitor of group
      I PAKs, FRAX1036, or PAK1 small interfering RNA oligonucleotides dramatically
      altered signaling to cytoskeletal-associated proteins, such as stathmin, and
      induced microtubule disorganization and cellular apoptosis. Live-cell imaging
      revealed that the duration of mitotic arrest mediated by docetaxel was
      significantly reduced in the presence of FRAX1036, and this was associated with
      increased kinetics of apoptosis. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings
      further support PAK1 as a potential target in breast cancer and suggest
      combination with taxanes as a viable strategy to increase anti-tumor efficacy.

TI  - Role of Rebiopsy in Relapsed Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer for Directing Oncology
      Treatments.
LID - 809835
AB  - Background. Currently, few rebiopsies are performed in relapses of advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer. They are not customary in clinical practice of lung
      cancer. However, it is not possible to properly target treatments in cases of
      relapse without knowing the nature of new lesions. Design. This paper
      comprehensively summarizes the available literature about rebiopsy and broadly
      discusses the importance of rebiopsy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
      Results. Altogether 560 abstracts were used as material for further analysis. 19 
      articles were about clinical rebiopsy in lung cancer and were reviewed in
      detailed manner. Conclusions. This review shows that rebiopsy is feasible in
      non-small cell lung cancer, and success rates can be high if rebiopsy is
      accompanied by adequate evaluation before biopsy. Its use may resolve the
      difficulties in sampling bias and detecting changes in cancer characteristics. In
      cases where treatment was selected based on tissue characteristics that then
      change, the treatment selection process must be repeated while considering new
      characteristics of the tumor. Rebiopsy may be used to predict therapeutic
      resistance and consequently redirect targeted therapies. Such knowledge may
      resolve the difficulties in sampling bias and also in selecting preexisting
      clones or formulating drug-resistant ones. Rebiopsy should be performed more
      often in non-small cell lung cancer.

TI  - A phosphoproteomic screen demonstrates differential dependence on HER3 for MAP
      kinase pathway activation by distinct PIK3CA mutations.
PG  - 318-26
AB  - The PIK3CA gene encodes for the p110 alpha isoform of PI3 kinase and is one of
      the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancers. However, the mechanisms
      by which PIK3CA mutations activate cell signaling are not fully understood. Here 
      we used a phosphoproteomic approach to compare differential phosphorylation
      patterns between human breast epithelial cells and two isogenic somatic cell
      knock in derivatives, each harboring a distinct PIK3CA mutation. We demonstrated 
      differential phosphorylation patterns between isogenic cell lines containing a
      PIK3CA helical domain mutation (E545K) compared to cells with a PIK3CA kinase
      domain mutation (H1047R). In particular, the receptor tyrosine kinase, HER3,
      showed increased phosphorylation at tyrosine 1328 in H1047R cells versus E545K
      cells. Genetic studies using shRNA demonstrated that H1047R cells have a profound
      decrease in growth factor independent proliferation upon HER3 knock down, but
      this effect was attenuated in E545K cells. In addition, HER3 knock down led to
      reductions in both PI3 kinase and MAP kinase pathway activation in H1047R cells, 
      but in E545K cells only PI3 kinase pathway diminution was observed. These studies
      demonstrate the power of using paired isogenic cell lines for proteomic analysis 
      to gain new insights into oncogenic signal transduction pathways.

TI  - Mapping the route from naive pluripotency to lineage specification.
LID - 20130540
AB  - In the mouse blastocyst, epiblast cells are newly formed shortly before
      implantation. They possess a unique developmental plasticity, termed naive
      pluripotency. For development to proceed, this naive state must be subsumed by
      multi-lineage differentiation within 72 h following implantation. In vitro
      differentiation of naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) cultured in controlled
      conditions provides a tractable system to dissect and understand the process of
      exit from naive pluripotency and entry into lineage specification. Exploitation
      of this system in recent large-scale RNAi and mutagenesis screens has uncovered
      multiple new factors and modules that drive or facilitate progression out of the 
      naive state. Notably, these studies show that the transcription factor network
      that governs the naive state is rapidly dismantled prior to upregulation of
      lineage specification markers, creating an intermediate state that we term
      formative pluripotency. Here, we summarize these findings and propose a road map 
      for state transitions in ESC differentiation that reflects the orderly dynamics
      of epiblast progression in the embryo.

TI  - GENE DOPING IN SPORT – PERSPECTIVES AND RISKS.
PG  - 251-9
AB  - In the past few years considerable progress regarding the knowledge of the human 
      genome map has been achieved. As a result, attempts to use gene therapy in
      patients’ management are more and more often undertaken. The aim of gene therapy 
      is to replace defective genes in vivo and/or to promote the long-term endogenous 
      synthesis of deficient protein. In vitro studies improve the production of human 
      recombinant proteins, such as insulin (INS), growth hormone (GH), insulin-like
      growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and erythropoietin (EPO), which could have therapeutic
      application. Unfortunately, genetic methods developed for therapeutic purposes
      are increasingly being used in competitive sports. Some new substances (e.g.,
      antibodies against myostatin or myostatin blockers) might be used in gene doping 
      in athletes. The use of these substances may cause an increase of body weight and
      muscle mass and a significant improvement of muscle strength. Although it is
      proven that uncontrolled manipulation of genetic material and/or the introduction
      of recombinant proteins may be associated with health risks, athletes are
      increasingly turning to banned gene doping. At the same time, anti-doping
      research is undertaken in many laboratories around the world to try to develop
      and refine ever newer techniques for gene doping detection in sport. Thanks to
      the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and other sports organizations there is a
      hope for real protection of athletes from adverse health effects of gene doping, 
      which at the same time gives a chance to sustain the idea of fair play in sport.

TI  - Tissue phosphoproteomics with PolyMAC identifies potential therapeutic targets in
      a transgenic mouse model of HER2 positive breast cancer.
PG  - 3463-9
AB  - Altered protein phosphorylation is a feature of many human cancers that can be
      targeted therapeutically. Phosphopeptide enrichment is a critical step for
      maximizing the depth of phosphoproteome coverage by MS, but remains challenging
      for tissue specimens because of their high complexity. We describe the first
      analysis of a tissue phosphoproteome using polymer-based metal ion affinity
      capture (PolyMAC), a nanopolymer that has excellent yield and specificity for
      phosphopeptide enrichment, on a transgenic mouse model of HER2-driven breast
      cancer. By combining phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation with PolyMAC, 411 unique
      peptides with 139 phosphotyrosine, 45 phosphoserine, and 29 phosphothreonine
      sites were identified from five LC-MS/MS runs. Combining reverse phase liquid
      chromatography fractionation at pH 8.0 with PolyMAC identified 1571 unique
      peptides with 1279 phosphoserine, 213 phosphothreonine, and 21 phosphotyrosine
      sites from eight LC-MS/MS runs. Linear motif analysis indicated that many of the 
      phosphosites correspond to well-known phosphorylation motifs. Analysis of the
      tyrosine phosphoproteome with the Drug Gene Interaction database uncovered a
      network of potential therapeutic targets centered on Src family kinases with
      inhibitors that are either FDA-approved or in clinical development. These results
      demonstrate that PolyMAC is well suited for phosphoproteomic analysis of tissue
      specimens.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteomics of Cytotoxic T Cells to Reveal Protein Kinase D 2 
      Regulated Networks*.
PG  - 3544-57
AB  - The focus of the present study was to characterize the phosphoproteome of
      cytotoxic T cells and to explore the role of the serine threonine kinase PKD2
      (Protein Kinase D2) in the phosphorylation networks of this key lymphocyte
      population. We used Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids in Culture (SILAC)
      combined with phosphopeptide enrichment and quantitative mass-spectrometry to
      determine the impact of PKD2 loss on the cytotoxic T cells phosphoproteome. We
      identified 15,871 phosphorylations on 3505 proteins in cytotoxic T cells. 450
      phosphosites on 281 proteins were down-regulated and 300 phosphosites on 196
      proteins were up-regulated in PKD2 null cytotoxic T cells. These data give
      valuable new insights about the protein phosphorylation networks operational in
      effector T cells and reveal that PKD2 regulates directly and indirectly about 5% 
      of the cytotoxic T-cell phosphoproteome. PKD2 candidate substrates identified in 
      this study include proteins involved in two distinct biological functions:
      regulation of protein sorting and intracellular vesicle trafficking, and control 
      of chromatin structure, transcription, and translation. In other cell types, PKD 
      substrates include class II histone deacetylases such as HDAC7 and actin
      regulatory proteins such as Slingshot. The current data show these are not PKD
      substrates in primary T cells revealing that the functional role of PKD isoforms 
      is different in different cell lineages.

TI  - Chk2 and REGγ-dependent DBC1 regulation in DNA damage induced apoptosis.
PG  - 13150-60
AB  - Human DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1; KIAA1967; CCAR2) is a protein implicated 
      in the regulation of apoptosis, transcription and histone modifications. Upon DNA
      damage, DBC1 is phosphorylated by ATM/ATR on Thr454 and this modification
      increases its inhibitory interaction with SIRT1, leading to p53 acetylation and
      p53-dependent apoptosis. Here, we report that the inhibition of SIRT1 by DBC1 in 
      the DNA damage response (DDR) also depends on Chk2, the transducer kinase that is
      activated by ATM upon DNA lesions and contributes to the spreading of DNA damage 
      signal. Indeed we found that inactivation of Chk2 reduces DBC1-SIRT1 binding,
      thus preventing p53 acetylation and DBC1-induced apoptosis. These events are
      mediated by Chk2 phosphorylation of the 11S proteasome activator REGγ on Ser247, 
      which increases REGγ-DBC1 interaction and SIRT1 inhibition. Overall our results
      clarify the mechanisms underlying the DBC1-dependent SIRT1 inhibition and link,
      for the first time, Chk2 and REGγ to the ATM-DBC1-SIRT1 axis.

TI  - hnRNPA1 couples nuclear export and translation of specific mRNAs downstream of
      FGF-2/S6K2 signalling.
PG  - 12483-97
AB  - The increased cap-independent translation of anti-apoptotic proteins is involved 
      in the development of drug resistance in lung cancer but signalling events
      regulating this are poorly understood. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2)
      signalling-induced S6 kinase 2 (S6K2) activation is necessary, but the downstream
      mediator(s) coupling this kinase to the translational response is unknown. Here, 
      we show that S6K2 binds and phosphorylates hnRNPA1 on novel Ser4/6 sites,
      increasing its association with BCL-XL and XIAP mRNAs to promote their nuclear
      export. In the cytoplasm, phosphoS4/6-hnRNPA1 dissociates from these mRNAs
      de-repressing their IRES-mediated translation. This correlates with the
      phosphorylation-dependent association of hnRNPA1 with 14-3-3 leading to hnRNPA1
      sumoylation on K183 and its re-import into the nucleus. A non-phosphorylatible,
      S4/6A mutant prevented these processes, hindering the pro-survival activity of
      FGF-2/S6K2 signalling. Interestingly, immunohistochemical staining of lung and
      breast cancer tissue samples demonstrated that increased S6K2 expression
      correlates with decreased cytoplasmic hnRNPA1 and increased BCL-XL expression. In
      short, phosphorylation on novel N-term sites of hnRNPA1 promotes translation of
      anti-apoptotic proteins and is indispensable for the pro-survival effects of
      FGF-2.

TI  - Fragile X spectrum disorders.
PG  - 134-46
AB  - The fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1), which codes for the fragile X
      mental retardation 1 protein (FMRP), is located at Xp27.3. The normal allele of
      the FMR1 gene typically has 5 to 40 CGG repeats in the 5′ untranslated region;
      abnormal alleles of dynamic mutations include the full mutation (> 200 CGG
      repeats), premutation (55–200 CGG repeats) and the gray zone mutation (45–54 CGG 
      repeats). Premutation carriers are common in the general population with
      approximately 1 in 130–250 females and 1 in 250–810 males, whereas the full
      mutation and Fragile X syndrome (FXS) occur in approximately 1 in 4000 to 1 in
      7000. FMR1 mutations account for a variety of phenotypes including the most
      common monogenetic cause of inherited intellectual disability (ID) and autism
      (FXS), the most common genetic form of ovarian failure, the fragile X-associated 
      primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI, premutation); and fragile X-associated
      tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS, premutation). The premutation can also cause
      developmental problems including ASD and ADHD especially in boys and
      psychopathology including anxiety and depression in children and adults. Some
      premutation carriers can have a deficit of FMRP and some unmethylated full
      mutation individuals can have elevated FMR1 mRNA that is considered a premutation
      problem. Therefore the term “Fragile X Spectrum Disorder” (FXSD) should be used
      to include the wide range of overlapping phenotypes observed in affected
      individuals with FMR1 mutations. In this review we focus on the phenotypes and
      genotypes of children with FXSD.

TI  - Syk Interacts with and Phosphorylates Nucleolin To Stabilize Bcl-xL mRNA and
      Promote Cell Survival.
PG  - 3788-99
AB  - The Syk protein tyrosine kinase, a well-characterized regulator of immune cell
      function, plays an increasingly recognized role in tumorigenesis as a promoter of
      cell survival in both hematological and nonhematological malignancies. We show
      here that the expression of Syk in MCF7 or MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells or in
      DG75 B-lymphoma cells protects cells from apoptosis induced by oxidative or
      genotoxic stress by stabilizing the mRNA for Bcl-xL, an antiapoptotic protein.
      Syk binds robustly to nucleolin and phosphorylates it on tyrosine, enhancing its 
      ability to bind the Bcl-xL mRNA. Consequently, reducing the level of nucleolin by
      RNA interference attenuates the ability of Syk to protect cells from
      stress-induced cell death.

      features.
PG  - E4066-75
AB  - Cancer cells characteristically express proteins with immature O-glycosylation,
      but how and why cancer cells express immature O-glycans has remained poorly
      understood. Here, we report that one prevalent mechanism in pancreatic cancer is 
      epigenetic silencing, rather than somatic mutations in a key chaperone, core 1
      β3-Gal-T-specific molecular chaperone (COSMC), required for mature elongated
      O-glycosylation. We also demonstrate, with the use of well-defined cell systems
      generated by precise gene editing, that the aberrant O-glycophenotype by itself
      induces oncogenic features with enhanced growth and invasion. Our study suggests 
      that the characteristic aberrant O-glycophenotype is critical for the development
      and behavior of cancer and further provides support for immunotherapeutic
      strategies that target aberrant O-glycans.

TI  - EGFR phosphorylation of DCBLD2 recruits TRAF6 and stimulates AKT-promoted
      tumorigenesis.
PG  - 3741-56
AB  - Aberrant activation of EGFR in human cancers promotes tumorigenesis through
      stimulation of AKT signaling. Here, we determined that the discoidina
      neuropilin-like membrane protein DCBLD2 is upregulated in clinical specimens of
      glioblastomas and head and neck cancers (HNCs) and is required for
      EGFR-stimulated tumorigenesis. In multiple cancer cell lines, EGFR activated
      phosphorylation of tyrosine 750 (Y750) of DCBLD2, which is located within a
      recently identified binding motif for TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6).
      Consequently, phosphorylation of DCBLD2 Y750 recruited TRAF6, leading to
      increased TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and subsequent activation of AKT,
      thereby enhancing EGFR-driven tumorigenesis. Moreover, evaluation of patient
      samples of gliomas and HNCs revealed an association among EGFR activation, DCBLD2
      phosphorylation, and poor prognoses. Together, our findings uncover a pathway in 
      which DCBLD2 functions as a signal relay for oncogenic EGFR signaling to promote 
      tumorigenesis and suggest DCBLD2 and TRAF6 as potential therapeutic targets for
      human cancers that are associated with EGFR activation.

TI  - Targeting mTOR dependency in pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 1481-9
AB  - Objective: Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the
      Western world. Current chemotherapy regimens have modest survival benefit. Thus, 
      novel, effective therapies are required for treatment of this disease. Design:
      Activating KRAS mutation almost always drives pancreatic tumour initiation,
      however, deregulation of other potentially druggable pathways promotes tumour
      progression. PTEN loss leads to acceleration of KrasG12D-driven pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in mice and these tumours have high levels of mammalian
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling. To test whether these KRAS PTEN pancreatic
      tumours show mTOR dependence, we compared response to mTOR inhibition in this
      model, to the response in another established model of pancreatic cancer, KRAS
      P53. We also assessed whether there was a subset of pancreatic cancer patients
      who may respond to mTOR inhibition. Results: We found that tumours in KRAS PTEN
      mice exhibit a remarkable dependence on mTOR signalling. In these tumours, mTOR
      inhibition leads to proliferative arrest and even tumour regression. Further, we 
      could measure response using clinically applicable positron emission tomography
      imaging. Importantly, pancreatic tumours driven by activated KRAS and mutant p53 
      did not respond to treatment. In human tumours, approximately 20% of cases
      demonstrated low PTEN expression and a gene expression signature that overlaps
      with murine KRAS PTEN tumours. Conclusions: KRAS PTEN tumours are uniquely
      responsive to mTOR inhibition. Targeted anti-mTOR therapies may offer clinical
      benefit in subsets of human PDAC selected based on genotype, that are dependent
      on mTOR signalling. Thus, the genetic signatures of human tumours could be used
      to direct pancreatic cancer treatment in the future.

TI  - Oncogene Mimicry as a Mechanism of Primary Resistance to BRAF Inhibitors.
PG  - 1037-48
AB  - Despite the development of potent RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
      pathway inhibitors, only a fraction of BRAF-mutant patients benefit from
      treatment with these drugs. Using a combined chemogenomics and chemoproteomics
      approach, we identify drug-induced RAS-RAF-MEK complex formation in a subset of
      BRAF-mutant cancer cells characterized by primary resistance to vemurafenib. In
      these cells, autocrine interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion may contribute to the
      primary resistance phenotype via induction of JAK/STAT3 and MAPK signaling. In a 
      subset of cell lines, combined IL-6/MAPK inhibition is able to overcome primary
      resistance to BRAF-targeted therapy. Overall, we show that the signaling
      plasticity exerted by primary resistant BRAF-mutant cells is achieved by their
      ability to mimic signaling features of oncogenic RAS, a strategy that we term
      “oncogene mimicry.” This model may guide future strategies for overcoming primary
      resistance observed in these tumors.

TI  - Molecular modulation of the copper and cisplatin transport function of CTR1 and
      its interaction with IRS-4.
PG  - 379-87
AB  - The copper influx transporter CTR1 is also a major influx transporter for
      cisplatin (cDDP) in tumor cells. It influences the cytotoxicity of cDDP both in
      vivo and in vitro. Whereas Cu triggers internalization of CTR1 from the plasma
      membrane, cDDP does not. To investigate the mechanisms of these effects,
      myc-tagged forms of wild type hCTR1 and variants in which Y103 was converted to
      alanine, C189 was converted to serine, or the K178/K179 dilysine motif was
      converted to alanines were re-expressed in mouse embryo cells in which both
      alleles of CTR1 had been knocked out and also in HEK293T cells. The Y103A
      mutation and to a lesser extent the C189S mutation reduced internalization of
      CTR1 induced by Cu while the K178A/K179A had little effect. Both Y103 and C189
      were required for Cu and cDDP transport whereas the K178/K179 motif was not.
      While Y103 lies in an YXXM motif that, when phosphorylated, is a potential
      docking site for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and other proteins involved in
      endocytosis, Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated myc-CTR1, and proteomic 
      analysis of peptides derived from CTR1, failed to identify any basal or
      Cu-induced phosphorylation. However, proteomic analysis did identify an
      interaction of CTR1 with IRS-4 and this was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation
      from HEK cells expressing either FLAG-CTR1 or myc-CTR1. The interaction was
      greater in the Y103A-expressing cells. We conclude that Y103 is required for the 
      internalization of hCTR1 in response to Cu, that this occurs by a mechanism other
      than phosphorylation and that mutation of Y103 modulates the interaction with
      IRS-4.

TI  - Phosphorylation of nucleoporin Tpr governs its differential localization and is
      required for its mitotic function.
PG  - 3505-20
AB  - A major constituent of the nuclear basket region of the nuclear pore complex
      (NPC), nucleoporin Tpr, plays roles in regulating multiple important processes.
      We have previously established that Tpr is phosphorylated in both a
      MAP-kinase-dependent and MAP-kinase-independent manner, and that Tpr acts as both
      a substrate and as a scaffold for ERK2 (also known as MAPK1). Here, we report the
      identification of S2059 and S2094 as the major novel ERK-independent
      phosphorylation sites and T1677, S2020, S2023 and S2034 as additional
      ERK-independent phosphorylation sites found in the Tpr protein in vivo. Our
      results suggest that protein kinase A phosphorylates the S2094 residue and that
      the site is hyperphosphorylated during mitosis. Furthermore, we find that Tpr is 
      phosphorylated at the S2059 residue by CDK1 and the phosphorylated form
      distinctly localizes with chromatin during telophase. Abrogation of S2059
      phosphorylation abolishes the interaction of Tpr with Mad1, thus compromising the
      localization of both Mad1 and Mad2 proteins, resulting in cell cycle defects. The
      identification of novel phosphorylation sites on Tpr and the observations
      presented in this study allow better understanding of Tpr functions.

AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) controls cell growth and
      metabolism in response to nutrients, growth factors, and cellular energy.
      Aberrant mTORC1 signaling is implicated in human diseases such as diabetes,
      obesity, and cancer. Our results reveal that ectopic mTORC1 activation in the
      liver controls the stress hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in a
      peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α)–dependent
      manner via glutamine depletion, which in turn affects whole-body behavior and
      metabolism. mTORC1 signaling correlates with FGF21 expression in human liver
      tumors, suggesting that our findings in mice may have physiological relevance in 
      glutamine-addicted human cancers. Thus, treatment with the anticancer drug
      rapamycin may have beneficial effects by blocking tumor growth and by preventing 
      deregulation of whole-body physiology due to FGF21 expression.

TI  - PZR Coordinates Shp2 Noonan and LEOPARD Syndrome Signaling in Zebrafish and Mice.
PG  - 2874-89
AB  - Noonan syndrome (NS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by activating
      mutations in the PTPN11 gene encoding Shp2, which manifests in congenital heart
      disease, short stature, and facial dysmorphia. The complexity of Shp2 signaling
      is exemplified by the observation that LEOPARD syndrome (LS) patients possess
      inactivating PTPN11 mutations yet exhibit similar symptoms to NS. Here, we
      identify “protein zero-related” (PZR), a transmembrane glycoprotein that
      interfaces with the extracellular matrix to promote cell migration, as a major
      hyper-tyrosyl-phosphorylated protein in mouse and zebrafish models of NS and LS. 
      PZR hyper-tyrosyl phosphorylation is facilitated in a phosphatase-independent
      manner by enhanced Src recruitment to NS and LS Shp2. In zebrafish, PZR
      overexpression recapitulated NS and LS phenotypes. PZR was required for zebrafish
      gastrulation in a manner dependent upon PZR tyrosyl phosphorylation. Hence, we
      identify PZR as an NS and LS target. Enhanced PZR-mediated membrane recruitment
      of Shp2 serves as a common mechanism to direct overlapping pathophysiological
      characteristics of these PTPN11 mutations.

TI  - Phosphoproteomic analysis identifies the tumor suppressor PDCD4 as a RSK
      substrate negatively regulated by 14-3-3.
PG  - E2918-27
AB  - The RSK family is a group of Ser/Thr kinases that promotes cell growth and
      proliferation in response to the Ras/MAPK pathway. Deregulated RSK activity has
      been associated with different disorders and diseases, such as cancer, but
      relatively little is known regarding the contribution of RSK to tumorigenesis. In
      this study, we describe, to our knowledge, the first global quantitative
      phosphoproteomic screen to characterize RSK-dependent signaling events in
      melanoma. Our results show that RSK negatively regulates the tumor suppressor
      PDCD4 by promoting its association to 14-3-3 proteins and subsequent proteasomal 
      degradation. These findings further implicate RSK as a promising therapeutic
      target for the treatment of melanoma and suggest that RSK plays widespread
      biological functions downstream of the Ras/MAPK pathway.

PG  - 1239-46
AB  - There are important breakthroughs in the treatment of paediatric acute
      lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) since 1950, by which the prognosis of the child
      majority suffered from ALL has been improved. However, there are urgent needs to 
      have disease-specific biomarkers to monitor the therapeutic efficacy and predict 
      the patient prognosis. The present study overviewed proteomics-based research on 
      paediatric ALL to discuss important advances to combat cancer cells and search
      novel and real protein biomarkers of resistance or sensitivity to drugs which
      target the signalling networks. We highlighted the importance and significance of
      a proper phospho-quantitative design and strategy for paediatric ALL between
      relapse and remission, when human body fluids from cerebrospinal, peripheral
      blood, or bone-marrow were applied. The present article also assessed the
      schedule for the analysis of body fluids from patients at different states,
      importance of proteomics-based tools to discover ALL-specific and sensitive
      biomarkers, to stimulate paediatric ALL research via proteomics to ‘build’ the
      reference map of the signalling networks from leukemic cells at relapse, and to
      monitor significant clinical therapies for ALL-relapse.

TI  - Integrating canonical and metabolic signalling programmes in the regulation of T 
      cell responses.
PG  - 435-46
AB  - Over the past decade, our understanding of T cell activation, differentiation and
      function has markedly expanded, providing a greater appreciation of the signals
      and pathways that regulate these processes. It has become clear that
      evolutionarily conserved pathways that regulate stress responses, metabolism,
      autophagy and survival have crucial and specific roles in regulating T cell
      responses. Recent studies suggest that the metabolic pathways involving MYC,
      hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are activated upon antigen recognition and
      that they are required for directing the consequences of T cell receptor
      engagement. The purpose of this Review is to provide an integrated view of the
      role of these metabolic pathways and of canonical T cell signalling pathways in
      regulating the outcome of T cell responses.

TI  - Discoidin domain receptor 2 signaling networks and therapy in lung cancer.
PG  - 900-4
AB  - Discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2) is an atypical receptor tyrosine kinase that
      binds to and is activated by collagen in the extracellular matrix. Recent exon
      sequencing studies have identified DDR2 to be mutated with a 3-4% incidence in
      squamous cell cancers (SCCs) of the lung. This article summarizes the current
      state of knowledge of DDR2 biology and signaling in lung SCC. It also explores
      the context-dependent role of this receptor as both an oncogene and a tumor
      suppressor in cancer cells. Promising therapeutic opportunities based on existing
      and novel targeted small molecule inhibitors against DDR2 may provide new
      strategies for treating lung SCC patients.

      cancer relapse and metastasis and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)/chemokine
      (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) is a key regulator of tumor dissemination. We
      report a large-scale quantification of SDF-1/CXCR4–induced phosphoproteome events
      and identify several previously unidentified phosphoproteins and signaling
      pathways in breast CSCs. This study provides insights into the understanding of
      the mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis.

TI  - Molecular Pathways: Adaptive Kinome Reprogramming in Response to Targeted
      Inhibition of the BRAF-MEK-ERK Pathway in Cancer.
PG  - 2516-22
AB  - The central role of the BRAF-MEK-ERK pathway in controlling cell fate has made
      this pathway a primary target for deregulated activation in cancer. BRaf is
      activated by Ras proteins allowing Ras oncogenes to constitutively activate the
      pathway. Activating BRaf mutations are also frequent in several cancers, being
      the most common oncogenic mutation in thyroid carcinoma and melanoma. There are
      currently two inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, approved for treatment of
      malignant melanoma having activating BRaf mutations. Concurrent administration of
      BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor (trametinib) is significantly more active in
      patients with BRAF mutant melanoma than either single agent alone, but
      progression to resistance ultimately occurs by different mechanisms that increase
      the activation of ERK. Such adaptive changes in tumor cell signaling networks
      allows bypass of targeted oncoprotein inhibition. This is true with targeted
      inhibitors for BRaf and MEK as well as specific inhibitors for AKT, mTOR and many
      receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR and HER2. It is this adaptive response to 
      targeted kinase inhibitors that contributes to the failure of single agent kinase
      inhibitors to have durable responses. This failure is seen in virtually all
      cancers treated with single agent kinase inhibitors, most of which are not as
      dependent on a single signaling pathway such as BRaf-MEK-ERK in melanoma. Thus,
      understanding the breadth of adaptive reprogramming responses to specific
      targeted kinase inhibition will be critical to develop appropriate combination
      therapies for durable clinical responses.

TI  - Both Decreased and Increased SRPK1 Levels Promote Cancer by Interfering with
      PHLPP-Mediated Dephosphorylation of Akt.
PG  - 378-91
AB  - Akt activation is a hallmark of human cancers. Here we report a critical
      mechanism for regulation of Akt activity by the splicing kinase SRPK1, a
      downstream Akt target for transducing growth signals to regulate splicing.
      Surprisingly, we find that SRPK1 has a tumor suppressor function because ablation
      of SRPK1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts induces cell transformation. We link the 
      phenotype to constitutive Akt activation from genome-wide phosphoproteomics
      analysis and discover that down-regulated SRPK1 impairs the recruitment of the
      Akt phosphatase PHLPP1 to Akt. Interestingly, SRPK1 overexpression is also
      tumorigenic because excess SRPK1 squelches PHLPP1. Thus, aberrant SRPK1
      expression in either direction induces constitutive Akt activation, providing a
      mechanistic basis for previous observations that SRPK1 is down-regulated in some 
      cancer contexts and up-regulated in others.

TI  - Global Phosphoproteomic Profiling Reveals Distinct Signatures in B-Cell
      Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas.
PG  - 1331-42
AB  - Deregulation of signaling pathways controlled by protein phosphorylation
      underlies the pathogenesis of hematological malignancies; however, the extent to 
      which deregulated phosphorylation may be involved in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
      (B-NHL) pathogenesis is largely unknown. To identify phosphorylation events
      important in B-NHLs, we performed mass spectrometry–based, label-free,
      semiquantitative phosphoproteomic profiling of 11 cell lines derived from three
      B-NHL categories: Burkitt lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and mantle-cell
      lymphoma. In all, 6579 unique phosphopeptides, corresponding to 1701 unique
      phosphorylated proteins, were identified and quantified. The data are available
      via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD000658. Hierarchical clustering
      highlighted distinct phosphoproteomic signatures associated with each lymphoma
      subtype. Interestingly, germinal center–derived B-NHL cell lines were
      characterized by phosphorylation of proteins involved in the B-cell receptor
      signaling. Of these proteins, phosphoprotein associated with
      glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains 1 (PAG1) was identified with the most
      phosphorylated tyrosine peptides in Burkitt lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.
      PAG1 knockdown resulted in perturbation of the tyrosine phosphosignature of
      B-cell receptor signaling components. Significantly, PAG1 knockdown increased
      cell proliferation and response to antigen stimulation of these germinal
      center–derived B-NHLs. These data provide a detailed annotation of phosphorylated
      proteins in human lymphoid cancer. Overall, our study revealed the utility of
      unbiased phosphoproteome interrogation in characterizing signaling networks that 
      may provide insights into pathogenesis mechanisms in B-cell lymphomas.

PG  - e1260-
AB  - Lung cancer (LC) is a number one killer of cancer-related death among men and
      women worldwide. Major advances have been made in the diagnosis, staging and use 
      of surgery for LC, but systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy alone or in
      combination with some targeted agents remains the core treatment of advanced LC. 
      Unfortunately, in spite of improved diagnosis, surgical methods and new
      treatments, mortality is still extremely high among LC patients. To understand
      the precise functioning of signaling pathways associated with resistance to
      current treatments in LC, as well as to identify novel treatment regimens, a
      holistic approach to analyze signaling networks should be applied. Here, we
      describe systems biology-based approaches to generate biomarkers and novel
      therapeutic targets in LC, as well as how this may contribute to personalized
      treatment for this malignancy.

TI  - MAS promoter regulation: A role of Sry and tyrosine nitration of the KRAB domain 
      of ZNF274 as a feedback mechanism.
PG  - 727-38
AB  - The ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MAS axis of the renin-angiotensin system has emerged as a
      pathway of interest in treating both cardiovascular disorders and cancer. The MAS
      protein is known to bind to and be activated by Ang-(1-7); however mechanisms of 
      this activation are just starting to be understood. Whereas there are strong
      biochemical data regarding regulation and activation of the AT1 and AT2
      receptors, with models of how Ang II binds each receptor, fewer studies have
      characterized MAS. We characterize the MAS promoter and provide a potential
      feedback mechanism that would compensate for the MAS degradation following
      activation by Ang-(1-7). Analysis of ENCODE data for the MAS promoter revealed
      potential epigenetic control by KRAB/KAP1. A proximal promoter construct for the 
      MAS gene was repressed by the SOX proteins SRY, SOX2, SOX3, and SOX14, of which
      SRY is known to interact with the KRAB domain. The proteins KRAB/KAP1 can both be
      tyrosine nitrated, causing the dissociation of the KAP-1 protein, and thus a
      potential loss of epigenetic control. Activation of MAS can lead to an increase
      in nitric oxide, suggesting feedback mechanisms of MAS on its own promoter. These
      results present a more complete view of MAS regulation and for the first time
      suggest biochemical outcomes for nitration to the KRAB domain.

TI  - DNA-PK: a dynamic enzyme in a versatile DSB repair pathway.
PG  - 21-9
AB  - DNA double stranded breaks (DSBs) are the most cytoxic DNA lesion as the
      inability to properly repair them can lead to genomic instability and
      tumorigenesis. The prominent DSB repair pathway in humans is non-homologous
      end-joining (NHEJ). In the simplest sense, NHEJ mediates the direct re-ligation
      of the broken DNA molecule. However, NHEJ is a complex and versatile process that
      can repair DSBs with a variety of damages and ends via the utilization of a
      significant number of proteins. In this review we will describe the important
      factors and mechanisms modulating NHEJ with emphasis given to the versatility of 
      this repair process and the DNA-PK complex.

TI  - Signal Integration and Gene Induction by a Functionally Distinct STAT3
      Phosphoform.
PG  - 1800-11
AB  - Aberrant activation of the ubiquitous transcription factor STAT3 is a major
      driver of solid tumor progression and pathological angiogenesis. STAT3 activity
      is regulated by numerous posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including Tyr705
      phosphorylation, which is widely used as an indicator of canonical STAT3
      function. Here, we report a noncanonical mechanism of STAT3 activation that
      occurs independently of Tyr705 phosphorylation. Using quantitative liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, we have discovered and characterized a
      novel STAT3 phosphoform that is simultaneously phosphorylated at Thr714 and
      Ser727 by glycogen synthase kinase 3α and -β (GSK-3α/β). Both Thr714 and Ser727
      are required for STAT3-dependent gene induction in response to simultaneous
      activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and protease-activated
      receptor 1 (PAR-1) in endothelial cells. In this combinatorial signaling context,
      preventing formation of doubly phosphorylated STAT3 by depleting GSK-3α/β is
      sufficient to disrupt signal integration and inhibit STAT3-dependent gene
      expression. Levels of doubly phosphorylated STAT3 but not of
      Tyr705-phosphorylated STAT3 are remarkably elevated in clear-cell renal-cell
      carcinoma relative to adjacent normal tissue, suggesting that the GSK-3α/β–STAT3 
      pathway is active in the disease. Collectively, our results describe a
      functionally distinct, noncanonical STAT3 phosphoform that positively regulates
      target gene expression in a combinatorial signaling context and identify
      GSK-3α/β–STAT3 signaling as a potential therapeutic target in renal-cell
      carcinoma.

TI  - Identification of 2R-ohnologue gene families displaying the same mutation-load
      skew in multiple cancers.
LID - 140029
AB  - The complexity of signalling pathways was boosted at the origin of the
      vertebrates, when two rounds of whole genome duplication (2R-WGD) occurred. Those
      genes and proteins that have survived from the 2R-WGD—termed 2R-ohnologues—belong
      to families of two to four members, and are enriched in signalling components
      relevant to cancer. Here, we find that while only approximately 30% of human
      transcript-coding genes are 2R-ohnologues, they carry 42–60% of the gene
      mutations in 30 different cancer types. Across a subset of cancer datasets,
      including melanoma, breast, lung adenocarcinoma, liver and medulloblastoma, we
      identified 673 2R-ohnologue families in which one gene carries mutations at
      multiple positions, while sister genes in the same family are relatively mutation
      free. Strikingly, in 315 of the 322 2R-ohnologue families displaying such a skew 
      in multiple cancers, the same gene carries the heaviest mutation load in each
      cancer, and usually the second-ranked gene is also the same in each cancer. Our
      findings inspire the hypothesis that in certain cancers, heterogeneous
      combinations of genetic changes impair parts of the 2R-WGD signalling networks
      and force information flow through a limited set of oncogenic pathways in which
      specific non-mutated 2R-ohnologues serve as effectors. The non-mutated
      2R-ohnologues are therefore potential therapeutic targets. These include proteins
      linked to growth factor signalling, neurotransmission and ion channels.

TI  - Inhibition of KRAS-driven tumorigenicity by interruption of an autocrine cytokine
      circuit.
PG  - 452-65
AB  - Although the roles of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and
      phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling in KRAS-driven tumorigenesis are
      well established, KRAS activates additional pathways required for tumor
      maintenance, inhibition of which are likely to be necessary for effective
      KRAS-directed therapy. Here we show that the IKK-related kinases TBK1 and IKKε
      promote KRAS-driven tumorigenesis by regulating autocrine CCL5 and IL-6 and
      identify CYT387 as a potent JAK/TBK1/IKKε inhibitor. CYT387 treatment ablates
      RAS-associated cytokine signaling and impairs Kras-driven murine lung cancer
      growth. Combined CYT387 and MEK inhibitor therapy induces regression of
      aggressive murine lung adenocarcinomas driven by Kras mutation and p53 loss.
      These observations reveal that TBK1/IKKε promote tumor survival by activating
      CCL5 and IL-6 and identify concurrent inhibition of TBK1/IKKε, JAK, and MEK
      signaling as an effective approach to inhibit the actions of oncogenic KRAS.

TI  - Protected Amine Labels: A Versatile Molecular Scaffold for Multiplexed Nominal
      Mass and Sub-Da Isotopologue Quantitative Proteomic Reagents.
PG  - 636-50
AB  - We assemble a versatile molecular scaffold from simple building blocks to create 
      binary and multiplexed stable isotope reagents for quantitative mass
      spectrometry. Termed Protected Amine Labels (PAL), these reagents offer multiple 
      analytical figures of merit including, (i) robust targeting of peptide N-termini 
      and lysyl side chains, (ii) optimal mass spectrometry ionization efficiency
      through regeneration of primary amines on labeled peptides, (iii) an amino
      acid-based mass tag that incorporates heavy isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and
      oxygen to ensure matched physicochemical and MS/MS fragmentation behavior among
      labeled peptides, and (iv) a molecularly efficient architecture, in which the
      majority of hetero-atom centers can be used to synthesize a variety of nominal
      mass and sub-Da isotopologue stable isotope reagents. We demonstrate the
      performance of these reagents in well-established strategies whereby up to four
      channels of peptide isotopomers, each separated by 4 Da are quantified in
      MS-level scans with accuracies comparable to current commercial reagents. In
      addition we utilize the PAL scaffold to create isotopologue reagents in which
      labeled peptide analogs differ in mass based on the binding energy in carbon and 
      nitrogen nuclei, thereby allowing quantification based on MS or MS/MS spectra. We
      demonstrate accurate quantification for reagents that support 6-plex labeling and
      propose extension of this scheme to 9-channels based on a similar PAL scaffold.
      Finally we provide exemplar data that extends the application of
      isotopologe-based quantification reagents to medium resolution, quadrupole
      time-of-flight mass spectrometers.

TI  - Mass Spectrometry-Based Quantitative Proteomics for Dissecting Multiplexed Redox 
      Cysteine Modifications in Nitric Oxide-Protected Cardiomyocyte Under Hypoxia.
PG  - 1365-81
AB  - Aims: Distinctive states of redox-dependent cysteine (Cys) modifications are
      known to regulate signaling homeostasis under various pathophysiological
      conditions, including myocardial injury or protection in response to ischemic
      stress. Recent evidence further implicates a dynamic interplay among these
      modified forms following changes in cellular redox environment. However, a
      precise delineation of multiplexed Cys modifications in a cellular context
      remains technically challenging. To this end, we have now developed a mass
      spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative approach using a set of novel
      iodoacetyl-based Cys-reactive isobaric tags (irreversible isobaric iodoacetyl
      Cys-reactive tandem mass tag [iodoTMT]) endowed with unique irreversible
      Cys-reactivities. Results: We have established a sequential iodoTMT-switch
      procedure coupled with efficient immunoenrichment and advanced shotgun liquid
      chromatography-MS/MS analysis. This workflow allows us to differentially quantify
      the multiple redox-modified forms of a Cys site in the original cellular context.
      In one single analysis, we have identified over 260 Cys sites showing
      quantitative differences in multiplexed redox modifications from the total
      lysates of H9c2 cardiomyocytes experiencing hypoxia in the absence and presence
      of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), indicative of a distinct pattern of individual
      susceptibility to S-nitrosylation or S-glutathionylation. Among those most
      significantly affected are proteins functionally implicated in hypoxic damage
      from which we showed that GSNO would protect. Innovation: We demonstrate for the 
      first time how quantitative analysis of various Cys-redox modifications occurring
      in biological samples can be performed precisely and simultaneously at proteomic 
      levels. Conclusion: We have not only developed a new approach to map global
      Cys-redoxomic regulation in vivo, but also provided new evidences implicating
      Cys-redox modifications of key molecules in NO-mediated ischemic
      cardioprotection. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 20, 1365–1381.

TI  - β-arrestin-1 mediates the TCR-triggered re-routing of distal receptors to the
      immunological synapse by a PKC-mediated mechanism.
PG  - 559-77
AB  - T-cell receptors (TCR) recognize their antigen ligand at the interface between T 
      cells and antigen-presenting cells, known as the immunological synapse (IS). The 
      IS provides a means of sustaining the TCR signal which requires the continual
      supply of new TCRs. These are endocytosed and redirected from distal membrane
      locations to the IS. In our search for novel cytoplasmic effectors, we have
      identified β-arrestin-1 as a ligand of non-phosphorylated resting TCRs. Using
      dominant-negative and knockdown approaches we demonstrate that β-arrestin-1 is
      required for the internalization and downregulation of non-engaged bystander
      TCRs. Furthermore, TCR triggering provokes the β-arrestin-1-mediated
      downregulation of the G-protein coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4, but not of
      other control receptors. We demonstrate that β-arrestin-1 recruitment to the TCR,
      and bystander TCR and CXCR4 downregulation, are mechanistically mediated by the
      TCR-triggered PKC-mediated phosphorylation of β-arrestin-1 at Ser163. This
      mechanism allows the first triggered TCRs to deliver a stop migration signal, and
      to promote the internalization of distal TCRs and CXCR4 and their translocation
      to the IS. This receptor crosstalk mechanism is critical to sustain the TCR
      signal.

TI  - Nutrient sensing and signaling in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 254-99
AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been a favorite organism for pioneering
      studies on nutrient-sensing and signaling mechanisms. Many specific nutrient
      responses have been elucidated in great detail. This has led to important new
      concepts and insight into nutrient-controlled cellular regulation. Major
      highlights include the central role of the Snf1 protein kinase in the glucose
      repression pathway, galactose induction, the discovery of a G-protein-coupled
      receptor system, and role of Ras in glucose-induced cAMP signaling, the role of
      the protein synthesis initiation machinery in general control of nitrogen
      metabolism, the cyclin-controlled protein kinase Pho85 in phosphate regulation,
      nitrogen catabolite repression and the nitrogen-sensing target of rapamycin
      pathway, and the discovery of transporter-like proteins acting as nutrient
      sensors. In addition, a number of cellular targets, like carbohydrate stores,
      stress tolerance, and ribosomal gene expression, are controlled by the presence
      of multiple nutrients. The protein kinase A signaling pathway plays a major role 
      in this general nutrient response. It has led to the discovery of nutrient
      transceptors (transporter receptors) as nutrient sensors. Major shortcomings in
      our knowledge are the relationship between rapid and steady-state nutrient
      signaling, the role of metabolic intermediates in intracellular nutrient sensing,
      and the identity of the nutrient sensors controlling cellular growth.

TI  - Synaptic activity bidirectionally regulates a novel sequence-specific S-Q
      phosphoproteome in neurons.
PG  - 841-51
AB  - Protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in neuronal transcription,
      translation, cell viability, and synaptic plasticity. In neurons, phospho-enzymes
      and specific substrates directly link glutamate release and post-synaptic
      depolarization to these cellular functions; however, many of these enzymes and
      their protein substrates remain uncharacterized or unidentified. In this article,
      we identify a novel, synaptically-driven neuronal phosphoproteome characterized
      by a specific motif of serine/threonine-glutamine ([S/T]-Q, abbreviated as SQ).
      These SQ-containing substrates are predominantly localized to dendrites,
      synapses, the soma; and activation of this SQ phosphoproteome by bicuculline
      application is induced via calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. On the
      other hand, acute application of NMDA can inactivate this SQ phosphoproteome. We 
      demonstrate that the SQ motif kinase Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) can also
      localize to dendrites and dendritic spines, in addition to other subcellular
      compartments, and is activated by bicuculline application. Pharmacology studies
      indicate that ATM and its sister kinase ATR up-regulate these neuronal SQ
      substrates. Phosphoproteomics identified over 150 SQ-containing substrates whose 
      phosphorylation is bidirectionally-regulated by synaptic activity.

TI  - The AMPK inhibitor Compound C is a potent AMPK-independent anti-glioma agent.
PG  - 596-605
AB  - AMPK is an evolutionarily conserved energy sensor important for cell growth,
      proliferation, survival and metabolic regulation. Active AMPK inhibits
      biosynthetic enzymes like mTOR and acetyl CoA carboxylase (required for protein
      and lipid synthesis, respectively) to ensure that cells maintain essential
      nutrients and energy during metabolic crisis. Despite our knowledge about this
      incredibly important kinase, no specific chemical inhibitors are available to
      examine its function. However, one small molecule known as Compound C (also
      called dorsomorphin) has been widely used in cell-based, biochemical and in vivo 
      assays as a selective AMPK inhibitor. In nearly all these reports including a
      recent study in glioma, the biochemical and cellular effects of Compound C has
      been attributed to its inhibitory action towards AMPK. While examining the status
      of AMPK activation in human gliomas, we observed that glioblastomas (GBMs)
      express copious amount of active AMPK. Compound C effectively reduced glioma
      viability in vitro both by inhibiting proliferation and inducing cell death. As
      expected, Compound C inhibited AMPK; however, all the antiproliferative effects
      of this compound were AMPK-independent. Instead, Compound C killed glioma cells
      by multiple mechanisms including activation of the Calpain/Cathepsin pathway,
      inhibition of AKT, mTORC1/C2, cell cycle block at G2M and induction of
      necroptosis and autophagy. Importantly, normal astrocytes were significantly less
      susceptible to Compound C. In summary, Compound C is an extremely potent
      anti-glioma agent but we suggest that caution should be taken in interpreting
      results when this compound is used as an AMPK inhibitor.

TI  - MEK-Dependent Negative Feedback Underlies BCR-ABL-Mediated Oncogene Addiction.
PG  - 200-15
AB  - The clinical experience with BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the
      treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) provides compelling evidence for
      oncogene addiction. Yet, the molecular basis of oncogene addiction remains
      elusive. Through unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomic analyses of CML cells
      transiently exposed to BCR-ABL TKI, we identified persistent downregulation of
      growth factor receptor (GF-R) signaling pathways. We then established and
      validated a tissue-relevant isogenic model of BCR-ABL-mediated addiction, and
      found evidence for myeloid GF-R signaling pathway rewiring that profoundly and
      persistently dampens physiologic pathway activation. We demonstrate that eventual
      restoration of ligand-mediated GF-R pathway activation is insufficient to fully
      rescue cells from a competing apoptotic fate. In contrast to previous work with
      BRAFV600E in melanoma cells, feedback inhibition following BCR-ABL TKI treatment 
      is markedly prolonged, extending beyond the time required to initiate apoptosis. 
      Mechanistically, BCR-ABL-mediated oncogene addiction is facilitated by persistent
      high levels of MEK-dependent negative feedback.

TI  - Identification of Peroxiredoxin-5 in Bovine Cauda Epididymal Sperm.
PG  - 113-21
AB  - Developing spermatozoa require a series of post-testicular modifications within
      the luminal environment of the epididymis to achieve maturation; this involves
      several surface modifications including changes in plasma membrane lipids,
      proteins, carbohydrates, and alterations in the outer acrosomal membrane.
      Epididymal maturation can therefore allow sperm to gain forward motility and
      fertilization capabilities. The objective of this study was to identify
      maturation dependent protein(s) and to investigate their role with the production
      of functionally competent spermatozoa. Lectin blot analyses of caput and cauda
      sperm plasma membrane fractions identified a 17.5kDa Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) 
      binding polypeptide present in the cauda sperm plasma membrane not in the caput
      sperm plasma membrane. Among the several WGA stained bands, the presence of a
      17.5kDa WGA binding polypeptide band was detected only in cauda epididymal fluid 
      not in caput epididymal fluid suggesting that the 17.5kDa WGA-binding polypeptide
      is secreted from the cauda epididymis and binds to the cauda sperm plasma
      membrane during epididymal transit. Proteomic identification of the 17.5kDa
      polypeptide yielded 13 peptides that matched the sequence of peroxiredoxin-5
      (PRDX5) protein (Bos Taurus). We propose that bovine cauda sperm PRDX5 acts as an
      antioxidant enzyme in the epididymal environment, which is crucial in protecting 
      the viable sperm population against the damage caused by endogeneous or
      exogeneous peroxide.

TI  - Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Protein Phosphorylation Networks in Tetrahymena
      thermophila, a Model Single-celled Organism*.
PG  - 503-19
AB  - Tetrahymena thermophila is a widely used unicellular eukaryotic model organism in
      biological research and contains more than 1000 protein kinases and phosphatases 
      with specificity for Ser/Thr/Tyr residues. However, only a few dozen
      phosphorylation sites in T. thermophila are known, presenting a major obstacle to
      further understanding of the regulatory roles of reversible phosphorylation in
      this organism. In this study, we used high-accuracy mass-spectrometry-based
      proteomics to conduct global and site-specific phosphoproteome profiling of T.
      thermophila. In total, 1384 phosphopeptides and 2238 phosphorylation sites from
      1008 T. thermophila proteins were identified through the combined use of peptide 
      prefractionation, TiO2 enrichment, and two-dimensional LC-MS/MS analysis. The
      identified phosphoproteins are implicated in the regulation of various biological
      processes such as transport, gene expression, and mRNA metabolic process.
      Moreover, integrated analysis of the T. thermophila phosphoproteome and gene
      network revealed the potential biological functions of many previously
      unannotated proteins and predicted some putative kinase–substrate pairs. Our data
      provide the first global survey of phosphorylation in T. thermophila using a
      phosphoproteomic approach and suggest a wide-ranging regulatory scope of this
      modification. The provided dataset is a valuable resource for the future
      understanding of signaling pathways in this important model organism.

AB  - Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism for optimal growth and survival.
      AMPK-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key energy sensor that controls many
      metabolic pathways including metabolic reprogramming. However, its role in cancer
      is poorly understood. Some studies claim that it has a tumor suppressor role
      while others show its protumor role. Two AMPK-activating compounds (including
      metformin, now in many clinical trials) are widely used to suppress cancer cell
      proliferation. We found that AMPK is abundantly expressed in high-grade gliomas
      and, in contrast to popular belief, these two AMPK activators suppressed glioma
      cell proliferation through unique AMPK-independent mechanisms.

TI  - In vivo cleaved CDCP1 promotes early tumor dissemination via complexing with
      activated β1 integrin and induction of FAK/PI3K/Akt motility signaling.
PG  - 255-68
AB  - Specific cleavage of the transmembrane molecule, CUB domain-containing protein-1 
      (CDCP1), by plasmin-like serine proteases induces outside–in signal transduction 
      that facilitates early stages of spontaneous metastasis leading to tumor cell
      intravasation, namely cell escape from the primary tumor, stromal invasion and
      transendothelial migration. We identified active β1 integrin as a biochemical and
      functional partner of the membrane-retained 70-kDa CDCP1 fragment, newly
      generated from its full-length 135-kDa precursor though proteolytic cleavage by
      serine proteases. Both in cell cultures and in live animals, active β1 integrin
      complexed preferentially with functionally activated, phosphorylated 70-kDa
      CDCP1. Complexing of β1 integrin the 70-kDa with CDCP1 fragment induced
      intracellular phosphorylation signaling, involving focal adhesion kinase-1 (FAK) 
      and PI3 kinase (PI3K)-dependent Akt activation. Thus, inhibition of FAK/PI3K
      activities by specific inhibitors as well as short-hairpin RNA downregulation of 
      β1 integrin significantly reduced FAK/Akt phosphorylation under conditions where 
      CDCP1 was processed by serine proteases, indicating that FAK/PI3K/Akt pathway
      operates downstream of cleaved CDCP1 complexed with β1 integrin. Furthermore,
      this complex-dependent signaling correlated positively with high levels of tumor 
      cell intravasation and dissemination. Correspondingly, abrogation in vivo of
      CDCP1 cleavage either by unique cleavage-blocking monoclonal antibody 10-D7 or by
      inhibition of proteolytic activity of plasmin-like serine proteases with
      aprotinin prevented β1 integrin/CDCP1 complexing and downstream FAK/Akt signaling
      concomitant with significant reduction of stromal invasion and spontaneous
      metastasis. Therefore, β1 integrin appears to serve as a motility-regulating
      partner mediating cross-talk between proteolytically cleaved, membrane-retained
      CDCP1 and members of FAK/PI3K/Akt pathway. This CDCP1 cleavage-induced signaling 
      cascade constitutes a unique mechanism, independent of extracellular matrix
      remodeling, whereby a proteolytically cleaved CDCP1 regulates in vivo locomotion 
      and metastasis of tumor cells through β1 integrin partnering. Our findings
      indicate that CDCP1 cleavage, occurring at the apex of a β1 integrin/FAK/PI3K/Akt
      signaling cascade, may represent a therapeutic target for CDCP1-positive cancers.

TI  - Parkinson-related LRRK2 mutation R1441C/G/H impairs PKA phosphorylation of LRRK2 
      and disrupts its interaction with 14-3-3.
PG  - E34-43
AB  - Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a multidomain protein implicated in
      Parkinson disease, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) has been suggested to 
      act as an upstream kinase phosphorylating LRRK2. Using a phosphoproteomics
      approach, we identified several novel PKA phosphorylation sites on LRRK2. We
      could demonstrate that one PKA phosphosite comprises the second most common
      mutation in LRRK2 (R1441C/G/H) attributed to Parkinson disease. Our findings
      reveal that this site is mandatory for subsequent 14-3-3 binding and affects
      LRRK2 kinase activity. These data provide a mechanistic insight into the
      regulation of LRRK2 kinase activity and its perturbation by disease-associated
      mutations.

TI  - Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Gossypol-Induced Apoptosis in Ovarian Cancer Cell
      Line, HOC1a.
LID - 123482
AB  - Ovarian cancer is a major cause for death of gynecological cancer patients. The
      efficacy of traditional surgery and chemotherapy is rather compromised and
      platinum-resistant cancer recurs. Finding new therapeutic targets is urgently
      needed to increase the survival rate and to improve life quality of patients with
      ovarian cancer. In the present work, phosphoproteomic analysis was carried out on
      untreated and gossypol-treated ovarian cancer cell line, HOC1a. We identified
      approximately 9750 phosphopeptides from 3030 phosphoproteins, which are involved 
      in diverse cellular processes including cytoskeletal organization, RNA and
      nucleotide binding, and cell cycle regulation. Upon gossypol treatment, changes
      in phosphorylation of twenty-nine proteins including YAP1 and AKAP12 were
      characterized. Western blotting and qPCR analysis were used to determine
      expression levels of proteins in YAP1-related Hippo pathway showing that gossypol
      induced upregulation of LATS1, which phosphorylates YAP1 at Ser 61. Furthermore, 
      our data showed that gossypol targets the actin cytoskeletal organization through
      mediating phosphorylation states of actin-binding proteins. Taken together, our
      data provide valuable information to understand effects of gossypol on protein
      phosphorylation and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells.

TI  - Profiling the tyrosine phosphoproteome of different mouse mammary tumour models
      reveals distinct, model-specific signalling networks and conserved oncogenic
      pathways.
LID - 437
AB  - Introduction: Although aberrant tyrosine kinase signalling characterises
      particular breast cancer subtypes, a global analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation 
      in mouse models of breast cancer has not been undertaken to date. This may
      identify conserved oncogenic pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Methods:
      We applied an immunoaffinity/mass spectrometry workflow to three mouse models:
      murine stem cell virus-Neu, expressing truncated Neu, the rat orthologue of human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2, Her2 (HER2); mouse mammary tumour
      virus-polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyMT); and the p53−/− transplant model
      (p53). Pathways and protein–protein interaction networks were identified by
      bioinformatics analysis. Molecular mechanisms underpinning differences in
      tyrosine phosphorylation were characterised by Western blot analysis and array
      comparative genomic hybridisation. The functional role of mesenchymal–epithelial 
      transition factor (Met) in a subset of p53-null tumours was interrogated using a 
      selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), small interfering RNA (siRNA)–mediated
      knockdown and cell proliferation assays. Results: The three models could be
      distinguished on the basis of tyrosine phosphorylation signatures and signalling 
      networks. HER2 tumours exhibited a protein–protein interaction network centred on
      avian erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 2 (Erbb2), epidermal
      growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, and they
      displayed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor
      1. In contrast, the PyMT network displayed significant enrichment for components 
      of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling pathway, whereas p53 tumours
      exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Met and components or regulators 
      of the cytoskeleton and shared signalling network characteristics with basal and 
      claudin-low breast cancer cells. A subset of p53 tumours displayed markedly
      elevated cellular tyrosine phosphorylation and Met expression, as well as Met
      gene amplification. Treatment of cultured p53-null cells exhibiting Met
      amplification with a selective Met TKI abrogated aberrant tyrosine
      phosphorylation and blocked cell proliferation. The effects on proliferation were
      recapitulated when Met was knocked down using siRNA. Additional subtypes of p53
      tumours exhibited increased tyrosine phosphorylation of other oncogenes,
      including Peak1/SgK269 and Prex2. Conclusion: This study provides network-level
      insights into signalling in the breast cancer models utilised and demonstrates
      that comparative phosphoproteomics can identify conserved oncogenic signalling
      pathways. The Met-amplified, p53-null tumours provide a new preclinical model for
      a subset of triple-negative breast cancers. Electronic supplementary material:

TI  - Integrating Omics Technologies to Study Pulmonary Physiology and Pathology at the
      Systems Level.
PG  - 1239-60
AB  - Assimilation and integration of “omics” technologies, including genomics,
      epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics has readily altered the landscape of
      medical research in the last decade. The vast and complex nature of omics data
      can only be interpreted by linking molecular information at the organismic level,
      forming the foundation of systems biology. Research in pulmonary biology/medicine
      has necessitated integration of omics, network, systems and computational biology
      data to differentially diagnose, interpret, and prognosticate pulmonary diseases,
      facilitating improvement in therapy and treatment modalities. This review
      describes how to leverage this emerging technology in understanding pulmonary
      diseases at the systems level –called a “systomic” approach. Considering the
      operational wholeness of cellular and organ systems, diseased genome, proteome,
      and the metabolome needs to be conceptualized at the systems level to understand 
      disease pathogenesis and progression. Currently available omics technology and
      resources require a certain degree of training and proficiency in addition to
      dedicated hardware and applications, making them relatively less user friendly
      for the pulmonary biologist and clinicians. Herein, we discuss the various
      strategies, computational tools and approaches required to study pulmonary
      diseases at the systems level for biomedical scientists and clinical researchers.

TI  - Inflammatory stress and sarcomagenesis: a vicious interplay.
PG  - 1-13
AB  - Chronic inflammation represents one of the hallmarks of cancer, but its role in
      sarcomagenesis has long been overlooked. Sarcomas are a rare and heterogeneous
      group of tumors of mesenchymal origin accounting for less than 1 % of cancers in 
      adults but 21 % of cancers in the pediatric population. Sarcomas are associated
      with bad prognosis, and their management requires a multidisciplinary team
      approach. Several lines of evidence indicate that inflammation has been
      implicated in sarcomagenesis leading to the activation of the key transcription
      factors HIF-1, NF- κB, and STAT-3 involved in a complex inflammatory network. In 
      the past years, an increasing number of new targets have been identified in the
      treatment of sarcomas leading to the development of new drugs that aim to
      interrupt the vicious connection between inflammation and sarcomagenesis. This
      article makes a brief overview of preclinical and clinical evidence of the
      molecular pathways involved in the inflammatory stress response in sarcomagenesis
      and the most targeted therapies.

TI  - Green fluorescent protein expression triggers proteome changes in breast cancer
      cells.
LID - 10.1016/j.yexcr.2013.07.019
AB  - Green fluorescent protein (GFP) is the most commonly used reporter of expression 
      in cell biology despite evidence that it affects the cell physiology. The
      molecular mechanism of GFP-associated modifications has been largely unexplored. 
      In this paper we investigated the proteome modifications following stable
      expression of GFP in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). A combination of three
      different proteome analysis methods (2-DE, iTRAQ, label-free) was used to
      maximise proteome coverage. We found that GFP expression induces changes in
      expression of proteins that are associated with protein folding, cytoskeletal
      organisation and cellular immune response. In view of these findings, the use of 
      GFP as a cell reporter should be carefully monitored.

TI  - Discoidin domain receptor functions in physiological and pathological conditions.
PG  - 39-87
AB  - The discoidin domain receptors, DDR1 and DDR2, are non-integrin collagen
      receptors that are members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. Both DDRs bind
      a number of different collagen types and play important roles in embryo
      development. Dysregulated DDR function is associated with progression of various 
      human diseases, including fibrosis, arthritis and cancer. By interacting with key
      components of the extracellular matrix and displaying distinct activation
      kinetics, the DDRs form a unique subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases.
      DDR-facilitated cellular functions include cell migration, cell survival,
      proliferation and differentiation, as well as remodelling of extracellular
      matrices. This review summarises the current knowledge of DDR-ligand
      interactions, DDR-initiated signal pathways and the molecular mechanisms that
      regulate receptor function. Also discussed are the roles of DDRs in development
      and disease progression.

LID - 962962
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) is a well characterized growth factor among
      the 22 members of the FGF superfamily in humans. It binds to all the four known
      FGF receptors and regulates a plethora of functions including cell growth,
      proliferation, migration, differentiation, and survival in different cell types. 
      FGF-1 is involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes such as
      development, angiogenesis, wound healing, adipogenesis, and neurogenesis.
      Deregulation of FGF-1 signaling is not only implicated in tumorigenesis but also 
      is associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Given the biomedical
      significance of FGFs and the fact that individual FGFs have different roles in
      diverse physiological processes, the analysis of signaling pathways induced by
      the binding of specific FGFs to their cognate receptors demands more focused
      efforts. Currently, there are no resources in the public domain that facilitate
      the analysis of signaling pathways induced by individual FGFs in the FGF/FGFR
      signaling system. Towards this, we have developed a resource of signaling
      reactions triggered by FGF-1/FGFR system in various cell types/tissues. The
      pathway data and the reaction map are made available for download in different
      community standard data exchange formats through NetPath and NetSlim signaling
      pathway resources.

TI  - Transforming Growth Factor β Regulates P-Body Formation through Induction of the 
      mRNA Decay Factor Tristetraprolin.
PG  - 180-95
AB  - Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is a potent growth regulator and tumor
      suppressor in normal intestinal epithelium. Likewise, epithelial cell growth is
      controlled by rapid decay of growth-related mRNAs mediated through 3′
      untranslated region (UTR) AU-rich element (ARE) motifs. We demonstrate that
      treatment of nontransformed intestinal epithelial cells with TGF-β inhibited
      ARE-mRNA expression. This effect of TGF-β was promoted through increased assembly
      of cytoplasmic RNA processing (P) bodies where ARE-mRNA localization was
      observed. P-body formation was dependent on TGF-β/Smad signaling, as Smad3
      deletion abrogated P-body formation. In concert with increased P-body formation, 
      TGF-β induced expression of the ARE-binding protein tristetraprolin (TTP), which 
      colocalized to P bodies. TTP expression was necessary for TGF-β-dependent P-body 
      formation and promoted growth inhibition by TGF-β. The significance of this was
      observed in vivo, where colonic epithelium deficient in TGF-β/Smad signaling or
      TTP expression showed attenuated P-body levels. These results provide new insight
      into TGF-β's antiproliferative properties and identify TGF-β as a novel mRNA
      stability regulator in intestinal epithelium through its ability to promote TTP
      expression and subsequent P-body formation.

TI  - Comprehensive Quantitative Comparison of the Membrane Proteome, Phosphoproteome, 
      and Sialiome of Human Embryonic and Neural Stem Cells*.
PG  - 311-28
AB  - Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can differentiate into neural stem cells
      (NSCs), which can further be differentiated into neurons and glia cells.
      Therefore, these cells have huge potential as source for treatment of
      neurological diseases. Membrane-associated proteins are very important in
      cellular signaling and recognition, and their function and activity are
      frequently regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation 
      and glycosylation. To obtain information about membrane-associated proteins and
      their modified amino acids potentially involved in changes of hESCs and NSCs as
      well as to investigate potential new markers for these two cell stages, we
      performed large-scale quantitative membrane-proteomic of hESCs and NSCs. This
      approach employed membrane purification followed by peptide dimethyl labeling and
      peptide enrichment to study the membrane subproteome as well as changes in
      phosphorylation and sialylation between hESCs and NSCs. Combining proteomics and 
      modification specific proteomics we identified a total of 5105 proteins whereof
      57% contained transmembrane domains or signal peptides. The enrichment strategy
      yielded a total of 10,087 phosphorylated peptides in which 78% of phosphopeptides
      were identified with ≥99% confidence in site assignment and 1810 unique formerly 
      sialylated N-linked glycopeptides. Several proteins were identified as
      significantly regulated in hESCs and NSC, including proteins involved in the
      early embryonic and neural development. In the latter group of proteins, we could
      identify potential NSC markers as Crumbs 2 and several novel proteins. A motif
      analysis of the altered phosphosites showed a sequence consensus motif
      (R-X-XpS/T) significantly up-regulated in NSC. This motif is among other kinases 
      recognized by the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-2, emphasizing a possible
      importance of this kinase for this cell stage. Collectively, this data represent 
      the most diverse set of post-translational modifications reported for hESCs and
      NSCs. This study revealed potential markers to distinguish NSCs from hESCs and
      will contribute to improve our understanding on the differentiation process.

TI  - Rule-based modeling: a computational approach for studying biomolecular site
      dynamics in cell signaling systems.
PG  - 13-36
AB  - Rule-based modeling was developed to address the limitations of traditional
      approaches for modeling chemical kinetics in cell signaling systems. These
      systems consist of multiple interacting biomolecules (e.g., proteins), which
      themselves consist of multiple parts (e.g., domains, linear motifs, and sites of 
      phosphorylation). Consequently, biomolecules that mediate information processing 
      generally have the potential to interact in multiple ways, with the number of
      possible complexes and post-translational modification states tending to grow
      exponentially with the number of binary interactions considered. As a result,
      only large reaction networks capture all possible consequences of the molecular
      interactions that occur in a cell signaling system, which is problematic because 
      traditional modeling approaches for chemical kinetics (e.g., ordinary
      differential equations) require explicit network specification. This problem is
      circumvented through representation of interactions in terms of local rules. With
      this approach, network specification is implicit and model specification is
      concise. Concise representation results in a coarse graining of chemical
      kinetics, which is introduced because all reactions implied by a rule inherit the
      rate law associated with that rule. Coarse graining can be appropriate if
      interactions are modular, and the coarseness of a model can be adjusted as
      needed. Rules can be specified using specialized model-specification languages,
      and recently developed tools designed for specification of rule-based models
      allow one to leverage powerful software engineering capabilities. A rule-based
      model comprises a set of rules, which can be processed by general-purpose
      simulation and analysis tools to achieve different objectives (e.g., to perform
      either a deterministic or stochastic simulation).

TI  - Sestrins orchestrate cellular metabolism to attenuate aging.
LID - 10.1016/j.cmet.2013.08.018
AB  - The Sestrins constitute a family of evolutionarily-conserved stress-inducible
      proteins that suppress oxidative stress and regulate adenosine
      monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (AMPK)-mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) signaling. By virtue of these activities, the Sestrins serve as important 
      regulators of metabolic homeostasis. Accordingly, inactivation of Sestrin genes
      in invertebrates resulted in diverse metabolic pathologies, including oxidative
      damage, fat accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and muscle degeneration that 
      resemble accelerated tissue aging. Likewise, Sestrin deficiencies in mice led to 
      accelerated diabetic progression upon obesity. Further investigation of Sestrin
      function and regulation should provide new insights into age-associated metabolic
      diseases, such as diabetes, myopathies and cancer.

AB  - The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is one of the most frequently
      mutated pathways in cancer, and is actively being pursued as a therapeutic
      target. Despite the importance of the PI3K pathway in cancer, durable responses
      to PI3K-pathway targeted therapies are uncommon with monotherapy. Several in
      vitro and xenograft models have elucidated compensatory signaling and genomic
      changes which may limit the therapeutic effectiveness of PI3K inhibitors in the
      clinic. Future clinical trials with prospective evaluation of tumor signaling and
      genomic changes are likely to identify novel resistance mechanisms as well as
      subsets of patients who may derive maximal benefit from PI3K pathway inhibitors.

TI  - Combining docking site and phosphosite predictions to find new substrates:
      Identification of Smoothelin-like-2 (SMTNL2) as a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
      substrate.
PG  - 2518-29
AB  - Specific docking interactions between mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), 
      their regulators, and their downstream substrates, are crucial for efficient and 
      accurate signal transmission. To identify novel substrates of the c-Jun
      N-terminal kinase (JNK) family of MAPKs, we searched the human genome for
      proteins that contained (1), a predicted JNK-docking site (D-site); and (2), a
      cluster of putative JNK target phosphosites located close to the D-site. Here we 
      describe a novel JNK substrate that emerged from this analysis, the functionally 
      uncharacterized protein Smoothelin-like 2 (SMTNL2). SMTNL2 protein bound with
      high-affinity to multiple MAPKs including JNK1-3 and ERK2; furthermore, the
      identity of conserved amino acids in the predicted docking site (residues
      180-193) was necessary for this high-affinity binding. In addition, purified
      full-length SMTNL2 protein was phosphorylated by JNK1-3 in vitro, and this
      required the integrity of the D-site. Using mass spectrometry and mutagenesis, we
      identified four D-site-dependent phosphoacceptor sites in close proximity to the 
      docking site, at S217, S241, T236 and T239. A short peptide comprised of the
      SMTNL2 D-site inhibited JNK-mediated phosphorylation of the ATF2 transcription
      factor, showing that SMTNL2 can compete with other substrates for JNK binding.
      Moreover, when transfected into HEK293 cells, SMTNL2 was phosphorylated by
      endogenous JNK in a D-site dependent manner, on the same residues identified in
      vitro. SMTNL2 protein was expressed in many mammalian tissues, with notably high 
      expression in skeletal muscle. Consistent with the hypothesis that SMTNL2 has a
      function in skeletal muscle, SMTNL2 protein expression was strongly induced
      during the transition from myoblasts to myotubes in differentiating C2C12 cells.

LID - 10.1007/s10157-013-0789-5
AB  - Water excretion is regulated in large part through the regulation of the osmotic 
      water permeability of the renal collecting duct epithelium. The water
      permeability is controlled by vasopressin through regulation of the water
      channel, aquaporin-2 (AQP2). Two processes contribute: 1) regulation of AQP2
      trafficking to the apical plasma membrane; and 2) regulation of the total amount 
      of the AQP2 protein in the cells. Regulation of AQP2 abundance is defective in
      several water balance disorders including many polyuric disorders and the
      syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIADH). Here we review vasopressin
      signaling in the renal collecting duct that is relevant to the two modes of water
      permeability regulation.

TI  - Dynamic feedback circuits function as a switch for shaping a maturation-inducing 
      steroid pulse in Drosophila.
PG  - 4730-9
AB  - Steroid hormones trigger the onset of sexual maturation in animals by initiating 
      genetic response programs that are determined by steroid pulse frequency,
      amplitude and duration. Although steroid pulses coordinate growth and timing of
      maturation during development, the mechanisms generating these pulses are not
      known. Here we show that the ecdysone steroid pulse that drives the
      juvenile-adult transition in Drosophila is determined by feedback circuits in the
      prothoracic gland (PG), the major steroid-producing tissue of insect larvae.
      These circuits coordinate the activation and repression of hormone synthesis, the
      two key parameters determining pulse shape (amplitude and duration). We show that
      ecdysone has a positive-feedback effect on the PG, rapidly amplifying its own
      synthesis to trigger pupariation as the onset of maturation. During the prepupal 
      stage, a negative-feedback signal ensures the decline in ecdysone levels required
      to produce a temporal steroid pulse that drives developmental progression to
      adulthood. The feedback circuits rely on a developmental switch in the expression
      of Broad isoforms that transcriptionally activate or silence components in the
      ecdysone biosynthetic pathway. Remarkably, our study shows that the same
      well-defined genetic program that stimulates a systemic downstream response to
      ecdysone is also utilized upstream to set the duration and amplitude of the
      ecdysone pulse. Activation of this switch-like mechanism ensures a rapid,
      self-limiting PG response that functions in producing steroid oscillations that
      can guide the decision to terminate growth and promote maturation.

AB  - Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common post-translational
      modifications used in signal transduction to control cell growth, proliferation, 
      and survival in response to both intracellular and extracellular stimuli. This
      modification is finely coordinated by a network of kinases and phosphatases that 
      recognize unique sequence motifs and/or mediate their functions through scaffold 
      and adaptor proteins. Detailed information on the nature of kinase substrates and
      site-specific phosphoregulation is required in order for one to better understand
      their pathophysiological roles. Recent advances in affinity chromatography and
      mass spectrometry (MS) sensitivity have enabled the large-scale identification
      and profiling of protein phosphorylation, but appropriate follow-up experiments
      are required in order to ascertain the functional significance of identified
      phosphorylation sites. In this review, we present meaningful technical details
      for MS-based phosphoproteomic analyses and describe important considerations for 
      the selection of model systems and the functional characterization of identified 
      phosphorylation sites.

      Modulate Human Microvascular Endothelial Signaling in a Three-Dimensional Matrix 
      Migration Context*.
PG  - 3704-18
AB  - The process of angiogenesis is under complex regulation in adult organisms,
      particularly as it often occurs in an inflammatory post-wound environment. As
      such, there are many impacting factors that will regulate the generation of new
      blood vessels which include not only pro-angiogenic growth factors such as
      vascular endothelial growth factor, but also angiostatic factors. During initial 
      postwound hemostasis, a large initial bolus of platelet factor 4 is released into
      localized areas of damage before progression of wound healing toward tissue
      homeostasis. Because of its early presence and high concentration, the
      angiostatic chemokine platelet factor 4, which can induce endothelial anoikis,
      can strongly affect angiogenesis. In our work, we explored signaling crosstalk
      interactions between vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet factor 4
      using phosphotyrosine-enriched mass spectrometry methods on human dermal
      microvascular endothelial cells cultured under conditions facilitating migratory 
      sprouting into collagen gel matrices. We developed new methods to enable mass
      spectrometry-based phosphorylation analysis of primary cells cultured on collagen
      gels, and quantified signaling pathways over the first 48 h of treatment with
      vascular endothelial growth factor in the presence or absence of platelet factor 
      4. By observing early and late signaling dynamics in tandem with correlation
      network modeling, we found that platelet factor 4 has significant crosstalk with 
      vascular endothelial growth factor by modulating cell migration and polarization 
      pathways, centered around P38α MAPK, Src family kinases Fyn and Lyn, along with
      FAK. Interestingly, we found EphA2 correlational topology to strongly involve key
      migration-related signaling nodes after introduction of platelet factor 4,
      indicating an influence of the angiostatic factor on this ambiguous but generally
      angiogenic signal in this complex environment.

TI  - ERK phosphorylation of MED14 in promoter complexes during mitogen-induced gene
      activation by Elk-1.
PG  - 10241-53
AB  - The ETS domain transcription factor Elk-1 stimulates expression of immediate
      early genes (IEGs) in response to mitogens. These events require phosphorylation 
      of Elk-1 by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and
      phosphorylation-dependent interaction of Elk-1 with co-activators, including
      histone acetyltransferases and the Mediator complex. Elk-1 also recruits ERK to
      the promoters of its target genes, suggesting that ERK phosphorylates additional 
      substrates in transcription complexes at mitogen-responsive promoters. Here we
      report that MED14, a core subunit of the Mediator, is a bona fide ERK substrate
      and identify serine 986 (S986) within a serine-proline rich region of MED14 as
      the major ERK phosphorylation site. Mitogens induced phosphorylation of MED14 on 
      S986 at IEG promoters; RNAi knockdown of MED14 reduced CDK8 and RNA polymerase II
      (RNAPII) recruitment, RNAPII C-terminal domain phosphorylation and impaired
      activation of IEG transcription. A single alanine substitution at S986 reduced
      activation of an E26 (ETS)-responsive reporter by oncogenic Ras and
      mitogen-induced, Elk-1-dependent transcription, whereas activities of other
      transcriptional activators were unaffected. We also demonstrate that Elk-1 can
      associate with MED14 independently of MED23, which may facilitate phosphorylation
      of MED14 by ERK to impart a positive and selective impact on mitogen-responsive
      gene expression.

PG  - 19426-31
AB  - Growing evidence suggests that successful intervention in many human cancers will
      require combinations of therapeutic agents. Critical to this effort will be a
      detailed understanding of the crosstalk between signaling networks that modulate 
      proliferation, cell death, drug sensitivity, and acquired resistance. Here we
      investigated DNA-damage signaling elicited by small-molecule inhibitors against
      MAP/ERK kinase (MEK) and PI3K in melanoma cells. This work, performed using
      cutting-edge mass spectrometry proteomics, uncovered a burst of signaling among
      proteins in the DNA-damage pathway upon initiation of the cell-death program by
      agents targeting the RAS–RAF–MEK and PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathways. These signals may
      prove important to the short- and long-term sensitivity of tumor cells to MEK-
      and PI3K-targeted therapies.

TI  - Where is mTOR and what is it doing there?
PG  - 563-74
AB  - Target of rapamycin (TOR) forms two conserved, structurally distinct kinase
      complexes termed TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2. Each complex phosphorylates a
      different set of substrates to regulate cell growth. In mammals, mTOR is
      stimulated by nutrients and growth factors and inhibited by stress to ensure that
      cells grow only during favorable conditions. Studies in different organisms have 
      reported localization of TOR to several distinct subcellular compartments.
      Notably, the finding that mTORC1 is localized to the lysosome has significantly
      enhanced our understanding of mTORC1 regulation. Subcellular localization may be 
      a general principle used by TOR to enact precise spatial and temporal control of 
      cell growth.

      regulating transcription and β-catenin occupancy at Wnt targets. This study thus 
      significantly elaborates on the role of α-catenin in the APC complex and at Wnt
      target genes.

TI  - SILAC-based phosphoproteomics reveals an inhibitory role of KSR1 in p53
      transcriptional activity via modulation of DBC1.
PG  - 2675-84
AB  - Background:: We have previously identified kinase suppressor of ras-1 (KSR1) as a
      potential regulatory gene in breast cancer. KSR1, originally described as a novel
      protein kinase, has a role in activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases.
      Emerging evidence has shown that KSR1 may have dual functions as an active kinase
      as well as a scaffold facilitating multiprotein complex assembly. Although
      efforts have been made to study the role of KSR1 in certain tumour types, its
      involvement in breast cancer remains unknown. Methods:: A quantitative mass
      spectrometry analysis using stable isotope labelling of amino acids in cell
      culture (SILAC) was implemented to identify KSR1-regulated phosphoproteins in
      breast cancer. In vitro luciferase assays, co-immunoprecipitation as well as
      western blotting experiments were performed to further study the function of KSR1
      in breast cancer. Results:: Of significance, proteomic analysis reveals that KSR1
      overexpression decreases deleted in breast cancer-1 (DBC1) phosphorylation.
      Furthermore, we show that KSR1 decreases the transcriptional activity of p53 by
      reducing the phosphorylation of DBC1, which leads to a reduced interaction of
      DBC1 with sirtuin-1 (SIRT1); this in turn enables SIRT1 to deacetylate p53.
      Conclusion:: Our findings integrate KSR1 into a network involving DBC1 and SIRT1,
      which results in the regulation of p53 acetylation and its transcriptional
      activity.

TI  - Functional genomics in the study of yeast cell polarity: moving in the right
      direction.
LID - 20130118
AB  - The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used extensively for the
      study of cell polarity, owing to both its experimental tractability and the high 
      conservation of cell polarity and other basic biological processes among
      eukaryotes. The budding yeast has also served as a pioneer model organism for
      virtually all genome-scale approaches, including functional genomics, which aims 
      to define gene function and biological pathways systematically through the
      analysis of high-throughput experimental data. Here, we outline the contributions
      of functional genomics and high-throughput methodologies to the study of cell
      polarity in the budding yeast. We integrate data from published genetic screens
      that use a variety of functional genomics approaches to query different aspects
      of polarity. Our integrated dataset is enriched for polarity processes, as well
      as some processes that are not intrinsically linked to cell polarity, and may
      provide new areas for future study.

TI  - ERK as a model for systems biology of enzyme kinetics in cells.
PG  - R972-9
AB  - A key step towards a chemical picture of enzyme catalysis was taken in 1913, when
      Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten published their studies of sucrose hydrolysis by
      invertase. Based on a novel experimental design and a mathematical model, their
      work offered a quantitative view of biochemical kinetics well before the protein 
      nature of enzymes was established and complexes with substrates could be
      detected. Michaelis-Menten kinetics provides a solid framework for enzyme
      kinetics in vitro, but what about kinetics in cells, where enzymes can be highly 
      regulated and participate in a multitude of interactions? We discuss this
      question using the Extracellular Signal Regulated Kinase (ERK) as a model of an
      important enzyme for which we have crystal structures, quantitative in vitro
      assays, and a vast list of binding partners. Despite great progress, we still
      cannot quantitatively predict how the rates of ERK-dependent reactions respond to
      genetic and pharmacological perturbations. Achieving this goal, which is
      important from both fundamental and practical standpoints, requires measuring the

TI  - A Specific PTPRC/CD45 Phosphorylation Event Governed by Stem Cell Chemokine
      CXCL12 Regulates Primitive Hematopoietic Cell Motility*.
PG  - 3319-29
AB  - CXCL12 governs cellular motility, a process deregulated by hematopoietic stem
      cell oncogenes such as p210-BCR-ABL. A phosphoproteomics approach to the analysis
      of a hematopoietic progenitor cell line treated with CXCL12 and the Rac 1 and 2
      inhibitor NSC23766 has been employed to objectively discover novel mechanisms for
      regulation of stem cells in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. The proteomic
      data sets identified new aspects of CXCL12-mediated signaling and novel features 
      of stem cell regulation. We also identified a novel phosphorylation event in
      hematopoietic progenitor cells that correlated with motile response and governed 
      by the chemotactic factor CXCL12. The novel phosphorylation site on PTPRC/CD45; a
      protein tyrosine phosphatase, was validated by raising an antibody to the site
      and also using a mass spectrometry absolute quantification strategy. Site
      directed mutagenesis and inhibitor studies demonstrated that this single
      phosphorylation site governs hematopoietic progenitor cell and lymphoid cell
      motility, lies downstream from Rac proteins and potentiates Src signaling. We
      have also demonstrated that PTPRC/CD45 is down-regulated in leukemogenic tyrosine
      kinase expressing cells. The use of discovery proteomics has enabled further
      understanding of the regulation of PTPRC/CD45 and its important role in cellular 
      motility in progenitor cells.

TI  - Development of a 5-plex SILAC Method Tuned for the Quantitation of Tyrosine
      Phosphorylation Dynamics.
PG  - 3339-49
AB  - The propagation of phosphorylation downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases is a
      key dynamic cellular event involved in signal transduction, which is often
      deregulated in disease states such as cancer. Probing phosphorylation dynamics is
      therefore crucial for understanding receptor tyrosine kinases' function and
      finding ways to inhibit their effects. MS methods combined with metabolic
      labeling such as stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)
      have already proven successful in deciphering temporal phosphotyrosine
      perturbations. However, they are limited in terms of multiplexing, and they also 
      are time consuming, because several experiments need to be performed separately. 
      Here, we introduce an innovative approach based on 5-plex SILAC that allows
      monitoring of phosphotyrosine signaling perturbations induced by a drug treatment
      in one single experiment. Using this new labeling strategy specifically tailored 
      for phosphotyrosines, it was possible to generate the time profiles for 318
      unique phosphopeptides belonging to 215 proteins from an erlotinib-treated breast
      cancer cell line model. Hierarchical clustering of the time profiles followed by 
      pathway enrichment analysis highlighted epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR or
      ErbB1) and ErbB2 signaling as the major pathways affected by erlotinib, thereby
      validating the method. Moreover, based on the similarity of its time profile to
      those of other proteins in the ErbB pathways, the phosphorylation at Tyr453 of
      protein FAM59A, a recently described adaptor of EGFR, was confirmed as tightly
      involved in the signaling cascade. The present investigation also demonstrates
      the remote effect of EGFR inhibition on ErbB3 phosphorylation sites such as
      Tyr1289 and Tyr1328, as well as a potential feedback effect on Tyr877 of ErbB2.
      Overall, the 5-plex SILAC is a straightforward approach that extends sample
      multiplexing and builds up the arsenal of methods for tyrosine phosphorylation
      dynamics.

TI  - H1 histones: current perspectives and challenges.
PG  - 9593-609
AB  - H1 and related linker histones are important both for maintenance of higher-order
      chromatin structure and for the regulation of gene expression. The biology of the
      linker histones is complex, as they are evolutionarily variable, exist in
      multiple isoforms and undergo a large variety of posttranslational modifications 
      in their long, unstructured, NH2- and COOH-terminal tails. We review recent
      progress in understanding the structure, genetics and posttranslational
      modifications of linker histones, with an emphasis on the dynamic interactions of
      these proteins with DNA and transcriptional regulators. We also discuss various
      experimental challenges to the study of H1 and related proteins, including
      limitations of immunological reagents and practical difficulties in the analysis 
      of posttranslational modifications by mass spectrometry.

      Tumors.
LID - 10.1016/j.jprot.2013.07.023
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
      worldwide. Within the molecular scope of NCSLC, a complex landscape of
      dysregulated cellular signaling has emerged, defined largely by mutations in
      select mediators of signal transduction, including the epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma (ALK) kinases. Consequently, these mutant
      kinases become constitutively activated and targets for chemotherapeutic
      intervention. Encouragingly, small molecule inhibitors of these pathways have
      shown promise in clinical trials or are approved for clinical use. However, many 
      protein kinases are dysregulated in NSCLC without genetic mutations. To quantify 
      differences in tumor cell signaling that are transparent to genomic methods, we
      established a super-SILAC internal standard derived from NSCLC cell lines grown
      in vitro and labeled with heavy lysine and arginine, and deployed them in a
      phosphoproteomics workflow. We identified 9019 and 8753 phosphorylation sites in 
      two separate tumors. Relative quantification of phosphopeptide abundance between 
      tumor samples allowed for the determination of specific hubs and pathways
      differing between each tumor. Sites downstream of Ras showed decreased inhibitory
      phosphorylation (Raf/Mek) and increased activating phosphorylation (Erk1/2) in
      one tumor versus another. In this way, we were able to quantitatively access
      oncogenic kinase signaling in primary human tumors.

LID - 10.1021/pr4005103
AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative process that involves
      altered brain immune, neuronal and metabolic functions. Understanding the
      underlying mechanisms has relied on mouse models that mimic components of AD
      pathology. We used gel-free, label-free LC/MS/MS to quantify protein and
      phosphopeptide levels in brains of APPSwDI/NOS2−/− (CVN-AD) mice. CVN-AD mice
      show a full spectrum of AD-like pathology, including amyloid deposition,
      hyperphosphorylated and aggregated tau and neuronal loss that worsens with age.
      Tryptic digests, with or without phosphopeptide enrichment on an automated
      titanium dioxide LC system, were separated by on-line two-dimensional LC and
      analyzed on a Waters Synapt G2 HDMS, yielding relative expression for >950
      proteins and >1100 phosphopeptides. Among differentially expressed proteins were 
      known markers found in humans with AD, including GFAP and C1Q. Phosphorylation of
      connexin 43, not previously described in AD, was increased at 42 weeks,
      consistent with dysregulation of gap junctions and activation of astrocytes.
      Additional alterations in phosphoproteins suggests dysregulation of mitochondria,
      synaptic transmission, vesicle trafficking and innate immune pathways. These data
      validate the CVN-AD mouse model of AD, identify novel disease and age-related
      changes in the brain during disease progression and demonstrate the utility of
      integrating unbiased and phosphoproteomics for understanding disease processes in
      AD.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy caused by a
      microenviromentally aided persistence of plasma cells in the bone marrow. The
      role that extracellular vesicles, microvesicles and exosomes, released by MM
      cells have in cell-to-cell communication and signaling in the bone marrow is
      currently unknown. This paper describes the proteomic content of extracellular
      vesicles derived from MM.1S and U266 MM cell lines. First, we compared the
      protein identifications between the vesicles and cellular lysates of each cell
      line finding a large overlap in protein identifications. Next, we applied
      label-free spectral count quantitation to determine proteins with differential
      abundance between the groups. Finally, we used bioinformatics to categorize
      proteins with significantly different abundances into functional groups. The
      results illustrate the first use of label-free spectral counting applied to
      determine relative protein abundances in extracellular vesicles.

PG  - 2497-508
AB  - The fungus Septoria tritici causes the disease septoria tritici blotch in wheat, 
      one of the most economically devastating foliar diseases in this crop. To
      investigate signaling events and defense responses in the wheat–S. tritici
      interaction, we performed a time-course study of S. tritici infection in
      resistant and susceptible wheat using quantitative proteomics and
      phosphoproteomics, with special emphasis on the initial biotrophic phase of
      interactions. Our study revealed an accumulation of defense and stress-related
      proteins, suppression of photosynthesis, and changes in sugar metabolism during
      compatible and incompatible interactions. However, differential regulation of the
      phosphorylation status of signaling proteins, transcription and translation
      regulators, and membrane-associated proteins was observed between two
      interactions. The proteomic data were correlated with a more rapid or stronger
      accumulation of signal molecules, including calcium, H2O2, NO, and sugars, in the
      resistant than in the susceptible cultivar in response to the infection.
      Additionally, 31 proteins and 5 phosphoproteins from the pathogen were
      identified, including metabolic proteins and signaling proteins such as
      GTP-binding proteins, 14–3-3 proteins, and calcium-binding proteins. Quantitative
      PCR analysis showed the expression of fungal signaling genes and genes encoding a
      superoxide dismutase and cell-wall degrading enzymes. These results indicate
      roles of signaling, antioxidative stress mechanisms, and nutrient acquisition in 
      facilitating the initial symptomless growth. Taken in its entirety, our dataset
      suggests interplay between the plant and S. tritici through complex signaling
      networks and downstream molecular events. Resistance is likely related to several
      rapidly and intensively triggered signal transduction cascades resulting in a
      multiple-level activation of transcription and translation processes of defense
      responses. Our sensitive approaches and model provide a comprehensive
      (phospho)proteomics resource for studying signaling from the point of view of
      both host and pathogen during a plant–pathogen interaction.

TI  - Target Inhibition Networks: Predicting Selective Combinations of Druggable
      Targets to Block Cancer Survival Pathways.
LID - e1003226
AB  - A recent trend in drug development is to identify drug combinations or
      multi-target agents that effectively modify multiple nodes of disease-associated 
      networks. Such polypharmacological effects may reduce the risk of emerging drug
      resistance by means of attacking the disease networks through synergistic and
      synthetic lethal interactions. However, due to the exponentially increasing
      number of potential drug and target combinations, systematic approaches are
      needed for prioritizing the most potent multi-target alternatives on a global
      network level. We took a functional systems pharmacology approach toward the
      identification of selective target combinations for specific cancer cells by
      combining large-scale screening data on drug treatment efficacies and drug-target
      binding affinities. Our model-based prediction approach, named TIMMA, takes
      advantage of the polypharmacological effects of drugs and infers combinatorial
      drug efficacies through system-level target inhibition networks. Case studies in 
      MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells
      demonstrated how the target inhibition modeling allows systematic exploration of 
      functional interactions between drugs and their targets to maximally inhibit
      multiple survival pathways in a given cancer type. The TIMMA prediction results
      were experimentally validated by means of systematic siRNA-mediated silencing of 
      the selected targets and their pairwise combinations, showing increased ability
      to identify not only such druggable kinase targets that are essential for cancer 
      survival either individually or in combination, but also synergistic interactions
      indicative of non-additive drug efficacies. These system-level analyses were
      enabled by a novel model construction method utilizing maximization and
      minimization rules, as well as a model selection algorithm based on sequential
      forward floating search. Compared with an existing computational solution, TIMMA 
      showed both enhanced prediction accuracies in cross validation as well as
      significant reduction in computation times. Such cost-effective
      computational-experimental design strategies have the potential to greatly
      speed-up the drug testing efforts by prioritizing those interventions and
      interactions warranting further study in individual cancer cases.

TI  - Phosphoproteomic Analyses Reveal Signaling Pathways That Facilitate Lytic
      Gammaherpesvirus Replication.
LID - e1003583
AB  - Lytic gammaherpesvirus (GHV) replication facilitates the establishment of
      lifelong latent infection, which places the infected host at risk for numerous
      cancers. As obligate intracellular parasites, GHVs must control and usurp
      cellular signaling pathways in order to successfully replicate, disseminate to
      stable latency reservoirs in the host, and prevent immune-mediated clearance. To 
      facilitate a systems-level understanding of phosphorylation-dependent signaling
      events directed by GHVs during lytic replication, we utilized label-free
      quantitative mass spectrometry to interrogate the lytic replication cycle of
      murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV68). Compared to controls, MHV68 infection
      regulated by 2-fold or greater ca. 86% of identified phosphopeptides – a
      regulatory scale not previously observed in phosphoproteomic evaluations of
      discrete signal-inducing stimuli. Network analyses demonstrated that the
      infection-associated induction or repression of specific cellular proteins
      globally altered the flow of information through the host phosphoprotein network,
      yielding major changes to functional protein clusters and ontologically
      associated proteins. A series of orthogonal bioinformatics analyses revealed that
      MAPK and CDK-related signaling events were overrepresented in the
      infection-associated phosphoproteome and identified 155 host proteins, such as
      the transcription factor c-Jun, as putative downstream targets. Importantly,
      functional tests of bioinformatics-based predictions confirmed ERK1/2 and CDK1/2 
      as kinases that facilitate MHV68 replication and also demonstrated the importance
      of c-Jun. Finally, a transposon-mutant virus screen identified the MHV68 cyclin D
      ortholog as a viral protein that contributes to the prominent MAPK/CDK signature 
      of the infection-associated phosphoproteome. Together, these analyses enhance an 
      understanding of how GHVs reorganize and usurp intracellular signaling networks
      to facilitate infection and replication.

      proteomics.
PG  - 723-34
AB  - Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become an indispensable tool for
      protein identification and quantification. In this review, common MS workflows
      are described, with an emphasis on applications of MS-based proteomics in
      developmental biology. Progress has been made in the analysis of proteome changes
      during tissue differentiation and in various genetic perturbations. MS-based
      proteomics has been particularly useful for identifying novel protein
      interactions by affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS), many of which
      have been subsequently functionally validated and led to the discovery of
      previously unknown modes of developmental regulation. Quantitative proteomics
      approaches can be used to study post-translational protein modifications (PTMs)
      such as phosphorylation, to reveal the dynamics of intracellular signal
      transduction. Integrative approaches combine quantitative MS-based proteomics
      with other high-throughput methods, with the promise of a systems level
      understanding of developmental regulation.

TI  - HER2 Stabilizes EGFR and Itself by Altering Autophosphorylation Patterns in a
      Manner That Overcomes Regulatory Mechanisms and Promotes Proliferative and
      Transformation Signaling.
PG  - 4169-80
AB  - One of the causes of breast cancer is overexpression of the human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Enhanced receptor autophosphorylation and
      resistance to activation-induced down regulation have been suggested as
      mechanisms for HER2-induced sustained signaling and cell transformation. However,
      the molecular mechanisms underlying these possibilities remain incompletely
      understood. In the current report, we present evidence that show that HER2
      overexpression does not lead to receptor hyper-autophosphorylation, but alters
      patterns in a manner that favors receptor stability and sustained signaling.
      Specifically, HER2 overexpression blocks EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation on Y1045
      and Y1068, the known docking sites of c-Cbl and Grb2, respectively, while
      promoting phosphorylation on Y1173, the known docking site of the Gab adaptor
      proteins and phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ). Under these conditions, HER2 itself is
      phosphorylated on Y1221/1222, with no known role, and on Y1248 that corresponds
      to Y1173 of EGFR. Interestingly, suppressed EGFR autophosphorylation on the Grb2 
      and c-Cbl binding sites correlated with receptor stability and sustained
      signaling, suggesting that HER2 accomplishes these tasks by altering
      autophosphorylation patterns. In conformity with these findings, mutation of the 
      Grb2 binding site on EGFR (Y1068F-EGFR) conferred resistance to ligand-induced
      degradation which in turn induced sustained signaling, and increased cell
      proliferation and transformation. These findings suggest that the Grb2 binding
      site on EGFR is redundant for signaling, but critical for receptor regulation. On
      the other hand, mutation of the putative Grb2 binding site in HER2 (Y1139) did
      not affect stability, signaling or transformation, suggesting that Y1139 in HER2 
      may not serve as a Grb2 binding site. In agreement with the role of EGFR in HER2 
      signaling, inhibition of EGFR expression reduced HER2-induced
      anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis. These results imply that
      complementing HER2-targeted therapies with anti-EGFR drugs may be beneficial in
      HER2-positive breast cancer.

TI  - Convergence in parameters and predictions using computational experimental
      design.
LID - 20130008
AB  - Typically, biological models fitted to experimental data suffer from significant 
      parameter uncertainty, which can lead to inaccurate or uncertain predictions. One
      school of thought holds that accurate estimation of the true parameters of a
      biological system is inherently problematic. Recent work, however, suggests that 
      optimal experimental design techniques can select sets of experiments whose
      members probe complementary aspects of a biochemical network that together can
      account for its full behaviour. Here, we implemented an experimental design
      approach for selecting sets of experiments that constrain parameter uncertainty. 
      We demonstrated with a model of the epidermal growth factor–nerve growth factor
      pathway that, after synthetically performing a handful of optimal experiments,
      the uncertainty in all 48 parameters converged below 10 per cent. Furthermore,
      the fitted parameters converged to their true values with a small error
      consistent with the residual uncertainty. When untested experimental conditions
      were simulated with the fitted models, the predicted species concentrations
      converged to their true values with errors that were consistent with the residual
      uncertainty. This paper suggests that accurate parameter estimation is achievable
      with complementary experiments specifically designed for the task, and that the
      resulting parametrized models are capable of accurate predictions.

      NEW AND UNEXPECTED SUBSTRATES.
PG  - 2815-34
AB  - The insulin signaling pathway regulates whole-body glucose homeostasis by
      transducing extracellular signals from the insulin receptor (IR) to downstream
      intracellular targets, thus coordinating a multitude of biological functions.
      Dysregulation of IR or its signal transduction is associated with insulin
      resistance, which may culminate in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Following initial
      stimulation of IR, insulin signaling diverges into different pathways, activating
      multiple substrates which have roles in various metabolic and cellular processes.
      The integration of multiple pathways arising from IR activation continues to
      expand as new IR substrates are identified and characterized. Accordingly, our
      review will focus on roles for IR substrates as they pertain to three primary
      areas: Metabolism/glucose uptake, Mitogenesis/growth, and Aging/Longevity. While 
      IR functions in a seemingly pleotropic manner in many cell types, through these
      three main roles in fat and skeletal muscle cells, IR multi-tasks to regulate
      whole-body glucose homeostasis to impact healthspan and lifespan.

TI  - LY2801653 is an orally bioavailable multi-kinase inhibitor with potent activity
      against MET, MST1R, and other oncoproteins, and displays anti-tumor activities in
      mouse xenograft models.
PG  - 833-44
AB  - The HGF/MET signaling pathway regulates a wide variety of normal cellular
      functions that can be subverted to support neoplasia, including cell
      proliferation, survival, apoptosis, scattering and motility, invasion, and
      angiogenesis. MET over-expression (with or without gene amplification), aberrant 
      autocrine or paracrine ligand production, and missense MET mutations are
      mechanisms that lead to activation of the MET pathway in tumors and are
      associated with poor prognostic outcome. We report here preclinical development
      of a potent, orally bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor LY2801653 targeting
      MET kinase. LY2801653 is a type-II ATP competitive, slow-off inhibitor of MET
      tyrosine kinase with a dissociation constant (Ki) of 2 nM, a pharmacodynamic
      residence time (Koff) of 0.00132 min−1 and t1/2 of 525 min. LY2801653
      demonstrated in vitro effects on MET pathway-dependent cell scattering and cell
      proliferation; in vivo anti-tumor effects in MET amplified (MKN45), MET autocrine
      (U-87MG, and KP4) and MET over-expressed (H441) xenograft models; and in vivo
      vessel normalization effects. LY2801653 also maintained potency against 13 MET
      variants, each bearing a single-point mutation. In subsequent nonclinical
      characterization, LY2801653 was found to have potent activity against several
      other receptor tyrosine oncokinases including MST1R, FLT3, AXL, MERTK, TEK, ROS1,
      DDR1/2 and against the serine/threonine kinases MKNK1/2. The potential value of
      MET and other inhibited targets within a number of malignancies (such as colon,
      bile ducts, and lung) is discussed. LY2801653 is currently in phase 1 clinical
      testing in patients with advanced cancer (trial I3O-MC-JSBA,
      NCT01285037).Electronic supplementary material: The online version of this

TI  - Signal transduction in cerebral arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage—a
      phosphoproteomic approach.
PG  - 1259-69
AB  - After subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), pathologic changes in cerebral arteries
      contribute to delayed cerebral ischemia and poor outcome. We hypothesize such
      changes are triggered by early intracellular signals, targeting of which may
      prevent SAH-induced vasculopathy. We performed an unbiased quantitative analysis 
      of early SAH-induced phosphorylations in cerebral arteries and evaluated
      identified signaling components as targets for prevention of delayed vasculopathy
      and ischemia. Labeled phosphopeptides from rat cerebral arteries were quantified 
      by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Selected SAH-induced
      phosphorylations were validated by immunoblotting and monitored over a 24-hour
      time course post SAH. Moreover, inhibition of key phosphoproteins was performed. 
      Major SAH-induced phosphorylations were observed on focal adhesion complexes,
      extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), calcium calmodulin-dependent kinase 
      II, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT3) and c-Jun, the
      latter two downstream of ERK1/2. Inhibition of ERK1/2 6-hour post SAH prevented
      increases in cerebrovascular constrictor receptors, matrix metalloprotease-9,
      wall thickness, and improved neurologic outcome. STAT3 inhibition partially
      mimicked these effects. The study shows that quantitative mass spectrometry is a 
      strong approach to study in vivo vascular signaling. Moreover, it shows that
      targeting of ERK1/2 prevents delayed pathologic changes in cerebral arteries and 
      improves outcome, and identifies SAH-induced signaling components downstream and 
      upstream of ERK1/2.

      Phosphoproteomics*.
PG  - 2070-80
AB  - Although K-Ras, Cdc42, and PAK4 signaling are commonly deregulated in cancer,
      only a few studies have sought to comprehensively examine the spectrum of
      phosphorylation-mediated signaling downstream of each of these key signaling
      nodes. In this study, we completed a label-free quantitative analysis of
      oncogenic K-Ras, activated Cdc42, and PAK4-mediated phosphorylation signaling,
      and report relative quantitation of 2152 phosphorylated peptides on 1062
      proteins. We define the overlap in phosphopeptides regulated by K-Ras, Cdc42, and
      PAK4, and find that perturbation of these signaling components affects
      phosphoproteins associated with microtubule depolymerization, cytoskeletal
      organization, and the cell cycle. These findings provide a resource for future
      studies to characterize novel targets of oncogenic K-Ras signaling and validate
      biomarkers of PAK4 inhibition.

TI  - Dissection of TBK1 signaling via phosphoproteomics in lung cancer cells.
PG  - 12414-9
AB  - TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) has emerged as a novel therapeutic target for
      unspecified subset of lung cancers. TBK1 reportedly mediates prosurvival
      signaling by activating NF-κB and AKT. However, we observed that TBK1 knockdown
      also decreased viability of cells expressing constitutively active NF-κB and
      interferon regulatory factor 3. Basal phospho-AKT level was not reduced after
      TBK1 knockdown in TBK1-sensitive lung cancer cells, implicating that TBK1
      mediates unknown survival mechanisms. To gain better insight into TBK1 survival
      signaling, we searched for altered phosphoproteins using mass spectrometry
      following RNAi-mediated TBK1 knockdown. In total, we identified 2,080
      phosphoproteins (4,621 peptides), of which 385 proteins (477 peptides) were
      affected after TBK1 knockdown. A view of the altered network identified a central
      role of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) and known PLK1 targets. We found that TBK1
      directly phosphorylated PLK1 in vitro. TBK1 phosphorylation was induced at
      mitosis, and loss of TBK1 impaired mitotic phosphorylation of PLK1 in
      TBK1-sensitive lung cancer cells. Furthermore, lung cancer cell sensitivity to
      TBK1 was highly correlated with sensitivity to pharmacological PLK inhibition. We
      additionally found that TBK1 knockdown decreased metadherin phosphorylation at
      Ser-568. Metadherin was associated with poor outcome in lung cancer, and loss of 
      metadherin caused growth inhibition and apoptosis in TBK1-sensitive lung cancer
      cells. These results collectively revealed TBK1 as a mitosis regulator through
      activation of PLK1 and also suggested metadherin as a putative TBK1 downstream
      effector involved in lung cancer cell survival.

TI  - Alterations of Histone H1 Phosphorylation During Bladder Carcinogenesis.
PG  - 3317-26
AB  - There is a crucial need for development of prognostic and predictive biomarkers
      in human bladder carcinogenesis in order to personalize preventive and
      therapeutic strategies and improve outcomes. Epigenetic alterations, such as
      histone modifications, are implicated in the genetic dysregulation that is
      fundamental to carcinogenesis. Here we focus on profiling the histone
      modifications during the progression of bladder cancer. Histones were extracted
      from normal human bladder epithelial cells, an immortalized human bladder
      epithelial cell line (hTERT), and four human bladder cancer cell lines (RT4, J82,
      T24, and UMUC3) ranging from superficial low-grade to invasive high-grade
      cancers. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) profiling revealed a
      statistically significant increase in phosphorylation of H1 linker histones from 
      normal human bladder epithelial cells to low-grade superficial to high-grade
      invasive bladder cancer cells. This finding was further validated by
      immunohistochemical staining of the normal epithelium and transitional cell
      cancer from human bladders. Cell cycle analysis of histone H1 phosphorylation by 
      western blotting showed an increase of phosphorylation from G0/G1 phase to M
      phase, again supporting this as a proliferative marker. Changes in histone H1
      phosphorylation status may further clarify epigenetic changes during bladder
      carcinogenesis and provide diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers or targets for
      future therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Nutrient Regulation of the mTOR Complex 1 Signaling Pathway.
PG  - 463-73
AB  - The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an evolutionally conserved kinase
      which exists in two distinct structural and functional complexes, mTOR complex 1 
      (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Of the two complexes, mTORC1 couples
      nutrient abundance to cell growth and proliferation by sensing and integrating a 
      variety of inputs arising from amino acids, cellular stresses, energy status, and
      growth factors. Defects in mTORC1 regulation are implicated in the development of
      many metabolic diseases, including cancer and diabetes. Over the past decade,
      significant advances have been made in deciphering the complexity of the
      signaling processes contributing to mTORC1 regulation and function, but the
      mechanistic details are still not fully understood. In particular, how amino acid
      availability is sensed by cells and signals to mTORC1 remains unclear. In this
      review, we discuss the current understanding of nutrient-dependent control of
      mTORC1 signaling and will focus on the key components involved in amino acid
      signaling to mTORC1.

TI  - Dynamic Adipocyte Phosphoproteome Reveals that Akt Directly Regulates mTORC2.
PG  - 1009-20
AB  - A major challenge of the post-genomics era is to define the connectivity of
      protein phosphorylation networks. Here, we quantitatively delineate the insulin
      signaling network in adipocytes by high-resolution mass spectrometry-based
      proteomics. These data reveal the complexity of intracellular protein
      phosphorylation. We identified 37,248 phosphorylation sites on 5,705 proteins in 
      this single-cell type, with approximately 15% responding to insulin. We
      integrated these large-scale phosphoproteomics data using a machine learning
      approach to predict physiological substrates of several diverse insulin-regulated
      kinases. This led to the identification of an Akt substrate, SIN1, a core
      component of the mTORC2 complex. The phosphorylation of SIN1 by Akt was found to 
      regulate mTORC2 activity in response to growth factors, revealing topological
      insights into the Akt/mTOR signaling network. The dynamic phosphoproteome
      described here contains numerous phosphorylation sites on proteins involved in
      diverse molecular functions and should serve as a useful functional resource for 
      cell biologists.

AB  - Quantitative proteomics is an important tool to study biological processes, but
      so far it has been challenging to apply to zebrafish. Here, we describe a large
      scale quantitative analysis of the zebrafish proteome using a combination of
      stable isotope labeling and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
      Proteins derived from the fully labeled fish were used as a standard to quantify 
      changes during embryonic heart development. LC-MS-assisted analysis of the
      proteome of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule zebrafish morphants
      revealed a down-regulation of components of the network required for cell
      adhesion and maintenance of cell shape as well as secondary changes due to arrest
      of cellular differentiation. Quantitative proteomics in zebrafish using the
      stable isotope-labeling technique provides an unprecedented resource to study
      developmental processes in zebrafish.

PG  - 555-64
AB  - Flux through metabolic pathways is inherently sensitive to the levels of specific
      substrates and products, but cellular metabolismis also managed by integrated
      control mechanisms that sense the nutrient and energy status of a cell or
      organism. The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1), a
      protein kinase complex ubiquitous to eukaryotic cells, has emerged as a critical 
      signaling node that links nutrient sensing to the coordinated regulation of
      cellular metabolism. Here, the role of mTORC1 as a conduit between cellular
      growth conditions and the anabolic processes that promote cell growth is
      discussed. The emerging network of signaling pathways by which mTORC1 integrates 
      systemic signals, in the form of secreted growth factors, with local signals, in 
      the form of cellular nutrients (amino acids, glucose, and oxygen) and energy
      (ATP) is detailed. Our expanding understanding of the exquisite regulatory
      network upstream of mTORC1 provides molecular insights into the integrated
      sensing mechanisms by which diverse cellular signals converge to control cell
      physiology.

TI  - The transcriptional landscape of αβ T cell differentiation.
LID - 10.1038/ni.2590
AB  - αβT cell differentiation from thymic precursors is a complex process, explored
      here with the breadth of ImmGen expression datasets, analyzing how
      differentiation of thymic precursors gives rise to transcriptomes. After
      surprisingly gradual changes though early T commitment, transit through the
      CD4+CD8+ stage involves a shutdown or rare breadth, and correlating tightly with 
      MYC. MHC-driven selection promotes a large-scale transcriptional reactivation. We
      identify distinct signatures that mark cells destined for positive selection
      versus apoptotic deletion. Differential expression of surprisingly few genes
      accompany CD4 or CD8 commitment, a similarity that carries through to peripheral 
      T cells and their activation, revealed by mass cytometry phosphoproteomics. The
      novel transcripts identified as candidate mediators of key transitions help
      define the “known unknown” of thymocyte differentiation.

TI  - Structure and dynamics of molecular networks: A novel paradigm of drug discovery:
      A comprehensive review.
PG  - 333-408
AB  - Despite considerable progress in genome- and proteome-based high-throughput
      screening methods and in rational drug design, the increase in approved drugs in 
      the past decade did not match the increase of drug development costs. Network
      description and analysis not only gives a systems-level understanding of drug
      action and disease complexity, but can also help to improve the efficiency of
      drug design. We give a comprehensive assessment of the analytical tools of
      network topology and dynamics. The state-of-the-art use of chemical similarity,
      protein structure, protein-protein interaction, signaling, genetic interaction
      and metabolic networks in the discovery of drug targets is summarized. We propose
      that network targeting follows two basic strategies. The “central hit strategy”
      selectively targets central node/edges of the flexible networks of infectious
      agents or cancer cells to kill them. The “network influence strategy” works
      against other diseases, where an efficient reconfiguration of rigid networks
      needs to be achieved. It is shown how network techniques can help in the
      identification of single-target, edgetic, multi-target and allo-network drug
      target candidates. We review the recent boom in network methods helping hit
      identification, lead selection optimizing drug efficacy, as well as minimizing
      side-effects and drug toxicity. Successful network-based drug development
      strategies are shown through the examples of infections, cancer, metabolic
      diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Summarizing >1200 references we
      suggest an optimized protocol of network-aided drug development, and provide a
      list of systems-level hallmarks of drug quality. Finally, we highlight
      network-related drug development trends helping to achieve these hallmarks by a
      cohesive, global approach.

TI  - Towards Systematic Discovery of Signaling Networks in Budding Yeast Filamentous
      Growth Stress Response Using Interventional Phosphorylation Data.
LID - e1003077
AB  - Reversible phosphorylation is one of the major mechanisms of signal transduction,
      and signaling networks are critical regulators of cell growth and development.
      However, few of these networks have been delineated completely. Towards this end,
      quantitative phosphoproteomics is emerging as a useful tool enabling large-scale 
      determination of relative phosphorylation levels. However, phosphoproteomics
      differs from classical proteomics by a more extensive sampling limitation due to 
      the limited number of detectable sites per protein. Here, we propose a
      comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline customized for phosphoproteome data 
      from interventional experiments for identifying key proteins in specific
      pathways, discovering the protein-protein interactions and inferring the
      signaling network. We also made an effort to partially compensate for the missing
      value problem, a chronic issue for proteomics studies. The dataset used for this 
      study was generated using SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell
      culture) technique with interventional experiments (kinase-dead mutations). The
      major components of the pipeline include phosphopeptide meta-analysis,
      correlation network analysis and causal relationship discovery. We have
      successfully applied our pipeline to interventional experiments identifying
      phosphorylation events underlying the transition to a filamentous growth form in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified 5 high-confidence proteins from
      meta-analysis, and 19 hub proteins from correlation analysis (Pbi2p and Hsp42p
      were identified by both analyses). All these proteins are involved in stress
      responses. Nine of them have direct or indirect evidence of involvement in
      filamentous growth. In addition, we tested four of our predicted proteins, Nth1p,
      Pbi2p, Pdr12p and Rcn2p, by interventional phenotypic experiments and all of them
      present differential invasive growth, providing prospective validation of our
      approach. This comprehensive pipeline presents a systematic way for discovering
      signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest
      candidate proteins for further investigation. We anticipate the methodology to be
      applicable as well to other interventional studies via different experimental
      platforms.

TI  - Hyperphosphorylation of polycystin-2 at a critical residue in disease reveals an 
      essential role for polycystin-1-regulated dephosphorylation.
PG  - 1924-39
AB  - Mutations in PKD1 (85%) or PKD2 (15%) account for almost all cases of autosomal
      dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The ADPKD proteins, termed as
      polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), interact via their C-termini to form a
      receptor–ion channel complex whose function and regulation are not fully
      understood. Here, we report the first phosphorylated residue (Ser829) in PC2,
      whose dephosphorylation is mediated by PC1 binding through the recruitment of
      protein phosphatase-1 alpha (PP1α). Using a new phosphospecific antibody (pPC2)
      to this site, we demonstrate that Ser829 is phosphorylated by Protein kinase A
      (PKA) but remains constitutively phosphorylated in cells and tissues lacking PC1.
      cAMP increased pSer829 basolateral localization in MDCK cells in a time dependent
      manner and was essential for pronephric development in Xenopus embryos. When
      constitutively expressed, a complex phenotype associated with enhanced
      ATP-dependent ER Ca2+ release and loss of growth suppression was observed in
      cycling cells. These results reveal a reciprocal functional link between PC1 and 
      PC2 which is critically dependent on their interaction. Unopposed cAMP stimulated
      hyperphosphorylation of PC2 in the absence of functional PC1 could contribute to 
      cyst initiation in PKD1 patients and represents a new molecular paradigm in
      understanding ADPKD pathogenesis.

TI  - The heparanase/syndecan-1 axis in cancer: mechanisms and therapies.
PG  - 2294-306
AB  - Heparanase is an endoglucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate chains of
      proteoglycans. In many malignancies, high heparanase expression and activity
      correlate with an aggressive tumor phenotype. A major consequence of heparanase
      action in cancer is a robust up-regulation of growth factor expression and
      increased shedding of syndecan-1, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan.
      Substantial evidence indicates that heparanase and syndecan-1 work together to
      drive growth factor signaling and regulate cell behaviors that enhance tumor
      growth, dissemination, angiogenesis and osteolysis. Pre-clinical and clinical
      studies have demonstrated that therapies targeting the heparanase/syndecan-1 axis
      hold promise in blocking the aggressive behavior of cancer.

TI  - Translating mRNAs strongly correlate to proteins in a multivariate manner and
      their translation ratios are phenotype specific.
PG  - 4743-54
AB  - As a well-known phenomenon, total mRNAs poorly correlate to proteins in their
      abundances as reported. Recent findings calculated with bivariate models
      suggested even poorer such correlation, whereas focusing on the translating mRNAs
      (ribosome nascent-chain complex-bound mRNAs, RNC-mRNAs) subset. In this study, we
      analysed the relative abundances of mRNAs, RNC-mRNAs and proteins on genome-wide 
      scale, comparing human lung cancer A549 and H1299 cells with normal human
      bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, respectively. As discovered, a strong
      correlation between RNC-mRNAs and proteins in their relative abundances could be 
      established through a multivariate linear model by integrating the mRNA length as
      a key factor. The R2 reached 0.94 and 0.97 in A549 versus HBE and H1299 versus
      HBE comparisons, respectively. This correlation highlighted that the mRNA length 
      significantly contributes to the translational modulation, especially to the
      translational initiation, favoured by its correlation with the mRNA translation
      ratio (TR) as observed. We found TR is highly phenotype specific, which was
      substantiated by both pathway analysis and biased TRs of the splice variants of
      BDP1 gene, which is a key transcription factor of transfer RNAs. These findings
      revealed, for the first time, the intrinsic and genome-wide translation
      modulations at translatomic level in human cells at steady-state, which are
      tightly correlated to the protein abundance and functionally relevant to cellular
      phenotypes.

PG  - 900-15
AB  - While working to understand how senescence is maintained in the presence of
      oncogenic Ras, Deschênes-Simard et al. find that attenuating ERK signaling
      prevents Ras-induced senescence. With ERK signaling inhibited, oncogenic Ras is
      then able to transform cells. ERK signaling promotes the proteasome-dependent
      degradation of proteins required for critical processes, such as cell cycle
      progression. In prostate neoplasms, high levels of phosphorylated ERK correlated 
      with a lower Gleason score and delayed disease relapse after treatment.

TI  - Role of LRF/Pokemon in lineage fate decisions.
PG  - 2845-53
AB  - In the human genome, 43 different genes are found that encode proteins belonging 
      to the family of the POK (poxvirus and zinc finger and Krüppel)/ZBTB (zinc finger
      and broad complex, tramtrack, and bric à brac) factors. Generally considered
      transcriptional repressors, several of these genes play fundamental roles in cell
      lineage fate decision in various tissues, programming specific tasks throughout
      the life of the organism. Here, we focus on functions of
      leukemia/lymphoma-related factor/POK erythroid myeloid ontogenic factor, which is
      probably one of the most exciting and yet enigmatic members of the POK/ZBTB
      family.

TI  - Structure of ERK2 bound to PEA-15 reveals a mechanism for rapid release of
      activated MAPK.
PG  - 1681
AB  - ERK1/2 kinases are the principal effectors of a central signaling cascade that
      converts extracellular stimuli into cell proliferation and migration responses
      and, when deregulated, can promote cell oncogenic transformation. The scaffolding
      protein PEA-15 is a death effector domain (DED) protein that directly interacts
      with ERK1/2 and affects ERK1/2 subcellular localization and phosphorylation.
      Here, to understand this ERK1/2 signaling complex, we have solved the crystal
      structures of PEA-15 bound to three different ERK2 phospho-conformers. The
      structures reveal that PEA-15 uses a bipartite binding mode, occupying two key
      docking sites of ERK2. Remarkably, PEA-15 can efficiently bind the ERK2
      activation loop in the critical Thr-X-Tyr region in different phosphorylation
      states. PEA-15 binding triggers an extended allosteric conduit in dually
      phosphorylated ERK2, disrupting key features of active ERK2. At the same time
      PEA-15 binding protects ERK2 from dephosphorylation, thus setting the stage for
      immediate ERK activity upon its release from the PEA-15 inhibitory complex.

TI  - The Nucleus- and Endoplasmic Reticulum-Targeted Forms of Protein Tyrosine
      Phosphatase 61F Regulate Drosophila Growth, Life Span, and Fecundity.
PG  - 1345-56
AB  - The protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) T cell PTP (TCPTP) and PTP1B share a
      high level of catalytic domain sequence and structural similarity yet display
      distinct differences in substrate recognition and function. Their noncatalytic
      domains contribute to substrate selectivity and function by regulating TCPTP
      nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and targeting PTP1B to the endoplasmic reticulum
      (ER). The Drosophila TCPTP/PTP1B orthologue PTP61F has two variants with
      identical catalytic domains that are differentially targeted to the ER and
      nucleus. Here we demonstrate that the PTP61F variants differ in their ability to 
      negatively regulate insulin signaling in vivo, with the nucleus-localized form
      (PTP61Fn) being more effective than the ER-localized form (PTP61Fm). We report
      that PTP61Fm is reliant on the adaptor protein Dock to attenuate insulin
      signaling in vivo. Also, we show that the PTP61F variants differ in their
      capacities to regulate growth, with PTP61Fn but not PTP61Fm attenuating cellular 
      proliferation. Furthermore, we generate a mutant lacking both PTP61F variants,
      which displays a reduction in median life span and a decrease in female
      fecundity, and show that both variants are required to rescue these mutant
      phenotypes. Our findings define the role of PTP61F in life span and fecundity and
      reinforce the importance of subcellular localization in mediating PTP function in
      vivo.

TI  - Systems biology approaches to identify developmental bases for lung diseases.
PG  - 514-22
AB  - A greater understanding of the regulatory processes contributing to lung
      development could be helpful to identify strategies to ameliorate morbidity and
      mortality in premature infants and to identify individuals at risk for congenital
      and/or chronic lung diseases. Over the past decade, genomics technologies have
      enabled the production of rich gene expression databases providing information
      for all genes across developmental time or in diseased tissue. These data sets
      facilitate systems biology approaches for identifying underlying biological
      modules and programs contributing to the complex processes of normal development,
      and those that may be associated with disease states. The next decade will
      undoubtedly see rapid and significant advances in redefining both lung
      development and disease at the systems level.

TI  - Dynamic Regulation of the Translation Initiation Helicase Complex by Mitogenic
      Signal Transduction to Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4G.
PG  - 937-46
AB  - Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F), comprising the cap-binding
      protein eIF4E, the helicase eIF4A, and the central scaffold eIF4G, is a
      convergence node for a complex signaling network that controls protein synthesis.
      Together with eIF3 and eIF4A/4B, eIF4G recruits ribosomal subunits to mRNAs and
      facilitates 5′ untranslated region unwinding. Mammalian eIF4G contains three HEAT
      domains and unstructured regions involved in protein-protein interactions.
      Despite detailed eIF4G structure data, the mechanisms controlling initiation
      scaffold formation remain obscure. We found a new, highly regulated eIF4B/-3
      binding site within the HEAT-1/-2 interdomain linker, harboring two
      phosphorylation sites that we identified as substrates for Erk1/2 and casein
      kinase 2. Phorbol ester-induced sequential phosphorylation of both sites detached
      HEAT-2 from the complex with eIF4A/-4B/-3 and stimulated the association of
      HEAT-3 with the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal integrating kinase Mnk1. 
      Our results provide a mechanistic link between intracellular signal transduction 
      and dynamic initiation complex formation coordinated by flexible eIF4G structure.

TI  - A High-throughput Assay for Phosphoprotein-specific Phosphatase Activity in
      Cellular Extracts*.
PG  - 797-806
AB  - Protein phosphatases undo the post-translational modifications of
      kinase-signaling networks, but phosphatase activation in cells is difficult to
      measure and interpret. Here, we report the design of a quantitative and
      high-throughput assay platform for monitoring cellular phosphatase activity
      toward specific phosphoprotein targets. Protein substrates of interest are
      purified recombinantly, phosphorylated in vitro using the upstream kinase, and
      adsorbed to 96-well plates. Total phosphatase extracts from cells are then added 
      to trigger a solid-phase dephosphorylation reaction. After stopping the reaction,
      phosphoprotein levels are quantified by ELISA with a phospho-specific antibody,
      and the loss of phospho-specific immunoreactivity is used as the readout of
      phosphatase activity. We illustrate the generality of the method by developing
      specific phosphatase-activity assays for the three canonical mitogen-activated
      protein phospho-kinases: ERK, JNK, and p38. The assays capture changes in
      activity with a dynamic range of 25–100-fold and are sensitive to a limit of
      detection below 25,000 cells. When applied to cytokine-induced signaling, the
      assays revealed complex and dynamic regulation of phosphatases suggesting
      cross-communication and a means for cellular memory. Our assay platform should be
      beneficial for phosphoproteomic surveys and computational-systems models of
      signaling, where phosphatases are known to be important but their activities are 
      rarely measured.

TI  - Two Distinct Populations of Exosomes Are Released from LIM1863 Colon Carcinoma
      Cell-derived Organoids*.
PG  - 587-98
AB  - Exosomes are naturally occurring biological nanomembranous vesicles (∼40 to 100
      nm) of endocytic origin that are released from diverse cell types into the
      extracellular space. They have pleiotropic functions such as antigen presentation
      and intercellular transfer of protein cargo, mRNA, microRNA, lipids, and
      oncogenic potential. Here we describe the isolation, via sequential immunocapture
      using anti-A33- and anti-EpCAM-coupled magnetic beads, of two distinct
      populations of exosomes released from organoids derived from human colon
      carcinoma cell line LIM1863. The exosome populations (A33-Exos and EpCAM-Exos)
      could not be distinguished via electron microscopy and contained stereotypical
      exosome markers such as TSG101, Alix, and HSP70. The salient finding of this
      study, revealed via gel-based LC-MS/MS, was the exclusive identification in
      EpCAM-Exos of the classical apical trafficking molecules CD63 (LAMP3), mucin 13
      and the apical intestinal enzyme sucrase isomaltase and increased expression of
      dipeptidyl peptidase IV and the apically restricted pentaspan membrane
      glycoprotein prominin 1. In contrast, the A33-Exos preparation was enriched with 
      basolateral trafficking molecules such as early endosome antigen 1, the Golgi
      membrane protein ADP-ribosylation factor, and clathrin. Our observations are
      consistent with EpCAM- and A33-Exos being released from the apical and
      basolateral surfaces, respectively, and the EpCAM-Exos proteome profile with
      widely published stereotypical exosomes. A proteome analysis of LIM1863-derived
      shed microvesicles (sMVs) was also performed in order to clearly distinguish A33-
      and EpCAM-Exos from sMVs. Intriguingly, several members of the MHC class I family
      of antigen presentation molecules were exclusively observed in A33-Exos, whereas 
      neither MHC class I nor MHC class II molecules were observed via MS in
      EpCAM-Exos. Additionally, we report for the first time in any extracellular
      vesicle study the colocalization of EpCAM, claudin-7, and CD44 in EpCAM-Exos.
      Given that these molecules are known to complex together to promote tumor
      progression, further characterization of exosome subpopulations will enable a
      deeper understanding of their possible role in regulation of the tumor
      microenvironment.

TI  - The dynamic nature of the kinome.
LID - 10.1042/BJ20121456
AB  - Recent advances in proteomics have facilitated the analysis of the kinome ‘en
      masse’. What these studies have revealed is a surprisingly dynamic network of
      kinase responses to highly selective kinase inhibitors, thereby illustrating the 
      complex biological responses to these small molecules. Moreover these studies
      have identified key transcription factors, such as c-Myc and FOXO (forkhead box
      O), that play pivotal roles in kinome reprogramming in cancer cells. Since many
      kinase inhibitors fail despite a high efficacy of blocking their intended
      targets, elucidating kinome changes at a more global level will be essential to
      understanding the mechanisms of kinase inhibitor pharmacology. The development of
      technologies to study the kinome, as well as examples of kinome resilience and
      reprogramming, will be discussed in the present review.

TI  - p38α senses environmental stress to control innate immune responses via mTOR.
PG  - 1519-27
AB  - The mitogen-activated protein kinase p38α senses environmental stressors and
      orchestrates inflammatory and immunomodulatory reactions. However, the molecular 
      mechanism how p38α controls immunomodulatory responses in myeloid cells remains
      elusive. We found that in monocytes and macrophages, p38α activated the
      mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in vitro and in vivo. p38α
      signaling in myeloid immune cells promoted interleukin (IL)-10 but inhibited
      IL-12 expression via mTOR and blocked the differentiation of proinflammatory CD4+
      T helper 1 cells. Cellular stress induced p38α-mediated mTOR activation that was 
      independent of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) but dependent on the kinase MK2
      and on the inhibition of TSC1/TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis gene 1 and 2), a negative 
      regulatory complex of mTOR signaling. Remarkably, p38α and PI3K concurrently
      modulated mTOR to balance IL-12 and IL-10 expression. Our data links p38α to mTOR
      signaling in myeloid immune cells that is decisive for tuning the immune response
      in dependence on the environmental milieu.

TI  - Amphetamine increases phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK at synaptic sites in the rat
      striatum and medial prefrontal cortex.
PG  - 101-8
AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) play a central role in cell signaling. 
      Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a prototypic subclass of MAPKs and
      is densely expressed in postmitotic neurons of adult mammalian brains. Active ERK
      translocates into the nucleus to regulate gene expression. Additionally, ERK is
      visualized in neuronal peripheries, such as distal synaptic structures. While
      nuclear ERK is a known sensitive target of psychostimulants, little is known
      about the responsiveness of synaptic ERK to stimulants. In this study, we focused
      on ERK at synaptic versus extrasynaptic sites and investigated its responses to
      the psychostimulant amphetamine in the adult rat striatum and medial prefrontal
      cortex (mPFC) in vivo. We used a pre-validated biochemical fractionation
      procedure to isolate synapse- and extrasynapse-enriched membranes. We found that 
      two common ERK isoforms (ERK1 and ERK2) were concentrated more in extrasynaptic
      fractions than in synaptic fractions in striatal and cortical neurons under
      normal conditions. At synaptic sites, ERK2 was noticeably more abundant than
      ERK1. Acute injection of amphetamine induced an increase in ERK2 phosphorylation 
      in the synaptic fraction of striatal neurons, while the drug did not alter
      extrasynaptic ERK2 phosphorylation. Similar results were observed in the mPFC. In
      both synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments, total ERK1/2 proteins remained
      stable in response to amphetamine. Our data establish the subsynaptic
      distribution pattern of MAPK/ERK in striatal and cortical neurons. Moreover, the 
      synaptic pool of ERK2 in these neurons can be selectively activated by
      amphetamine.

PG  - 661-87
AB  - Temporally and spatially controlled activation of the Aurora-A kinase (AURKA) is 
      regulates centrosome maturation, entry into mitosis, formation and function of
      the bipolar spindle, and cytokinesis. Genetic amplification, and mRNA and protein
      overexpression of Aurora-A are common in many types of solid tumor, and
      associated with aneuploidy, supernumerary centrosomes, defective mitotic
      spindles, and resistance to apoptosis. These properties have led Aurora-A to be
      considered a high value target for development of cancer therapeutics, with
      multiple agents currently in early phase clinical trials. More recently,
      identification of additional, non-mitotic functions and means of activation of
      Aurora-A during interphase neurite elongation and ciliary resorption have
      significantly expanded understanding of its function, and may offer insights into
      clinical performance of Aurora-A inhibitors. We here review mitotic and
      non-mitotic functions of Aurora-A, discuss Aurora-A regulation in the context of 
      protein structural information, and evaluate progress in understanding and
      inhibiting Aurora-A in cancer.

TI  - Secretory Protein Biogenesis and Traffic in the Early Secretory Pathway.
PG  - 383-410
AB  - The secretory pathway is responsible for the synthesis, folding, and delivery of 
      a diverse array of cellular proteins. Secretory protein synthesis begins in the
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is charged with the tasks of correctly
      integrating nascent proteins and ensuring correct post-translational modification
      and folding. Once ready for forward traffic, proteins are captured into
      ER-derived transport vesicles that form through the action of the COPII coat.
      COPII-coated vesicles are delivered to the early Golgi via distinct tethering and
      fusion machineries. Escaped ER residents and other cycling transport machinery
      components are returned to the ER via COPI-coated vesicles, which undergo similar
      tethering and fusion reactions. Ultimately, organelle structure, function, and
      cell homeostasis are maintained by modulating protein and lipid flux through the 
      early secretory pathway. In the last decade, structural and mechanistic studies
      have added greatly to the strong foundation of yeast genetics on which this field
      was built. Here we discuss the key players that mediate secretory protein
      biogenesis and trafficking, highlighting recent advances that have deepened our
      understanding of the complexity of this conserved and essential process.

PG  - 1135-43
AB  - Purpose.The human lens fiber cell insoluble membrane fraction contains important 
      membrane proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and cytosolic proteins that are
      strongly associated with the membrane. The purpose of this study was to
      characterize the lens fiber cell membrane proteome and phosphoproteome from human
      lenses. Methods.HPLC-mass spectrometry–based multidimensional protein
      identification technology (MudPIT), without or with phosphopeptide enrichment,
      was applied to study the proteome and phosphoproteome of lens fiber cell
      membranes, respectively. Results.In total, 951 proteins were identified,
      including 379 integral membrane and membrane-associated proteins. Enriched gene
      categories and pathways based on the proteomic analysis include carbohydrate
      metabolism (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, pyruvate
      metabolism), proteasome, cell-cell signaling and communication (GTP binding, gap 
      junction, focal adhesion), glutathione metabolism, and actin regulation. The
      combination of TiO2 phosphopeptide enrichment and MudPIT analysis revealed 855
      phosphorylation sites on 271 proteins, including 455 phosphorylation sites that
      have not been previously identified. PKA, PKC, CKII, p38MAPK, and RSK are
      predicted as the major kinases for phosphorylation on the sites identified in the
      human lens membrane fraction. Conclusions.The results presented herein
      significantly expand the characterized proteome and phosphoproteome of the human 
      lens fiber cell and provide a valuable reference for future research in studies
      of lens development and disease.

TI  - High-Risk Human Papillomavirus E6 Oncoproteins Interact with 14-3-3ζ in a PDZ
      Binding Motif-Dependent Manner.
PG  - 1586-95
AB  - Cervical cancer develops through the combined activities of the human
      papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncoproteins. A defining characteristic of E6
      oncoproteins derived from cancer-causing HPV types is the presence of a PDZ
      binding motif (PBM) at the extreme carboxy terminus of the protein which is
      absent from E6 proteins derived from the so-called low-risk HPV types. Within
      this PBM is also a protein kinase A (PKA) phospho-acceptor site, which is thought
      to negatively regulate the association of E6 with its PDZ domain-containing
      substrates. We can now show that phosphorylation of E6 by PKA and/or AKT confers 
      the ability to interact with 14-3-3ζ. The interaction is direct and specific for 
      the high-risk HPV E6 oncoproteins, although there are significant differences in 
      the efficiencies with which HPV-16, HPV-18, and HPV-31 E6 oncoproteins can
      associate with 14-3-3ζ; this correlates directly with their respective
      susceptibilities to phosphorylation by PKA and/or AKT. We demonstrate here that
      the interaction between E6 and 14-3-3ζ also requires integrity of the E6 PBM, and
      downregulation of 14-3-3ζ results in a marked reduction in the levels of HPV-18
      E6 expression in HeLa cells. Using phospho-specific anti-E6 antibodies, we also
      demonstrate significant levels of E6 phosphorylation in vivo. These studies
      redefine the potential relevance of the E6 PBM in the development of cervical
      cancer, suggesting that interaction with 14-3-3ζ, as well as the more
      well-established interactions with PDZ domain-containing substrates, is likely to
      be responsible for the biological activities attributed to this region of the
      high-risk HPV E6 oncoproteins.

TI  - Identification of Novel in vivo MAP Kinase Substrates in Arabidopsis thaliana
      Through Use of Tandem Metal Oxide Affinity Chromatography*.
PG  - 369-80
AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MPK) cascades are important for eukaryotic
      signal transduction. They convert extracellular stimuli (e.g. some hormones,
      growth factors, cytokines, microbe- or damage-associated molecular patterns) into
      intracellular responses while at the same time amplifying the transmitting
      signal. By doing so, they ensure proper performance, and eventually survival, of 
      a given organism, for example in times of stress. MPK cascades function via
      reversible phosphorylation of cascade components MEKKs, MEKs, and MPKs. In plants
      the identity of most MPK substrates remained elusive until now. Here, we provide 
      a robust and powerful approach to identify and quantify, with high selectivity,
      site-specific phosphorylation of MPK substrate candidates in the model plant
      Arabidopsis thaliana. Our approach represents a two-step chromatography combining
      phosphoprotein enrichment using Al(OH)3-based metal oxide affinity
      chromatography, tryptic digest of enriched phosphoproteins, and TiO2-based metal 
      oxide affinity chromatography to enrich phosphopeptides from complex protein
      samples. When applied to transgenic conditional gain-of-function Arabidopsis
      plants supporting in planta activation of MPKs, the approach allows direct
      measurement and quantification ex vivo of site-specific phosphorylation of
      several reported and many yet unknown putative MPK substrates in just a single
      experiment.

TI  - Linking Proteomic and Transcriptional Data through the Interactome and Epigenome 
      Reveals a Map of Oncogene-induced Signaling.
LID - e1002887
AB  - Cellular signal transduction generally involves cascades of post-translational
      protein modifications that rapidly catalyze changes in protein-DNA interactions
      and gene expression. High-throughput measurements are improving our ability to
      study each of these stages individually, but do not capture the connections
      between them. Here we present an approach for building a network of physical
      links among these data that can be used to prioritize targets for pharmacological
      intervention. Our method recovers the critical missing links between proteomic
      and transcriptional data by relating changes in chromatin accessibility to
      changes in expression and then uses these links to connect proteomic and
      transcriptome data. We applied our approach to integrate epigenomic,
      phosphoproteomic and transcriptome changes induced by the variant III mutation of
      the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII) in a cell line model of
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). To test the relevance of the network, we used
      small molecules to target highly connected nodes implicated by the network model 
      that were not detected by the experimental data in isolation and we found that a 
      large fraction of these agents alter cell viability. Among these are two
      compounds, ICG-001, targeting CREB binding protein (CREBBP), and PKF118–310,
      targeting β-catenin (CTNNB1), which have not been tested previously for
      effectiveness against GBM. At the level of transcriptional regulation, we used
      chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to experimentally determine
      the genome-wide binding locations of p300, a transcriptional co-regulator highly 
      connected in the network. Analysis of p300 target genes suggested its role in
      tumorigenesis. We propose that this general method, in which experimental
      measurements are used as constraints for building regulatory networks from the
      interactome while taking into account noise and missing data, should be
      applicable to a wide range of high-throughput datasets.

TI  - Vasopressin inhibits apoptosis in renal collecting duct cells.
PG  - F177-88
AB  - The peptide hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a critical role in
      regulating salt and water transport in the mammalian kidney. Recent studies have 
      also demonstrated that AVP can promote cell survival in neuronal cells through V1
      receptors. The current study addresses whether AVP can inhibit apoptosis in
      kidney collecting duct cells via V2 receptors and also explores the downstream
      signaling pathways regulating this phenomenon. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
      transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling analysis and caspase cleavage 
      assays demonstrated that 1-desamino-8-d-arginine vasopressin (dDAVP) inhibited
      apoptosis induced by various agents (staurosporine, actinomycin D, and
      cycloheximide) in cultured mouse cortical collecting duct cells (mpkCCD).
      Incubation with dDAVP also inhibited apoptosis induced by the
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitor LY294002, suggesting that 
      the antiapoptotic effects of dDAVP are largely independent of PI3K signaling. The
      V2 receptor antagonist SR121463 completely abolished the antiapoptotic effects of
      dDAVP. In addition, incubation with 8-cpt-cAMP, a cell-permeable analog of cAMP, 
      reproduced the antiapoptotic effects of dDAVP. Both dDAVP and 8-cpt-cAMP
      increased phosphorylation of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bad and Bok. Bad
      phosphorylation at Ser-112 and Ser-155 is known to inhibit its proapoptotic
      activity. Preincubation with H89 blocked dDAVP-induced phosphorylation of both
      Bad and Bok, suggesting dependence on protein kinase A (PKA). This study provides
      evidence that AVP can inhibit apoptosis through the V2 receptor and downstream
      cAMP-mediated pathways in mammalian kidney. The antiapoptotic action of AVP may
      be relevant to a number of physiological and pathophysiological conditions
      including osmotic tolerance in the inner medulla, escape from AVP-induced
      antidiuresis, and polycystic kidney disease.

TI  - Regulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor signalling and trafficking by Src
      and Eps8.
PG  - 613-24
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) mediate a wide spectrum of cellular
      responses that are crucial for development and wound healing. However, aberrant
      FGFR activity leads to cancer. Activated growth factor receptors undergo
      stimulated endocytosis, but can continue to signal along the endocytic pathway.
      Endocytic trafficking controls the duration and intensity of signalling, and
      growth factor receptor signalling can lead to modifications of trafficking
      pathways. We have developed live-cell imaging methods for studying FGFR dynamics 
      to investigate mechanisms that coordinate the interplay between receptor
      trafficking and signal transduction. Activated FGFR enters the cell following
      recruitment to pre-formed clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). However, FGFR activation
      stimulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis; FGF treatment increases the number of
      CCPs, including those undergoing endocytosis, and this effect is mediated by Src 
      and its phosphorylation target Eps8. Eps8 interacts with the clathrin-mediated
      endocytosis machinery and depletion of Eps8 inhibits FGFR trafficking and
      immediate Erk signalling. Once internalized, FGFR passes through peripheral early
      endosomes en route to recycling and degredative compartments, through an Src- and
      Eps8-dependent mechanism. Thus Eps8 functions as a key coordinator in the
      interplay between FGFR signalling and trafficking. This work provides the first
      detailed mechanistic analysis of growth factor receptor clustering at the cell
      surface through signal transduction and endocytic trafficking. As we have
      characterised the Src target Eps8 as a key regulator of FGFR signalling and
      trafficking, and identified the early endocytic system as the site of
      Eps8-mediated effects, this work provides novel mechanistic insight into the
      reciprocal regulation of growth factor receptor signalling and trafficking.

      in the intracellular domain of each protomer. Following activation by ligand
      binding, they selectively form phosphotyrosine residues by autocatalytic
      modification. Some of these sites are involved in maintaining the active
      conformation of the kinase, while others become docking sites for various
      adaptor/effector/scaffold proteins, which, after complexing with the receptor,
      then initiate further responses through cascades of post-translational
      modifications and the generation of lipid second messengers. Although there is
      substantial overlap in the pathways and activities stimulated by this
      superfamily, the molecular features of the endodomains of the sub-families and
      the moieties that they interact with to perpetrate their signals are surprisingly
      distinct, which may play a significant role in the regulation and responses of
      the individual RTK types. Some use large scaffold proteins as the basis for most,
      if not all, of their signal-generating interactions, while others have numerous
      receptor endodomain phosphotyrosine sites that are quite overlapping in
      specificity. The members of the Trk family of receptors each have several
      tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated following stimulation, including those 
      in the kinase activation loop, but there are only two established sites (Y490 and
      Y785 on TrkA) that are known to be directly involved in signal propagation.
      Taking advantage of this limited repertoire of docking sites, we have applied
      phosphoproteomic methods to dissect the signaling responses of both the native
      protein and derivatives that have had these two sites modified. Interestingly, a 
      clear subset that was not dependent on either docking site was identified. A
      comparison with a similar set of data for EGFR indicates a considerable degree of
      similarity in the downstream signaling profile between these two RTKs.

      Disease.
PG  - 159-92
AB  - Astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC) is a potent oncogene that regulates 
      key cellular processes underlying disease of the central nervous system (CNS).
      From its involvement in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection to its
      role in neurodegenerative disease and malignant brain tumors, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC
      facilitates cellular survival and proliferation through the control of a
      multitude of molecular signaling cascades. AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC induction by HIV-1
      and TNF highlights its importance in viral infection, and its incorporation into 
      viral vesicles supports its potential role in active viral replication.
      Overexpression of AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC in the brains of Huntington’s disease patients
      suggests its function in neurodegenerative disease, and its association with
      genetic polymorphisms in large genome-wide association studies of migraine
      patients suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of migraine headaches. In
      the field of cancer, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC promotes angiogenesis, migration, invasion,
      and enhanced tumor metabolism through key oncogenic signaling cascades. In
      response to external stress cues and cellular mechanisms to inhibit further
      growth, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC activates pathways that bypass cell checkpoints and
      potentiates signals to enhance survival and tumorigenesis. As an oncogene that
      promotes aberrant cellular processes within the CNS, AEG-1/MTDH/LYRIC represents 
      an important therapeutic target for the treatment of neurological disease.

TI  - Ecdysone Control of Developmental Transitions: Lessons from Drosophila Research.
PG  - 497-516
AB  - The steroid hormone ecdysone is the central regulator of insect developmental
      transitions. Recent new advances in our understanding of ecdysone action have
      relied heavily on the application of Drosophila melanogaster molecular genetic
      tools to study insect metamorphosis. In this review, we focus on three major
      aspects of Drosophila ecdysone biology: (a) factors that regulate the timing of
      ecdysone release, (b) molecular basis of stage- and tissue-specific responses to 
      ecdysone, and (c) feedback regulation and coordination of ecdysone signaling.

TI  - Stem Cell-based Tissue Engineering Approaches for Musculoskeletal Regeneration.
PG  - 3429-45
AB  - The field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering is an ever evolving
      field that holds promise in treating numerous musculoskeletal diseases and
      injuries. An important impetus in the development of the field was the discovery 
      and implementation of stem cells. The utilization of mesenchymal stem cells, and 
      later embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, opens new arenas for tissue
      engineering and presents the potential of developing stem cell-based therapies
      for disease treatment. Multipotent and pluripotent stem cells can produce various
      lineage tissues, and allow for derivation of a tissue that may be comprised of
      multiple cell types. As the field grows, the combination of biomaterial scaffolds
      and bioreactors provides methods to create an environment for stem cells that
      better represent their microenvironment for new tissue formation. As technologies
      for the fabrication of biomaterial scaffolds advance, the ability of scaffolds to
      modulate stem cell behavior advances as well. The composition of scaffolds could 
      be of natural or synthetic materials and could be tailored to enhance cell
      self-renewal and/or direct cell fates. In addition to biomaterial scaffolds,
      studies of tissue development and cellular microenvironments have determined
      other factors, such as growth factors and oxygen tension, that are crucial to the
      regulation of stem cell activity. The overarching goal of stem cell-based tissue 
      engineering research is to precisely control differentiation of stem cells in
      culture. In this article, we review current developments in tissue engineering,
      focusing on several stem cell sources, induction factors including growth
      factors, oxygen tension, biomaterials, and mechanical stimulation, and the
      internal and external regulatory mechanisms that govern proliferation and
      differentiation.

TI  - Developmental Checkpoints and Feedback Circuits Time Insect Maturation.
PG  - 1-33
AB  - The transition from juvenile to adult is a fundamental process that allows
      animals to allocate resource toward reproduction after completing a certain
      amount of growth. In insects, growth to a species-specific target size induces
      pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone that triggers metamorphosis and
      reproductive maturation. The past few years have seen significant progress in
      understanding the interplay of mechanisms that coordinate timing of ecdysone
      production and release. These studies show that the neuroendocrine system
      monitors complex size-related and nutritional signals, as well as external cues, 
      to time production and release of ecdysone. Based on results discussed here, we
      suggest that developmental progression to adulthood is controlled by checkpoints 
      that regulate the genetic timing program enabling it to adapt to different
      environmental conditions. These checkpoints utilize a number of signaling
      pathways to modulate ecdysone production in the prothoracic gland. Release of
      ecdysone activates an autonomous cascade of both feedforward and feedback signals
      that determine the duration of the ecdysone pulse at each developmental
      transitions. Conservation of the genetic mechanisms that coordinate the
      juvenile-adult transition suggests that insights from the fruit fly Drosophila
      will provide a framework for future investigation of developmental timing in
      metazoans.

TI  - Radiation Survivors: Understanding and exploiting the phenotype following
      fractionated radiation therapy.
PG  - 5-12
AB  - Radiation oncology modalities such as intensity-modulated and image-guided
      radiation therapy can reduce the high dose to normal tissue and deliver a
      heterogeneous dose to tumors focusing on areas deemed at highest risk for tumor
      persistence. Clinical radiation oncology produces daily doses ranging from 1 to
      20 Gy, with tissues being exposed to 30 or more daily fractions. Hypothesizing
      that cells that survive fractionated radiation therapy have a substantially
      different phenotype than the untreated cells, which might be exploitable for
      targeting with molecular therapeutics or immunotherapy, three prostate cancer
      cell lines (PC3, DU145 and LNCaP) and normal endothelial cells were studied to
      understand the biology of differential effects of multi-fraction (MF) radiation
      of 0.5, 1 and/or 2 Gy fraction to 10 Gy total dose, and a single dose (SD) of 5
      and 10 Gy. The resulting changes in mRNA, miRNA and phosphoproteome were
      analyzed. Significant differences were observed in the MF radiation exposures
      including those from the 0.5 Gy MF that produces little cell killing. As
      expected, p53 function played a major role in response. Pathways modified by MF
      include immune response, DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, TGF-β, survival and
      apoptotic signal transduction. The radiation-induced stress response will
      set-forth a unique platform for exploiting the effects of radiation therapy as
      “focused biology” for cancer treatment in conjunction with molecular targeted or 
      immunologically directed therapy. Given that more normal tissue is treated,
      albeit to lower doses with these newer techniques, the response of the normal
      tissue may also influence long-term treatment outcome.

TI  - Quantitative Proteomics with siRNA Screening Identifies Novel Mechanisms of
      Trastuzumab Resistance in HER2 Amplified Breast Cancers*.
PG  - 180-93
AB  - HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in 20% to 30% of human
      breast cancers and which affects patient prognosis and survival. Treatment of
      HER2-positive breast cancer with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) 
      has improved patient survival, but the development of trastuzumab resistance is a
      major medical problem. Many of the known mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance
      cause changes in protein phosphorylation patterns, and therefore quantitative
      proteomics was used to examine phosphotyrosine signaling networks in
      trastuzumab-resistant cells. The model system used in this study was two pairs of
      trastuzumab-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer cell lines. Using stable
      isotope labeling, phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations, and online TiO2
      chromatography utilizing a dual trap configuration, ∼1700 proteins were
      quantified. Comparing quantified proteins between the two cell line pairs showed 
      only a small number of common protein ratio changes, demonstrating heterogeneity 
      in phosphotyrosine signaling networks across different trastuzumab-resistant
      cancers. Proteins showing significant increases in resistant versus sensitive
      cells were subjected to a focused siRNA screen to evaluate their functional
      relevance to trastuzumab resistance. The screen revealed proteins related to the 
      Src kinase pathway, such as CDCP1/Trask, embryonal Fyn substrate, and Paxillin.
      We also identify several novel proteins that increased trastuzumab sensitivity in
      resistant cells when targeted by siRNAs, including FAM83A and MAPK1. These
      proteins may present targets for the development of clinical diagnostics or
      therapeutic strategies to guide the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer patients who
      develop trastuzumab resistance.

TI  - Structural, molecular and cellular functions of MSH2 and MSH6 during DNA mismatch
      repair, damage signaling and other noncanonical activities.
PG  - 53-66
AB  - The field of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) has rapidly expanded after the discovery
      of the MutHLS repair system in bacteria. By the mid 1990s yeast and human
      homologues to bacterial MutL and MutS had been identified and their contribution 
      to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; Lynch Syndrome) was under
      intense investigation. The human MutS homologue 6 protein (hMSH6), was first
      reported in 1995 as a G:T binding partner (GTBP) of hMSH2, forming the hMutSα
      mismatch-binding complex. Signal transduction from each DNA-bound hMutSα complex 
      is accomplished by the hMutLα heterodimer (hMLH1 and hPMS2). Molecular mechanisms
      and cellular regulation of individual MMR proteins are now areas of intensive
      research. This review will focus on molecular mechanisms associated with mismatch
      binding, as well as emerging evidence that MutSα and in particular, MSH6, is a
      key protein in MMR-dependent DNA damage response and communication with other DNA
      repair pathways within the cell. MSH6 is unstable in the absence of MSH2, however
      it is the DNA lesion-binding partner of this heterodimer. MSH6, but not MSH2, has
      a conserved Phe-X-Glu motif that recognizes and binds several different DNA
      structural distortions, initiating different cellular responses. hMSH6 also
      contains the nuclear localization sequences required to shuttle hMutSα into the
      nucleus. For example, upon binding to O6meG:T, MSH6 triggers a DNA damage
      response that involves altered phosphorylation within the N-terminal disordered
      domain of this unique protein. While many investigations have focused on MMR as a
      post-replication DNA repair mechanism, MMR proteins are expressed and active in
      all phases of the cell cycle. There is much more to be discovered about
      regulatory cellular roles that require the presence of MutSα and, in particular, 
      MSH6.

PG  - 2617
AB  - Global ‘multi-omics’ profiling of cancer cells harbours the potential for
      characterizing the signaling networks associated with specific oncogenes. Here we
      profile the transcriptome, proteome and phosphoproteome in a panel of non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines in order to reconstruct targetable networks
      associated with KRAS dependency. We develop a two-step bioinformatics strategy
      addressing the challenge of integrating these disparate data sets. We first
      define an ‘abundance-score’ combining transcript, protein and phospho-protein
      abundances to nominate differentially abundant proteins and then use the Prize
      Collecting Steiner Tree algorithm to identify functional sub-networks. We
      identify three modules centered on KRAS and MET, LCK and PAK1 and b-Catenin. We
      validate activation of these proteins in KRAS-dependent (KRAS-Dep) cells and
      perform functional studies defining LCK as a critical gene for cell proliferation
      in KRAS-Dep but not KRAS-independent NSCLCs. These results suggest that LCK is a 
      potential druggable target protein in KRAS-Dep lung cancers.

TI  - Analysis of SRC Oncogenic Signaling in Colorectal Cancer by Stable Isotope
      Labeling with Heavy Amino Acids in Mouse Xenografts*.
PG  - 1937-50
AB  - The non-receptor tyrosine kinase SRC is frequently deregulated in human
      colorectal cancer (CRC), and SRC increased activity has been associated with poor
      clinical outcomes. In nude mice engrafted with human CRC cells, SRC
      over-expression favors tumor growth and is accompanied by a robust increase in
      tyrosine phosphorylation in tumor cells. How SRC contributes to this tumorigenic 
      process is largely unknown. We analyzed SRC oncogenic signaling in these tumors
      by means of a novel quantitative proteomic analysis. This method is based on
      stable isotope labeling with amino acids of xenograft tumors by the addition of
      [13C6]-lysine into mouse food. An incorporation level greater than 88% was
      obtained in xenograft tumors after 30 days of the heavy lysine diet. Quantitative
      phosphoproteomic analysis of these tumors allowed the identification of 61
      proteins that exhibited a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation and/or
      association with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins upon SRC expression. These
      mainly included molecules implicated in vesicular trafficking and signaling and
      RNA binding proteins. Most of these proteins were specific targets of SRC
      signaling in vivo, as they were not identified by analysis via stable isotope
      labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) of the same CRC cells in culture.
      This suggests that oncogenic signaling induced by SRC in tumors significantly
      differs from that induced by SRC in cell culture. We next confirmed this notion
      experimentally with the example of the vesicular trafficking protein and SRC
      substrate TOM1L1. We found that whereas TOM1L1 depletion only slightly affected
      SRC-induced proliferation of CRC cells in vitro, it drastically decreased tumor
      growth in xenografted nude mice. We thus concluded that this vesicular
      trafficking protein plays an important role in SRC-induced tumor growth. Overall,
      these data show that SILAC analysis in mouse xenografts is a valuable approach
      for deciphering tyrosine kinase oncogenic signaling in vivo.

TI  - Phosphoproteome of Pristionchus pacificus Provides Insights into Architecture of 
      Signaling Networks in Nematode Models*.
PG  - 1631-9
AB  - Pristionchus pacificus is a nematode that is increasingly used as a model
      organism in evolutionary biology. The genome of P. pacificus differs markedly
      from that of C. elegans, with a high number of orphan genes that are restricted
      to P. pacificus and have no homologs in other species. To gain insight into the
      architecture of signal transduction networks in model nematodes, we performed a
      large-scale qualitative phosphoproteome analysis of P. pacificus. Using two-stage
      enrichment of phosphopeptides from a digest of P. pacificus proteins and their
      subsequent analysis via high accuracy MS, we detected and localized 6,809
      phosphorylation events on 2,508 proteins. We compared the detected P. pacificus
      phosphoproteome to the recently published phosphoproteome of C. elegans. The
      overall numbers and functional classes of phosphoproteins were similar between
      the two organisms. Interestingly, the products of orphan genes were significantly
      underrepresented among the detected P. pacificus phosphoproteins. We defined the 
      theoretical kinome of P. pacificus and compared it to that of C. elegans. While
      tyrosine kinases were slightly underrepresented in the kinome of P. pacificus,
      all major classes of kinases were present in both organisms. Application of our
      kinome annotation to a recent transcriptomic study of dauer and mixed stage
      populations showed that Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases show similar expression levels in
      P. pacificus but not in C. elegans. This study presents the first systematic
      comparison of phosphoproteomes and kinomes of two model nematodes and, as such,
      will be a useful resource for comparative studies of their signal transduction
      networks.

TI  - Quantitative phosphoproteomics in nuclei of vasopressin-sensitive renal
      collecting duct cells.
PG  - C1006-20
AB  - Vasopressin regulates transport across the collecting duct epithelium in part via
      effects on gene transcription. Transcriptional regulation occurs partially via
      changes in phosphorylation of transcription factors, transcriptional
      coactivators, and protein kinases in the nucleus. To test whether vasopressin
      alters the nuclear phosphoproteome of vasopressin-sensitive cultured mouse mpkCCD
      cells, we used stable isotope labeling and mass spectrometry to quantify
      thousands of phosphorylation sites in nuclear extracts and nuclear pellet
      fractions. Measurements were made in the presence and absence of the vasopressin 
      analog dDAVP. Of the 1,251 sites quantified, 39 changed significantly in response
      to dDAVP. Network analysis of the regulated proteins revealed two major clusters 
      (“cell-cell adhesion” and “transcriptional regulation”) that were connected to
      known elements of the vasopressin signaling pathway. The hub proteins for these
      two clusters were the transcriptional coactivator β-catenin and the transcription
      factor c-Jun. Phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser552 was increased by dDAVP
      [log2(dDAVP/vehicle) = 1.79], and phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser73 was decreased
      [log2(dDAVP/vehicle) = −0.53]. The β-catenin site is known to be targeted by
      either protein kinase A or Akt, both of which are activated in response to
      vasopressin. The c-Jun site is a canonical target for the MAP kinase Jnk2, which 
      is downregulated in response to vasopressin in the collecting duct. The data
      support the idea that vasopressin-mediated control of transcription in collecting
      duct cells involves selective changes in the nuclear phosphoproteome. All data
      are available to users at http://helixweb.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/mNPPD/.

TI  - Multiscale Models of Cell Signaling.
PG  - 2319-27
AB  - Computational models of signal transduction face challenges of scale below the
      resolution of a single cell. Here, we organize these challenges around three key 
      interfaces for multiscale models of cell signaling: molecules to pathways,
      pathways to networks, and networks to outcomes. Each interface requires its own
      set of computational approaches and systems-level data, and no single approach or
      dataset can effectively bridge all three interfaces. This suggests that realistic
      “whole-cell” models of signaling will need to agglomerate different model types
      that span critical intracellular scales. Future multiscale models will be
      valuable for understanding the impact of signaling mutations or population
      variants that lead to cellular diseases such as cancer.

TI  - Posttranslational Modifications of the Retinoblastoma Tumor Suppressor Protein as
      Determinants of Function.
PG  - 619-33
AB  - The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) plays an integral role in G1-S 
      checkpoint control and consequently is a frequent target for inactivation in
      cancer. The RB protein can function as an adaptor, nucleating components such as 
      E2Fs and chromatin regulating enzymes into the same complex. For this reason,
      pRB’s regulation by posttranslational modifications is thought to be critical.
      pRB is phosphorylated by a number of different kinases such as cyclin dependent
      kinases (Cdks), p38 MAP kinase, Chk1/2, Abl, and Aurora b. Although
      phosphorylation of pRB by Cdks has been extensively studied, activities regulated
      through phosphorylation by other kinases are just starting to be understood. As
      well as being phosphorylated, pRB is acetylated, methylated, ubiquitylated, and
      SUMOylated. Acetylation, methylation, and SUMOylation play roles in pRB mediated 
      gene silencing. Ubiquitinylation of pRB promotes its degradation and may be used 
      to regulate apoptosis. Recent proteomic data have revealed that pRB is
      posttranslationally modified to a much greater extent than previously thought.
      This new information suggests that many unknown pathways affect pRB regulation.
      This review focuses on posttranslational modifications of pRB and how they
      influence its function. The final part of the review summarizes new
      phosphorylation sites from accumulated proteomic data and discusses the
      possibilities that might arise from this data.

TI  - Flipping the Switch from G1 to S Phase with E3 Ubiquitin Ligases.
PG  - 634-48
AB  - The cell cycle ensures genome maintenance by coordinating the processes of DNA
      replication and chromosome segregation. Of particular importance is the
      irreversible transition from the G1 phase of the cell cycle to S phase. This
      transition marks the switch from preparing chromosomes for replication (“origin
      licensing”) to active DNA synthesis (“origin firing”). Ubiquitin-mediated
      proteolysis is essential for restricting DNA replication to only once per cell
      cycle and is the major mechanism regulating the G1 to S phase transition.
      Although some changes in protein levels are attributable to regulated mRNA
      abundance, protein degradation elicits very rapid changes in protein abundance
      and is critical for the sharp and irreversible transition from one cell cycle
      stage to the next. Not surprisingly, regulation of the G1-to-S phase transition
      is perturbed in most cancer cells, and deregulation of key molecular events in G1
      and S phase drives not only cell proliferation but also genome instability. In
      this review we focus on the mechanisms by which E3 ubiquitin ligases control the 
      irreversible transition from G1 to S phase in mammalian cells.

TI  - Phosphorylation of the Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4E-Transporter
      (4E-T) by c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase Promotes Stress-Dependent P-Body Assembly.
PG  - 4572-84
AB  - Processing bodies (PBs, or P bodies) are cytoplasmic granules involved in mRNA
      storage and degradation that participate in the regulation of gene expression.
      PBs concentrate nontranslated mRNAs and several factors involved in mRNA decay
      and translational repression, including the eukaryotic translation initiation
      factor 4E-transporter (4E-T). 4E-T is required for PB assembly, but little is
      known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate its function. Here, we
      demonstrate that oxidative stress promotes multisite 4E-T phosphorylation. We
      show that the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is targeted to PBs in response to
      oxidative stress and promotes the phosphorylation of 4E-T. Quantitative mass
      spectrometry analysis reveals that JNK phosphorylates 4E-T on six
      proline-directed sites that are required for the formation of the 4E-T complex
      upon stress. We have developed an image-based computational method to quantify
      the size, number, and density of PBs in cells, and we find that while 4E-T is
      required for steady-state PB assembly, its phosphorylation facilitates the
      formation of larger PBs upon oxidative stress. Using polysomal mRNA profiling, we
      assessed global and specific mRNA translation but did not find that 4E-T
      phosphorylation impacts translational control. Collectively, these data support a
      model whereby PB assembly is regulated by a two-step mechanism involving a
      4E-T-dependent assembly stage in unstressed cells and a 4E-T
      phosphorylation-dependent aggregation stage in response to stress stimuli.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Soybean Root Hairs Inoculated with
      Bradyrhizobium japonicum*.
PG  - 1140-55
AB  - Root hairs are single hair-forming cells on roots that function to increase root 
      surface area, enhancing water and nutrient uptake. In leguminous plants, root
      hairs also play a critical role as the site of infection by symbiotic nitrogen
      fixing rhizobia, leading to the formation of a novel organ, the nodule. The
      initial steps in the rhizobia-root hair infection process are known to involve
      specific receptor kinases and subsequent kinase cascades. Here, we characterize
      the phosphoproteome of the root hairs and the corresponding stripped roots (i.e. 
      roots from which root hairs were removed) during rhizobial colonization and
      infection to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of root hair cell biology.
      We chose soybean (Glycine max L.), one of the most important crop plants in the
      legume family, for this study because of its larger root size, which permits
      isolation of sufficient root hair material for phosphoproteomic analysis.
      Phosphopeptides derived from root hairs and stripped roots, mock inoculated or
      inoculated with the soybean-specific rhizobium Bradyrhizobium japonicum, were
      labeled with the isobaric tag eight-plex iTRAQ, enriched using Ni-NTA magnetic
      beads and subjected to nanoRPLC-MS/MS1 analysis using HCD and decision tree
      guided CID/ETD strategy. A total of 1625 unique phosphopeptides, spanning 1659
      nonredundant phosphorylation sites, were detected from 1126 soybean
      phosphoproteins. Among them, 273 phosphopeptides corresponding to 240
      phosphoproteins were found to be significantly regulated (>1.5-fold abundance
      change) in response to inoculation with B. japonicum. The data reveal unique
      features of the soybean root hair phosphoproteome, including root hair and
      stripped root-specific phosphorylation suggesting a complex network of
      kinase-substrate and phosphatase-substrate interactions in response to rhizobial 
      inoculation.

TI  - Modified SH2 domain to phototrap and identify phosphotyrosine proteins from
      subcellular sites within cells.
PG  - E2929-38
AB  - Spatial regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation is important for many aspects of
      cell biology. However, phosphotyrosine accounts for less than 1% of all
      phosphorylated substrates, and it is typically a very transient event in vivo.
      These factors complicate the identification of key tyrosine kinase substrates,
      especially in the context of their extraordinary spatial organization. Here, we
      describe an approach to identify tyrosine kinase substrates based on their
      subcellular distribution from within cells. This method uses an unnatural amino
      acid-modified Src homology 2 (SH2) domain that is expressed within cells and can 
      covalently trap phosphotyrosine proteins on exposure to light. This SH2
      domain-based photoprobe was targeted to cellular structures, such as the actin
      cytoskeleton, mitochondria, and cellular membranes, to capture tyrosine kinase
      substrates unique to each cellular region. We demonstrate that RhoA, one of the
      proteins associated with actin, can be phosphorylated on two tyrosine residues
      within the switch regions, suggesting that phosphorylation of these residues
      might modulate RhoA signaling to the actin cytoskeleton. We conclude that
      expression of SH2 domains within cellular compartments that are capable of
      covalent phototrapping can reveal the spatial organization of tyrosine kinase
      substrates that are likely to be important for the regulation of subcellular
      structures.

      Molecular Targets, and Therapeutic Promise.
PG  - 2036-53
AB  - All cells have developed various mechanisms to respond and adapt to a variety of 
      environmental challenges, including stresses that damage cellular proteins. One
      such response, the heat shock response (HSR), leads to the transcriptional
      activation of a family of molecular chaperone proteins that promote proper
      folding or clearance of damaged proteins within the cytosol. In addition to its
      role in protection against acute insults, the HSR also regulates lifespan and
      protects against protein misfolding that is associated with degenerative diseases
      of aging. As a result, identifying pharmacological regulators of the HSR has
      become an active area of research in recent years. Here, we review progress made 
      in identifying small molecule activators of the HSR, what cellular targets these 
      compounds interact with to drive response activation, and how such molecules may 
      ultimately be employed to delay or reverse protein misfolding events that
      contribute to a number of diseases.

TI  - Comprehensive molecular portraits of human breast tumors.
PG  - 61-70
AB  - We analyzed primary breast cancers by genomic DNA copy number arrays, DNA
      methylation, exome sequencing, mRNA arrays, microRNA sequencing and reverse phase
      protein arrays. Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided
      key insights into previously-defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated
      the existence of four main breast cancer classes when combining data from five
      platforms, each of which shows significant molecular heterogeneity. Somatic
      mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at > 10%
      incidence across all breast cancers; however, there were numerous
      subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific 
      mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the Luminal A subtype. We identified
      two novel protein expression-defined subgroups, possibly contributed by
      stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific 
      signaling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a
      HER2/p-HER2/HER1/p-HER1 signature within the HER2-Enriched expression subtype.
      Comparison of Basal-like breast tumors with high-grade Serous Ovarian tumors
      showed many molecular commonalities, suggesting a related etiology and similar
      therapeutic opportunities. The biologic finding of the four main breast cancer
      subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities
      raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and
      heterogeneity occurs within, and not across, these major biologic subtypes of
      breast cancer.

PG  - 16190-5
AB  - Hypothesis directed proteomics offers higher throughput over global analyses. We 
      show that immunoprecipitation (IP)–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in H929
      multiple myeloma (MM) cancer cells led to the discovery of a rare and unexpected 
      BCR–ABL fusion, informing a therapeutic intervention using imatinib (Gleevec).
      BCR–ABL is the driving mutation in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and is uncommon
      to other cancers. Three different IP–MS experiments central to cell signaling
      pathways were sufficient to discover a BCR–ABL fusion in H929 cells:
      phosphotyrosine (pY) peptide IP, p85 regulatory subunit of
      phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) IP, and the GRB2 adaptor IP. The pY peptides
      inform tyrosine kinase activity, p85 IP informs the activating adaptors and
      receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) involved in AKT activation and GRB2 IP
      identifies RTKs and adaptors leading to ERK activation. Integration of the
      bait–prey data from the three separate experiments identified the BCR–ABL protein
      complex, which was confirmed by biochemistry, cytogenetic methods, and DNA
      sequencing revealed the e14a2 fusion transcript. The tyrosine phosphatase SHP2
      and the GAB2 adaptor protein, important for MAPK signaling, were common to all
      three IP–MS experiments. The comparative treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      (TKI) drugs revealed only imatinib, the standard of care in CML, was inhibitory
      to BCR–ABL leading to down-regulation of pERK and pS6K and inhibiting cell
      proliferation. These data suggest a model for directed proteomics from patient
      tumor samples for selecting the appropriate TKI drug(s) based on IP and LC-MS/MS.
      The data also suggest that MM patients, in addition to CML patients, may benefit 
      from BCR–ABL diagnostic screening.

      discovery of BCAP as a TLR signaling adaptor, crucial for linking TLRs to PI3K
      activation, allows new questions of the importance of PI3K activation downstream 
      of TLRs. Here, we summarize the current understanding of signaling pathways
      activated by TLRs and provide our perspective on TLR mediated activation of PI3K 
      and its impact on regulating cellular processes.

TI  - Polar opposites: fine-tuning cytokinesis through SIN asymmetry.
PG  - 686-99
AB  - Mitotic exit and cell division must be spatially and temporally integrated to
      facilitate equal division of genetic material between daughter cells. In the
      fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a spindle pole body (SPB) localized
      signaling cascade termed the septation initiation network (SIN) couples mitotic
      exit with cytokinesis. The SIN is controlled at many levels to ensure that
      cytokinesis is executed once per cell cycle and only after cells segregate their 
      DNA. An interesting facet of the SIN is that its activity is asymmetric on the
      two SPBs during anaphase; however, how and why the SIN is asymmetric has remained
      elusive. Many key factors controlling SIN asymmetry have now been identified,
      shedding light on the significance of SIN asymmetry in regulating cytokinesis. In
      this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of SIN regulation,
      with an emphasis on how SIN asymmetry is achieved and how this aspect of SIN
      regulation fine-tunes cytokinesis.

TI  - Label-free Quantitative Proteomics and N-Glycoproteomics Analysis of
      KRAS-activated Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells*.
PG  - 901-15
AB  - Mutational activation of KRAS promotes various malignancies, including lung
      adenocarcinoma. Knowledge of the molecular targets mediating the downstream
      effects of activated KRAS is limited. Here, we provide the KRAS target proteins
      and N-glycoproteins using human bronchial epithelial cells with and without the
      expression of activated KRAS (KRASV12). Using an OFFGEL peptide fractionation and
      hydrazide method combined with subsequent LTQ-Orbitrap analysis, we identified
      5713 proteins and 608 N-glycosites on 317 proteins in human bronchial epithelial 
      cells. Label-free quantitation of 3058 proteins (≥2 peptides; coefficient of
      variation (CV) ≤ 20%) and 297 N-glycoproteins (CV ≤ 20%) revealed the
      differential regulation of 23 proteins and 14 N-glycoproteins caused by activated
      KRAS, including 84% novel ones. An informatics-assisted IPA-Biomarker® filter
      analysis prioritized some of the differentially regulated proteins (ALDH3A1, CA2,
      CTSD, DST, EPHA2, and VIM) and N-glycoproteins (ALCAM, ITGA3, and TIMP-1) as
      cancer biomarkers. Further, integrated in silico analysis of microarray
      repository data of lung adenocarcinoma clinical samples and cell lines containing
      KRAS mutations showed positive mRNA fold changes (p < 0.05) for 61% of the
      KRAS-regulated proteins, including biomarker proteins, CA2 and CTSD. The most
      significant discovery of the integrated validation is the down-regulation of
      FABP5 and PDCD4. A few validated proteins, including tumor suppressor PDCD4, were
      further confirmed as KRAS targets by shRNA-based knockdown experiments. Finally, 
      the studies on KRAS-regulated N-glycoproteins revealed structural alterations in 
      the core N-glycans of SEMA4B in KRAS-activated human bronchial epithelial cells
      and functional role of N-glycosylation of TIMP-1 in the regulation of lung
      adenocarcinoma A549 cell invasion. Together, our study represents the largest
      proteome and N-glycoproteome data sets for HBECs, which we used to identify
      several novel potential targets of activated KRAS that may provide insights into 
      KRAS-induced adenocarcinoma and have implications for both lung cancer therapy
      and diagnosis.

TI  - Exosomes as Biomarker Enriched Microvesicles: Characterization of Exosomal
      Proteins Derived from a Panel of Prostate Cell Lines with Distinct AR Phenotypes.
PG  - 863-85
AB  - Prostate cancer is the leading type of cancer diagnosed in men. In 2010, ∼217,730
      new cases of prostate cancer were reported in the United States. Prompt diagnosis
      of the disease can substantially improve its clinical outcome. Improving
      capability for early detection, as well as developing new therapeutic targets in 
      advanced disease are research priorities that will ultimately lead to better
      patient survival. Eukaryotic cells secrete proteins via distinct regulated
      mechanisms which are either ER/Golgi dependent or microvesicle mediated. The
      release of microvesicles has been shown to provide a novel mechanism for
      intercellular communication. Exosomes are nanometer sized cup-shaped membrane
      vesicles which are secreted from normal and cancerous cells. They are present in 
      various biological fluids and are rich in characteristic proteins. Exosomes may
      thus have potential both in facilitating early diagnosis via less invasive
      procedures or be candidates for novel therapeutic approaches for castration
      resistance prostate cancer. Because exosomes have been shown previously to have a
      role in cell-cell communication in the local tumor microenvironment, conferring
      activation of numerous survival mechanisms, we characterized constitutive lipids,
      cholesterol and proteins from exosomes derived from six prostate cell lines and
      tracked their uptake in both cancerous and benign prostate cell lines
      respectively. Our comprehensive proteomic and lipidomic analysis of prostate
      derived exosomes could provide insight for future work on both biomarker and
      therapeutic targets for the treatment of prostate cancer.

TI  - Quantitative- and Phospho-Proteomic Analysis of the Yeast Response to the
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Imatinib to Pharmacoproteomics-Guided Drug Line
      Extension.
PG  - 537-51
AB  - Imatinib mesylate (IM) is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as front-line
      therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia, a disease caused by the oncogenic kinase
      Bcr-Abl. Although the clinical success of IM set a new paradigm in
      molecular-targeted therapy, the emergence of IM resistance is a clinically
      significant problem. In an effort to obtain new insights into the mechanisms of
      adaptation and tolerance to IM, as well as the signaling pathways potentially
      affected by this drug, we performed a two-dimensional electrophoresis-based
      quantitative- and phospho-proteomic analysis in the eukaryotic model
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We singled out proteins that were either differentially
      expressed or differentially phosphorylated in response to IM, using the
      phosphoselective dye Pro-Q® Diamond, and identified 18 proteins in total. Ten
      were altered only at the content level (mostly decreased), while the remaining 8 
      possessed IM-repressed phosphorylation. These 18 proteins are mainly involved in 
      cellular carbohydrate processes (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis), translation,
      protein folding, ion homeostasis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism.
      Remarkably, all 18 proteins have human functional homologs. A role for HSP70
      proteins in the response to IM, as well as decreased glycolysis as a metabolic
      marker of IM action are suggested, consistent with findings from studies in human
      cell lines. The previously-proposed effect of IM as an inhibitor of vacuolar
      H+-ATPase function was supported by the identification of an underexpressed
      protein subunit of this complex. Taken together, these findings reinforce the
      role of yeast as a valuable eukaryotic model for pharmacological studies and
      identification of new drug targets, with potential clinical implications in drug 
      reassignment or line extension under a personalized medicine perspective.

TI  - An evolutionary perspective on the kinome of malaria parasites.
PG  - 2607-18
AB  - Malaria parasites belong to an ancient lineage that diverged very early from the 
      main branch of eukaryotes. The approximately 90-member plasmodial kinome includes
      a majority of eukaryotic protein kinases that clearly cluster within the AGC,
      CMGC, TKL, CaMK and CK1 groups found in yeast, plants and mammals, testifying to 
      the ancient ancestry of these families. However, several hundred millions years
      of independent evolution, and the specific pressures brought about by first a
      photosynthetic and then a parasitic lifestyle, led to the emergence of unique
      features in the plasmodial kinome. These include taxon-restricted kinase
      families, and unique peculiarities of individual enzymes even when they have
      homologues in other eukaryotes. Here, we merge essential aspects of all three
      malaria-related communications that were presented at the Evolution of Protein
      Phosphorylation meeting, and propose an integrated discussion of the specific
      features of the parasite's kinome and phosphoproteome.

TI  - Perifosine enhances mTORC1-targeted cancer therapy by activation of GSK3β in
      NSCLC cells.
PG  - 1009-17
AB  - mTORC1 inhibitors, including rapamycin and its analogs, have been actively
      studied both pre-clinically and clinically. However, the single treatment of
      mTORC1 inhibitors has been modest in most cancer types. We have previously
      demonstrated that the activation of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling pathways
      attenuates the anticancer efficacy of mTORC1 inhibitors. In this study, we report
      that mTORC1 inhibition also phosphorylates and inactivates GSK3β, which is a
      tumor suppressor in lung cancer. Moreover, we show that perifosine, as an Akt
      inhibitor, decreases rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β and elevated
      p-GSK3β levels in rapamycin-resistant cell lines. Combination of perifosine with 
      mTORC1 inhibitors showed enhanced anticancer efficacy both in cell cultures and
      in a xenograft mouse model. In addition, perifosine inhibits the growth of both
      rapamycin sensitive and resistant A549 cells. However, inhibition of GSK3β by a
      selective inhibitor- LiCl, or downregulation of GSK3β expression by siRNA,
      reverses the growth inhibitory effects of perifosine on rapamycin resistant
      cells, suggesting the important role of GSK3β activation in enhancing mTORC1
      inhibitors efficacy by perifosine. Thus, our results provide a potential
      therapeutic strategy to enhance mTORC1-targeted cancer therapy by using
      perifosine or targeting GSK3β.

TI  - Model systems for studying trophoblast differentiation from human pluripotent
      stem cells.
PG  - 809-24
AB  - This review focuses on a now well-established model for generating cells of the
      trophoblast (TB) lineage by treating human embryonic stem cells (ESC) and induced
      pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) with the growth factor BMP4. We first discuss the
      opposing roles of FGF2 and BMP4 in directing TB formation and the need to exclude
      the former from the growth medium to minimize the co-induction of mesoderm and
      endoderm. Under these conditions, there is up-regulation of several transcription
      factors implicated in TB lineage emergence within 3 h of BMP4 exposure and, over 
      a period of days and especially under a high O2 gas atmosphere, gradual
      appearance of cell types carrying markers for more differentiated TB cell types, 
      including extravillous TB and syncytioTB. We describe the potential value of
      including low molecular weight pharmaceutical agents that block activin A (INHBA)
      and FGF2 signaling to support BMP4-directed differentiation. We contend that the 
      weight of available evidence supports the contention that BMP4 converts human ESC
      and iPSC of the so-called epiblast type unidirectionally to TB. We also consider 
      the argument that BMP4 treatment of human ESC in the absence of exogenous FGF2
      leads only to the emergence of mesoderm derivatives to be seriously flawed.
      Instead, we propose that, when signaling networks supporting pluripotency ESC or 
      iPSC become unsustainable and when specification towards extra-embryonic mesoderm
      and endoderm are rendered inoperative, TB emerges as a major default state to
      pluripotency.

TI  - Phosphosignature Predicts Dasatinib Response in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer*.
PG  - 651-68
AB  - Targeted drugs are less toxic than traditional chemotherapeutic therapies;
      however, the proportion of patients that benefit from these drugs is often
      smaller. A marker that confidently predicts patient response to a specific
      therapy would allow an individual therapy selection most likely to benefit the
      patient. Here, we used quantitative mass spectrometry to globally profile the
      basal phosphoproteome of a panel of non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. The
      effect of the kinase inhibitor dasatinib on cellular growth was tested against
      the same panel. From the phosphoproteome profiles, we identified 58
      phosphorylation sites, which consistently differ between sensitive and resistant 
      cell lines. Many of the corresponding proteins are involved in cell adhesion and 
      cytoskeleton organization. We showed that a signature of only 12 phosphorylation 
      sites is sufficient to accurately predict dasatinib sensitivity. Four of the
      phosphorylation sites belong to integrin β4, a protein that mediates cell-matrix 
      or cell-cell adhesion. The signature was validated in cross-validation and label 
      switch experiments and in six independently profiled breast cancer cell lines.
      The study supports that the phosphorylation of integrin β4, as well as eight
      further proteins comprising the signature, are candidate biomarkers for
      predicting response to dasatinib in solid tumors. Furthermore, our results show
      that identifying predictive phosphorylation signatures from global, quantitative 
      phosphoproteomic data is possible and can open a new path to discovering
      molecular markers for response prediction.

TI  - Fast rebinding increases dwell time of Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing proteins
      near the plasma membrane.
PG  - 14024-9
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) control a host of biological functions by
      phosphorylating tyrosine residues of intracellular proteins upon extracellular
      ligand binding. The phosphotyrosines (p-Tyr) then recruit a subset of ∼100 Src
      homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins to the cell membrane. The in vivo
      kinetics of this process are not well understood. Here we use total internal
      reflection (TIR) microscopy and single-molecule imaging to monitor interactions
      between SH2 modules and p-Tyr sites near the cell membrane. We found that the
      dwell time of SH2 modules within the TIR illumination field is significantly
      longer than predictions based on chemical dissociation rate constants, suggesting
      that SH2 modules quickly rebind to nearby p-Tyr sites after dissociation. We also
      found that, consistent with the rebinding model, the effective diffusion constant
      is negatively correlated with the respective dwell time for different SH2 domains
      and the dwell time is positively correlated with the local density of RTK
      phosphorylation. These results suggest a mechanism whereby signal output can be
      regulated through the spatial organization of multiple binding sites, which will 
      prompt reevaluation of many aspects of RTK signaling, such as signaling
      specificity, mechanisms of spatial control, and noise suppression.

TI  - Cell cycle regulation of Rho signaling pathways.
PG  - 3003-10
AB  - The dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and its regulation by Rho GTPases are
      essential to maintain cell shape, to allow cell motility and are also critical
      during cell cycle progression and mitosis. Rho GTPases and their effectors are
      involved in cell rounding at mitosis onset, in chromosomes alignment and are
      required for contraction of the actomyosin ring that separates daughter cells at 
      the end of mitosis. Recent studies have revealed how a number of nucleotide
      exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins regulate the activity of Rho
      GTPases during these processes. This review will focus on how the cell cycle
      machinery, in turn, regulates expression of proteins in the Rho signaling
      pathways through transcriptional activation, ubiquitylation and proteasomal
      degradation and modulates their activity through phosphorylation by mitotic
      kinases.

TI  - Human T-lymphotropic virus proteins and post-translational modification pathways.
PG  - 115-30
AB  - Cell life from the cell cycle to the signaling transduction and response to
      stimuli is finely tuned by protein post-translational modifications (PTMs). PTMs 
      alter the conformation, the stability, the localization, and hence the pattern of
      interactions of the targeted protein. Cell pathways involve the activation of
      enzymes, like kinases, ligases and transferases, that, once activated, act on
      many proteins simultaneously, altering the state of the cell and triggering the
      processes they are involved in. Viruses enter a balanced system and hijack the
      cell, exploiting the potential of PTMs either to activate viral encoded proteins 
      or to alter cellular pathways, with the ultimate consequence to perpetuate
      through their replication. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is known to
      be highly oncogenic and associates with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma,
      HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and other inflammatory 
      pathological conditions. HTLV-1 protein activity is controlled by PTMs and, in
      turn, viral activity is associated with the modulation of cellular pathways based
      on PTMs. More knowledge is acquired about the PTMs involved in the activation of 
      its proteins, like Tax, Rex, p12, p13, p30, HTLV-I basic leucine zipper factor
      and Gag. However, more has to be understood at the biochemical level in order to 
      counteract the associated fatal outcomes. This review will focus on known PTMs
      that directly modify HTLV-1 components and on enzymes whose activity is modulated
      by viral proteins.

TI  - Identification of Targets of c-Src Tyrosine Kinase by Chemical Complementation
      and Phosphoproteomics*.
PG  - 355-69
AB  - The cellular proto-oncogene c-Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in
      cell growth and cytoskeletal regulation. Despite being dysregulated in a variety 
      of human cancers, its precise functions are not fully understood. Identification 
      of the substrates of c-Src remains a major challenge, because there is no simple 
      way to directly stimulate its activity. Here we combine the chemical rescue of
      mutant c-Src and global quantitative phosphoproteomics to obtain the first high
      resolution snapshot of the range of tyrosine phosphorylation events that occur in
      the cell immediately after specific c-Src stimulation. After enrichment by
      anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, we identified 29 potential novel c-Src substrate
      proteins. Tyrosine phosphopeptide mapping allowed the identification of 382
      nonredundant tyrosine phosphopeptides on 213 phosphoproteins. Stable isotope
      labeling of amino acids in cell culture-based quantitation allowed the detection 
      of 97 nonredundant tyrosine phosphopeptides whose level of phosphorylation is
      increased by c-Src. A large number of previously uncharacterized c-Src putative
      protein targets and phosphorylation sites are presented here, a majority of which
      play key roles in signaling and cytoskeletal networks, particularly in cell
      adhesion. Integrin signaling and focal adhesion kinase signaling pathway are two 
      of the most altered pathways upon c-Src activation through chemical rescue. In
      this context, our study revealed the temporal connection between c-Src activation
      and the GTPase Rap1, known to stimulate integrin-dependent adhesion. Chemical
      rescue of c-Src provided a tool to dissect the spatiotemporal mechanism of
      activation of the Rap1 guanine exchange factor, C3G, one of the identified
      potential c-Src substrates that plays a role in focal adhesion signaling. In
      addition to unveiling the role of c-Src in the cell and, specifically, in the
      Crk-C3G-Rap1 pathway, these results exemplify a strategy for obtaining a
      comprehensive understanding of the functions of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases with
      high specificity and kinetic resolution.

TI  - A Network-based Approach for Predicting Missing Pathway Interactions.
LID - e1002640
AB  - Embedded within large-scale protein interaction networks are signaling pathways
      that encode response cascades in the cell. Unfortunately, even for well-studied
      species like S. cerevisiae, only a fraction of all true protein interactions are 
      known, which makes it difficult to reason about the exact flow of signals and the
      corresponding causal relations in the network. To help address this problem, we
      introduce a framework for predicting new interactions that aid connectivity
      between upstream proteins (sources) and downstream transcription factors
      (targets) of a particular pathway. Our algorithms attempt to globally minimize
      the distance between sources and targets by finding a small set of shortcut edges
      to add to the network. Unlike existing algorithms for predicting general protein 
      interactions, by focusing on proteins involved in specific responses our approach
      homes-in on pathway-consistent interactions. We applied our method to extend
      pathways in osmotic stress response in yeast and identified several missing
      interactions, some of which are supported by published reports. We also performed
      experiments that support a novel interaction not previously reported. Our
      framework is general and may be applicable to edge prediction problems in other
      domains.

TI  - Aberrant STAT5 and PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling occurs in human CRLF2-rearranged
      B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - 833-42
AB  - Adults and children with high-risk CRLF2-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
      (ALL) respond poorly to current cytotoxic chemotherapy and suffer unacceptably
      high rates of relapse, supporting the need to use alternative therapies. CRLF2
      encodes the thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) receptor, which activates cell
      signaling in normal lymphocytes on binding its ligand, TSLP. We hypothesized that
      aberrant cell signaling occurs in CRLF2-rearranged ALL and can be targeted by
      signal transduction inhibitors of this pathway. In a large number of primary
      CRLF2-rearranged ALL samples, we observed increased basal levels of pJAK2,
      pSTAT5, and pS6. We thus characterized the biochemical sequelae of CRLF2 and JAK 
      alterations in CRLF2-rearranged ALL primary patient samples via analysis of
      TSLP-mediated signal transduction. TSLP stimulation of these leukemias further
      induced robust JAK/STAT and PI3K/mTOR pathway signaling. JAK inhibition abrogated
      phosphorylation of JAK/STAT and, surprisingly, of PI3K/mTOR pathway members,
      suggesting an interconnection between these signaling networks and providing a
      rationale for testing JAK inhibitors in clinical trials. The PI3K/mTOR pathway
      inhibitors rapamycin, PI103, and PP242 also inhibited activated signal
      transduction and translational machinery proteins of the PI3K/mTOR pathway,
      suggesting that signal transduction inhibitors targeting this pathway also may
      have therapeutic relevance for patients with CRLF2-rearranged ALL and merit
      further preclinical testing.

TI  - Identification and Validation of Inhibitor-Responsive Kinase Substrates using a
      New Paradigm to Measure Kinase-Specific Protein Phosphorylation Index.
PG  - 3637-49
AB  - Regulation of all cellular processes requires dynamic regulation of protein
      phosphorylation. We have developed an unbiased system to globally quantify the
      phosphorylation index for substrates of a specific kinase by independently
      quantifying phosphorylated and total substrate molecules in a reverse in-gel
      kinase assay. Non-phosphorylated substrate molecules are first quantified in the 
      presence and absence of a specific stimulus. Total substrate molecules are then
      measured after complete chemical de-phosphorylation, and a ratio of
      phosphorylated to total substrate is derived. To demonstrate the utility of this 
      approach, we profiled and quantified changes in phosphorylation index for Protein
      Kinase CK2 substrates that respond to a small-molecule inhibitor. A broad range
      of inhibitor-induced changes in phosphorylation was observed in cultured cells.
      Differences among substrates in the kinetics of phosphorylation change were also 
      revealed. Comparison of CK2 inhibitor-induced changes in phosphorylation in
      cultured cells and in mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes in vivo revealed
      distinct kinetic and depth-of-response profiles. This technology provides a new
      approach to facilitate functional analyses of kinase-specific phosphorylation
      events. This strategy can be used to dissect the role of phosphorylation in
      cellular events, to facilitate kinase inhibitor target validation studies, and to
      inform in vivo analyses of kinase inhibitor drug efficacy.

PG  - 300-10
AB  - The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (the MAPK/ERK kinases; MKKs or MEKs)
      and their downstream substrates, the extracellular-regulated kinases have been
      intensively studied for their roles in development and disease. Until recently,
      it had been assumed any mutation affecting their function would have lethal
      consequences. However, the identification of MEK1 and MEK2 mutations in
      developmental syndromes as well as chemotherapy-resistant tumors, and the
      discovery of genomic variants in MEK1 and MEK2 have led to the realization the
      extent of genomic variation associated with MEKs is much greater than had been
      appreciated. In this review, we will discuss these recent advances, relating them
      to what is currently understood about the structure and function of MEKs, and
      describe how they change our understanding of the role of MEKs in development and
      disease.

TI  - The Tlo Proteins Are Stoichiometric Components of Candida albicans Mediator
      Anchored via the Med3 Subunit.
PG  - 874-84
AB  - The amplification of the TLO (for telomere-associated) genes in Candida albicans,
      compared to its less pathogenic, close relative Candida dubliniensis, suggests a 
      role in virulence. Little, however, is known about the function of the Tlo
      proteins. We have purified the Mediator coactivator complex from C. albicans
      (caMediator) and found that Tlo proteins are a stoichiometric component of
      caMediator. Many members of the Tlo family are expressed, and each is a unique
      member of caMediator. Protein expression analysis of individual Tlo proteins, as 
      well as the purification of tagged Tlo proteins, demonstrate that there is a
      large free population of Tlo proteins in addition to the Mediator-associated
      population. Coexpression and copurification of Tloα12 and caMed3 in Escherichia
      coli established a direct physical interaction between the two proteins. We have 
      also made a C. albicansmed3Δ/Δ strain and purified an intact Mediator from this
      strain. The analysis of the composition of the med3Δ Mediator shows that it lacks
      a Tlo subunit. Regarding Mediator function, the med3Δ/Δ strain serves as a
      substitute for the difficult-to-make tloΔ/Δ C. albicans strain. A potential role 
      of the TLO and MED3 genes in virulence is supported by the inability of the
      med3Δ/Δ strain to form normal germ tubes. This study of caMediator structure
      provides initial clues to the mechanism of action of the Tlo genes and a platform
      for further mechanistic studies of caMediator's involvement in gene regulatory
      patterns that underlie pathogenesis.

TI  - Peginesatide and Erythropoietin Stimulate Similar Erythropoietin
      Receptor-Mediated Signal Transduction and Gene Induction Events.
PG  - 575-87
AB  - Peginesatide is a synthetic, PEGylated, peptide-based erythropoiesis-stimulating 
      agent that is designed and engineered to stimulate specifically the
      erythropoietin receptor dimer that governs erythropoiesis. Peginesatide has a
      unique structure that consists of a synthetic peptide dimer (with no sequence
      similarity to erythropoietin) conjugated to a 40 kDa PEG moiety. Peginesatide is 
      being developed for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney
      disease in dialysis patients. To compare signaling effects of peginesatide to
      recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), dose-dependent effects on protein
      phosphorylation and gene expression were evaluated using phosphoproteomics,
      quantitative signal transduction analyses and gene profiling. Following
      stimulation with peginesatide or rHuEPO, cell lysates were prepared from UT-7/EPO
      cells. LC-MS/MS and MesoScale arrays were used to quantify phosphorylation
      events. Transcriptional changes were analyzed using microarrays and quantitative 
      RT-PCR. Peginesatide and rHuEPO were found to regulate the tyrosine
      phosphorylation of an essentially equivalent set of protein substrates, and
      modulate the expression of a similar set of target genes. Consistent with their
      roles in stimulating erythropoiesis, peginesatide and rHuEPO regulate similar
      cellular pathways.

TI  - Opportunities and Challenges for Nutritional Proteomics in Cancer Prevention12.
PG  - 1360S-9S
AB  - Knowledge gaps persist about the efficacy of cancer prevention strategies based
      on dietary food components. Adaptations to nutrient supply are executed through
      tuning of multiple protein networks that include transcription factors, histones,
      modifying enzymes, translation factors, membrane and nuclear receptors, and
      secreted proteins. However, the simultaneous quantitative and qualitative
      measurement of all proteins that regulate cancer processes is not practical using
      traditional protein methodologies. Proteomics offers an attractive opportunity to
      fill this knowledge gap and unravel the effects of dietary components on protein 
      networks that impinge on cancer. The articles presented in this supplement are
      from talks proffered in the “Nutrition Proteomics and Cancer Prevention” session 
      at the American Institute for Cancer Research Annual Research Conference on Food,
      Nutrition, Physical Activity and Cancer held in Washington, DC on October 21 and 
      22, 2010. Recent advances in MS technologies suggest that studies in nutrition
      and cancer prevention may benefit from the adoption of proteomic tools to
      elucidate the impact on biological processes that govern the transition from
      normal to malignant phenotype; to identify protein changes that determine both
      positive and negative responses to food components; to assess how protein
      networks mediate dose-, time-, and tissue-dependent responses to food components;
      and, finally, for predicting responders and nonresponders. However, both the
      limited accessibility to proteomic technologies and research funding appear to be
      hampering the routine adoption of proteomic tools in nutrition and cancer
      prevention research.

TI  - Evolution of signal multiplexing by 14-3-3-binding 2R-ohnologue protein families 
      in the vertebrates.
LID - 120103
AB  - 14-3-3 proteins regulate cellular responses to stimuli by docking onto pairs of
      phosphorylated residues on target proteins. The present study shows that the
      human 14-3-3-binding phosphoproteome is highly enriched in 2R-ohnologues, which
      are proteins in families of two to four members that were generated by two rounds
      of whole genome duplication at the origin of the vertebrates. We identify
      2R-ohnologue families whose members share a ‘lynchpin’, defined as a
      14-3-3-binding phosphosite that is conserved across members of a given family,
      and aligns with a Ser/Thr residue in pro-orthologues from the invertebrate
      chordates. For example, the human receptor expression enhancing protein (REEP)
      1–4 family has the commonest type of lynchpin motif in current datasets, with a
      phosphorylatable serine in the –2 position relative to the 14-3-3-binding
      phosphosite. In contrast, the second 14-3-3-binding sites of REEPs 1–4 differ and
      are phosphorylated by different kinases, and hence the REEPs display different
      affinities for 14-3-3 dimers. We suggest a conceptual model for intracellular
      regulation involving protein families whose evolution into signal multiplexing
      systems was facilitated by 14-3-3 dimer binding to lynchpins, which gave freedom 
      for other regulatory sites to evolve. While increased signalling complexity was
      needed for vertebrate life, these systems also generate vulnerability to genetic 
      disorders.

TI  - Global gene profiling of VCP-associated inclusion body myopathy.
PG  - 226-34
AB  - Inclusion body myopathy associated with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal 
      dementia (IBMPFD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the
      Valosin Containing Protein (VCP) gene on chromosome 9p12-13. Patients demonstrate
      limb girdle muscle weakness, which eventually progresses to involve respiratory
      muscles, and death from respiratory and cardiac failure. This is the first
      investigation to analyze key molecular mediators and signaling cascades in
      skeletal muscle causing myopathy by global gene microarray in hopes of
      understanding the dysregulated genes and molecular mechanisms underlying IBMPFD
      and the hope of finding novel therapeutic targets. We determined expression
      profiles using Human Genome Array microarray technology in Vastus lateralis
      muscles from patients and their first degree relatives. We analyzed gene
      annotations by DAVID and identified differentially dysregulated genes with roles 
      in several novel biological pathways, including regulation of actin cytoskeleton,
      ErbB signaling, cancer, in addition to regulation of autophagy, and lysosomal
      signaling, known disrupted pathways in VCP disease. In this report, we present
      data from the first global microarray analyzing IBMPFD patient muscles and
      elucidating dysregulated pathways to further understand the pathogenesis of the
      disease and discover potential therapeutics.

TI  - mTORC1 is essential for leukemia propagation but not stem cell self-renewal.
PG  - 2114-29
AB  - Although dysregulation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes leukemogenesis, how
      mTORC1 affects established leukemia is unclear. We investigated the role of
      mTORC1 in mouse hematopoiesis using a mouse model of conditional deletion of
      Raptor, an essential component of mTORC1. Raptor deficiency impaired granulocyte 
      and B cell development but did not alter survival or proliferation of
      hematopoietic progenitor cells. In a mouse model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
      Raptor deficiency significantly suppressed leukemia progression by causing
      apoptosis of differentiated, but not undifferentiated, leukemia cells. mTORC1 did
      not control cell cycle or cell growth in undifferentiated AML cells in vivo.
      Transplantation of Raptor-deficient undifferentiated AML cells in a limiting
      dilution revealed that mTORC1 is essential for leukemia initiation. Strikingly, a
      subset of AML cells with undifferentiated phenotypes survived long-term in the
      absence of mTORC1 activity. We further demonstrated that the reactivation of
      mTORC1 in those cells restored their leukemia-initiating capacity. Thus, AML
      cells lacking mTORC1 activity can self-renew as AML stem cells. Our findings
      provide mechanistic insight into how residual tumor cells circumvent anticancer
      therapies and drive tumor recurrence.

TI  - TSLP Signaling Network Revealed by SILAC-Based Phosphoproteomics*.
LID - M112.017764
AB  - Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a cytokine that plays diverse roles in the
      regulation of immune responses. TSLP requires a heterodimeric receptor complex
      consisting of IL-7 receptor α subunit and its unique TSLP receptor (gene symbol
      CRLF2) to transmit signals in cells. Abnormal TSLP signaling (e.g. overexpression
      of TSLP or its unique receptor TSLPR) contributes to the development of a number 
      of diseases including asthma and leukemia. However, a detailed understanding of
      the signaling pathways activated by TSLP remains elusive. In this study, we
      performed a global quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of the TSLP signaling
      network using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture. By
      employing titanium dioxide in addition to antiphosphotyrosine antibodies as
      enrichment methods, we identified 4164 phosphopeptides on 1670 phosphoproteins.
      Using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture-based quantitation, 
      we determined that the phosphorylation status of 226 proteins was modulated by
      TSLP stimulation. Our analysis identified activation of several members of the
      Src and Tec families of kinases including Btk, Lyn, and Tec by TSLP for the first
      time. In addition, we report TSLP-induced phosphorylation of protein phosphatases
      such as Ptpn6 (SHP-1) and Ptpn11 (Shp2), which has also not been reported
      previously. Co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that Shp2 binds to the adapter
      protein Gab2 in a TSLP-dependent manner. This is the first demonstration of an
      inducible protein complex in TSLP signaling. A kinase inhibitor screen revealed
      that pharmacological inhibition of PI-3 kinase, Jak family kinases, Src family
      kinases or Btk suppressed TSLP-dependent cellular proliferation making them
      candidate therapeutic targets in diseases resulting from aberrant TSLP signaling.
      Our study is the first phosphoproteomic analysis of the TSLP signaling pathway
      that greatly expands our understanding of TSLP signaling and provides novel
      therapeutic targets for TSLP/TSLPR-associated diseases in humans.

TI  - Research Resource: Identification of Novel Growth Hormone-Regulated
      Phosphorylation Sites by Quantitative Phosphoproteomics.
PG  - 1056-73
AB  - GH and GH receptors are expressed throughout life, and GH elicits a diverse range
      of responses, including growth and altered metabolism. It is therefore important 
      to understand the full spectrum of GH signaling pathways and cellular responses. 
      We applied mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics combined with stable isotope
      labeling with amino acids in cell culture to identify proteins rapidly
      phosphorylated in response to GH in 3T3-F442A preadipocytes. We identified 132
      phosphosites in 95 proteins that exhibited rapid (5 or 15 min) GH-dependent
      statistically significant increases in phosphorylation by more than or equal to
      50% and 96 phosphosites in 46 proteins that were down-regulated by GH by more
      than or equal to 30%. Several of the GH-stimulated phosphorylation sites were
      known (e.g. regulatory Thr/Tyr in Erks 1 and 2, Tyr in signal transducers and
      activators of transcription (Stat) 5a and 5b, Ser939 in tuberous sclerosis
      protein (TSC) 2 or tuberin). The remaining 126 GH-stimulated sites were not
      previously associated with GH. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway
      analysis of GH-stimulated sites indicated enrichment in proteins associated with 
      the insulin and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, regulation of the 
      actin cytoskeleton, and focal adhesions. Akt/protein kinase A consensus sites
      (RXRXXS/T) were the most commonly phosphorylated consensus sites. Immunoblotting 
      confirmed GH-stimulated phosphorylation of all seven novel GH-dependent sites
      tested [regulatory sites in proline-rich Akt substrate, 40 kDA (PRAS40),
      regulatory associated protein of mTOR, ATP-citrate lyase, Na+/H+ exchanger-1,
      N-myc downstream regulated gene 1, and Shc]). The immunoblot results suggest that
      many, if not most, of the GH-stimulated phosphosites identified in this
      large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics analysis, including sites in multiple 
      proteins in the Akt/ mTOR complex 1 pathway, are phosphorylated in response to
      GH. Their identification significantly broadens our thinking of GH-regulated cell
      functions.

TI  - Single-step inline hydroxyapatite enrichment facilitates identification and
      quantitation of phosphopeptides from mass-limited proteomes with MudPIT.
PG  - 2697-709
AB  - Herein we report the characterization and optimization of single-step inline
      enrichment of phosphopeptides directly from small amounts of whole cell and
      tissue lysates (100 – 500 μg) using a hydroxyapatite (HAP) microcolumn and
      Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT). In comparison to a
      triplicate HILIC-IMAC phosphopeptide enrichment study, ~80% of the
      phosphopeptides identified using HAP-MudPIT were unique. Similarly, analysis of
      the consensus phosphorylation motifs between the two enrichment methods
      illustrates the complementarity of calcium-and iron-based enrichment methods and 
      the higher sensitivity and selectivity of HAP-MudPIT for acidic motifs. We
      demonstrate how the identification of more multiply phosphorylated peptides from 
      HAP-MudPIT can be used to quantify phosphorylation cooperativity. Through
      optimization of HAP-MudPIT on a whole cell lysate we routinely achieved
      identification and quantification of ca. 1000 phosphopeptides from a ~1 hr
      enrichment and 12 hr MudPIT analysis on small quantities of material. Finally, we
      applied this optimized method to identify phosphorylation sites from a
      mass-limited mouse brain region, the amygdala (200 – 500 μg), identifying up to
      4000 phosphopeptides per run.

TI  - The role of targeted chemical proteomics in pharmacology.
PG  - 457-75
AB  - Traditionally, proteomics is the high-throughput characterization of the global
      complement of proteins in a biological system using cutting-edge technologies
      (robotics and mass spectrometry) and bioinformatics tools (Internet-based search 
      engines and databases). As the field of proteomics has matured, a diverse range
      of strategies have evolved to answer specific problems. Chemical proteomics is
      one such direction that provides the means to enrich and detect less abundant
      proteins (the ‘hidden’ proteome) from complex mixtures of wide dynamic range (the
      ‘deep’ proteome). In pharmacology, chemical proteomics has been utilized to
      determine the specificity of drugs and their analogues, for anticipated known
      targets, only to discover other proteins that bind and could account for side
      effects observed in preclinical and clinical trials. As a consequence, chemical
      proteomics provides a valuable accessory in refinement of second- and
      third-generation drug design for treatment of many diseases. However, determining
      definitive affinity capture of proteins by a drug immobilized on soft gel
      chromatography matrices has highlighted some of the challenges that remain to be 
      addressed. Examples of the different strategies that have emerged using
      well-established drugs against pharmaceutically important enzymes, such as
      protein kinases, metalloproteases, PDEs, cytochrome P450s, etc., indicate the
      potential opportunity to employ chemical proteomics as an early-stage screening
      approach in the identification of new targets.

TI  - The SUMO E3-ligase PIAS1 regulates the tumor suppressor PML and its oncogenic
      counterpart PML-RARA.
PG  - 2275-84
AB  - The ubiquitin-like SUMO proteins covalently modify protein substrates and
      regulate their functional properties. In a broad spectrum of cancers, the tumor
      suppressor PML undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation primed by CK2
      phosphorylation. Here we report that the SUMO E3-ligase inhibitor PIAS1 regulates
      oncogenic signaling through its ability to sumoylate PML and the PML-RARA
      oncoprotein of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). PIAS1-mediated SUMOylation of 
      PML promoted CK2 interaction and ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation of
      PML, attenuating its tumor suppressor functions. In addition, PIAS1-mediated
      SUMOylation of PML-RARA was essential for induction of its degradation by arsenic
      trioxide, an effective APL treatment. Moreover, PIAS1 suppression abrogated the
      ability of arsenic trioxide to trigger apoptosis in APL cells. Lastly, PIAS1 was 
      also essential for PML degradation in non-small cell lung cancer cells, and PML
      and PIAS1 were inversely correlated in NSCLC cell lines and primary specimens.
      Together, our findings reveal novel roles for PIAS1 and the SUMOylation machinery
      in regulating oncogenic networks and the response to leukemia therapy.

TI  - Structure, Regulation, Signaling, and Targeting of Abl Kinases in Cancer.
PG  - 436-46
AB  - Abl kinases are prototypic cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and are involved in a
      variety of chromosomal aberrations in different cancers. This causes the
      expression of Abl fusion proteins, such as Bcr-Abl, that are constitutively
      activated and drivers of tumorigenesis. Over the past decades, biochemical and
      functional studies on the molecular mechanisms of Abl regulation have gone hand
      in hand with progression of our structural understanding of autoinhibited and
      active Abl conformations. In parallel, Abl oncoproteins have become prime
      molecular targets for cancer therapy, using adenosine triphosphate
      (ATP)–competitive kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib. Abl-targeting drugs serve 
      as a paradigm for our understanding of kinase inhibitor action, specificity, and 
      resistance development. In this review article, I will review the molecular
      mechanisms that are responsible for the regulation of Abl kinase activity and how
      oncogenic Abl fusions signal. Furthermore, past and ongoing efforts to target Abl
      oncoproteins using ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors, as well as future
      possibilities using combination therapy, will be discussed.

TI  - Deciphering Phosphotyrosine-Dependent Signaling Networks in Cancer by SH2
      Profiling.
PG  - 353-61
AB  - It has been a decade since the introduction of SH2 profiling, a modular
      domain-based molecular diagnostics tool. This review covers the original concept 
      of SH2 profiling, different analytical platforms, and their applications, from
      the detailed analysis of single proteins to broad screening in translational
      research. Illustrated by practical examples, we discuss the uniqueness and
      advantages of the approach as well as its limitations and challenges. We provide 
      guidance for basic researchers and oncologists who may consider SH2 profiling in 
      their respective cancer research, especially for those focusing on tyrosine
      phosphoproteomics. SH2 profiling can serve as an alternative phosphoproteomics
      tool to dissect aberrant tyrosine kinase pathways responsible for individual
      malignancies, with the goal of facilitating personalized diagnostics for the
      treatment of cancer.

TI  - Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Bmi1 modulates its oncogenic potential, E3 ligase
      activity, and DNA damage repair activity in mouse prostate cancer.
PG  - 1920-32
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is a major lethal malignancy in men, but the molecular
      events and their interplay underlying prostate carcinogenesis remain poorly
      understood. Epigenetic events and the upregulation of polycomb group silencing
      proteins including Bmi1 have been described to occur during PCa progression.
      Here, we found that conditional overexpression of Bmi1 in mice induced prostatic 
      intraepithelial neoplasia, and elicited invasive adenocarcinoma when combined
      with PTEN haploinsufficiency. In addition, Bmi1 and the PI3K/Akt pathway were
      coactivated in a substantial fraction of human high-grade tumors. We found that
      Akt mediated Bmi1 phosphorylation, enhancing its oncogenic potential in an
      Ink4a/Arf-independent manner. This process also modulated the DNA damage response
      and affected genomic stability. Together, our findings demonstrate the
      etiological role of Bmi1 in PCa, unravel an oncogenic collaboration between Bmi1 
      and the PI3K/Akt pathway, and provide mechanistic insights into the modulation of
      Bmi1 function by phosphorylation during prostate carcinogenesis.

TI  - Quantitative Proteomic profiling identifies protein correlates to EGFR kinase
      inhibition.
PG  - 1071-81
AB  - Clinical oncology is hampered by a lack of tools to accurately assess a patient’s
      response to pathway-targeted therapies. Serum and tumor cell surface proteins
      whose abundance, or change in abundance in response to therapy, differentiates
      patients responding to a therapy from patients not-responding to a therapy could 
      be usefully incorporated into tools for monitoring response. Here we posit and
      then verify that proteomic discovery in in vitro tissue culture models can
      identify proteins with concordant in vivo behavior and further, can be a valuable
      approach for identifying tumor-derived serum proteins. In this study we use
      Stable Isotope Labeling of Amino acids in Culture (SILAC) with proteomic
      technologies to quantitatively analyze the gefitinib-related protein changes in a
      model system for sensitivity to EGFR targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We
      identified 3,707 intracellular proteins, 1,276 cell surface proteins, and 879
      shed proteins. More than 75% of the proteins identified had quantitative
      information and a subset consisting of [400] proteins showed a statistically
      significant change in abundance following gefitinib treatment. We validated the
      change in expression profile in vitro and screened our panel of response markers 
      in an in vivo isogenic resistant model and demonstrated that these were markers
      of gefitinib response and not simply markers of phospho-EGFR downregulation. In
      doing so, we also were able to identify which proteins might be useful as markers
      for monitoring response and which proteins might be useful as markers for a
      priori prediction of response.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Analysis Reveals a Role for Serine and Threonine
      Kinases in the Cytoskeletal Reorganization in Early T Cell Receptor Activation in
      Human Primary T Cells*.
PG  - 171-86
AB  - Protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events play a primary role in
      regulation of almost all aspects of cell function including signal transduction, 
      cell cycle, or apoptosis. Thus far, T cell phosphoproteomics have focused on
      analysis of phosphotyrosine residues, and little is known about the role of
      serine/threonine phosphorylation in early activation of the T cell receptor
      (TCR). Therefore, we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based analysis of
      the global phosphoproteome of human primary T cells in response to 5 min of TCR
      activation with anti-CD3 antibody. Combining immunoprecipitation with an
      antiphosphotyrosine antibody, titanium dioxide phosphopeptide enrichment,
      isobaric tag for the relative and absolute quantitation methodology, and strong
      cation exchange separation, we were able to identify 2814 phosphopeptides. These 
      unique sites were employed to investigate the site-specific phosphorylation
      dynamics. Five hundred and seventeen phosphorylation sites showed TCR-responsive 
      changes. We found that upon 5 min of stimulation of the TCR, specific serine and 
      threonine kinase motifs are overrepresented in the set of responsive
      phosphorylation sites. These phosphorylation events targeted proteins with many
      different activities and are present in different subcellular locations. Many of 
      these proteins are involved in intracellular signaling cascades related mainly to
      cytoskeletal reorganization and regulation of small GTPase-mediated signal
      transduction, probably involved in the formation of the immune synapse.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteome Profiling of Iron-Deficient Arabidopsis
      Roots1[C][W].
PG  - 403-17
AB  - Iron (Fe) is an essential mineral nutrient for plants, but often it is not
      available in sufficient quantities to sustain optimal growth. To gain insights
      into adaptive processes to low Fe availability at the posttranslational level, we
      conducted a quantitative analysis of Fe deficiency-induced changes in the
      phosphoproteome profile of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots. Isobaric
      tags for relative and absolute quantitation-labeled phosphopeptides were analyzed
      by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry on an LTQ-Orbitrap with
      collision-induced dissociation and high-energy collision dissociation
      capabilities. Using a combination of titanium dioxide and immobilized metal
      affinity chromatography to enrich phosphopeptides, we extracted 849 uniquely
      identified phosphopeptides corresponding to 425 proteins and identified several
      not previously described phosphorylation motifs. A subset of 45 phosphoproteins
      was defined as being significantly changed in abundance upon Fe deficiency.
      Kinase motifs in Fe-responsive proteins matched to protein kinase A/calcium
      calmodulin-dependent kinase II, casein kinase II, and proline-directed kinase,
      indicating a possible critical function of these kinase classes in Fe
      homeostasis. To validate our analysis, we conducted site-directed mutagenesis on 
      IAA-CONJUGATE-RESISTANT4 (IAR4), a protein putatively functioning in auxin
      homeostasis. iar4 mutants showed compromised root hair formation and developed
      shorter primary roots. Changing serine-296 in IAR4 to alanine resulted in a
      phenotype intermediate between mutant and wild type, whereas acidic substitution 
      to aspartate to mimic phosphorylation was either lethal or caused an extreme
      dwarf phenotype, supporting the critical importance of this residue in Fe
      homeostasis. Our analyses further disclose substantial changes in the abundance
      of phosphoproteins involved in primary carbohydrate metabolism upon Fe
      deficiency, complementing the picture derived from previous proteomic and
      transcriptomic profiling studies.

TI  - High-throughput analysis of peptide binding modules.
PG  - 1527-46
AB  - Modular protein interaction domains that recognize linear peptide motifs are
      found in hundreds of proteins within the human genome. Some protein interaction
      domains such as SH2, 14-3-3, Chromo and Bromo domains serve to recognize
      post-translational modification of amino acids (such as phosphorylation,
      acetylation, methylation etc.) and translate these into discrete cellular
      responses. Other modules such as SH3 and PDZ domains recognize linear peptide
      epitopes and serve to organize protein complexes based on localization and
      regions of elevated concentration. In both cases, the ability to nucleate
      specific signaling complexes is in large part dependent on the selectivity of a
      given protein module for its cognate peptide ligand. High throughput analysis of 
      peptide-binding domains by peptide or protein arrays, phage display, mass
      spectrometry or other HTP techniques provides new insight into the potential
      protein-protein interactions prescribed by individual or even whole families of
      modules. Systems level analyses have also promoted a deeper understanding of the 
      underlying principles that govern selective protein-protein interactions and how 
      selectivity evolves. Lastly, there is a growing appreciation for the limitations 
      and potential pitfalls of high-throughput analysis of protein-peptide
      interactomes. This review will examine some of the common approaches utilized for
      large-scale studies of protein interaction domains and suggest a set of standards
      for the analysis and validation of datasets from large-scale studies of
      peptide-binding modules. We will also highlight how data from large-scale studies
      of modular interaction domain families can provide insight into systems level
      properties such as the linguistics of selective interactions.

TI  - Dynamic Reprogramming of the Kinome In Response to Targeted MEK Inhibition In
      Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
PG  - 307-21
AB  - Kinase inhibitors have limited success in cancer treatment because tumors
      circumvent their action. Using a quantitative proteomics approach, we assessed
      kinome activity in response to MEK inhibition in triple negative breast cancer
      (TNBC) cells and genetically engineered mice (GEMMs). MEK inhibition caused acute
      ERK activity loss, resulting in rapid c-Myc degradation that induced expression
      and activation of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RNAi knockdown of ERK
      or c-Myc mimicked RTK induction by MEK inhibitors, whereas prevention of
      proteasomal c-Myc degradation blocked kinome reprogramming. MEK inhibitor-induced
      RTK stimulation overcame MEK2 but not MEK1 inhibition, reactivating ERK and
      producing drug resistance. The C3Tag GEMM for TNBC similarly induced RTKs in
      response to MEK inhibition. The inhibitor-induced RTK profile suggested a kinase 
      inhibitor combination therapy that produced GEMM tumor apoptosis and regression
      where single agents were ineffective. This approach defines mechanisms of drug
      resistance, allowing rational design of combination therapies for cancer.

      CO-RECEPTOR LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR-RELATED PROTEIN-5 (LRP5)*.
PG  - 12016-26
AB  - Background: Wnt signaling blocks adipocyte development and is implicated in
      diabetes and the metabolic syndrome.Results: Wnt stimulates insulin mediators via
      an insulin/IGF-1 receptor-dependent process; conversely, Wnt co-receptor LRP5 is 
      essential to normal insulin signaling in preadipocytes.Conclusion: Insulin and
      Wnt signaling pathways interact and are both dependent on LRP5.Significance:
      Altered Wnt/LRP5 activity can play a role in obesity and insulin resistance.

TI  - c-Src and c-Abl kinases control hierarchic phosphorylation and function of the
      CagA effector protein in Western and East Asian Helicobacter pylori strains .
PG  - 1553-66
AB  - Many bacterial pathogens inject into host cells effector proteins that are
      substrates for host tyrosine kinases such as Src and Abl family kinases.
      Phosphorylated effectors eventually subvert host cell signaling, aiding disease
      development. In the case of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori, which is a 
      major risk factor for the development of gastric cancer, the only known effector 
      protein injected into host cells is the oncoprotein CagA. Here, we followed the
      hierarchic tyrosine phosphorylation of H. pylori CagA as a model system to study 
      early effector phosphorylation processes. Translocated CagA is phosphorylated on 
      Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motifs EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and EPIYA-C in Western
      strains of H. pylori and EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, and EPIYA-D in East Asian strains. We 
      found that c-Src only phosphorylated EPIYA-C and EPIYA-D, whereas c-Abl
      phosphorylated EPIYA-A, EPIYA-B, EPIYA-C, and EPIYA-D. Further analysis revealed 
      that CagA molecules were phosphorylated on 1 or 2 EPIYA motifs, but never
      simultaneously on 3 motifs. Furthermore, none of the phosphorylated EPIYA motifs 
      alone was sufficient for inducing AGS cell scattering and elongation. The
      preferred combination of phosphorylated EPIYA motifs in Western strains was
      EPIYA-A and EPIYA-C, either across 2 CagA molecules or simultaneously on 1. Our
      study thus identifies a tightly regulated hierarchic phosphorylation model for
      CagA starting at EPIYA-C/D, followed by phosphorylation of EPIYA-A or EPIYA-B.
      These results provide insight for clinical H. pylori typing and clarify the role 
      of phosphorylated bacterial effector proteins in pathogenesis.

TI  - Regulation of mitochondrial respiration and apoptosis through cell signaling:
      cytochrome c oxidase and cytochrome c in ischemia/reperfusion injury and
      inflammation.
PG  - 598-609
AB  - Cytochrome c (Cytc) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) catalyze the terminal reaction
      of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), the reduction of oxygen to
      water. This irreversible step is highly regulated, as indicated by the presence
      of tissue-specific and developmentally expressed isoforms, allosteric regulation,
      and reversible phosphorylations, which are found in both Cytc and COX. The
      crucial role of the ETC in health and disease is obvious since it, together with 
      ATP synthase, provides the vast majority of cellular energy, which drives all
      cellular processes. However, under conditions of stress, the ETC generates
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause cell damage and trigger death
      processes. We here discuss current knowledge of the regulation of Cytc and COX
      with a focus on cell signaling pathways, including cAMP/protein kinase A and
      tyrosine kinase signaling. Based on the crystal structures we highlight all
      identified phosphorylation sites on Cytc and COX, and we present a new
      phosphorylation site, Ser126 on COX subunit II. We conclude with a model that
      links cell signaling with the phosphorylation state of Cytc and COX. This in turn
      regulates their enzymatic activities, the mitochondrial membrane potential, and
      the production of ATP and ROS. Our model is discussed through two distinct human 
      pathologies, acute inflammation as seen in sepsis, where phosphorylation leads to
      strong COX inhibition followed by energy depletion, and ischemia/reperfusion
      injury, where hyperactive ETC complexes generate pathologically high
      mitochondrial membrane potentials, leading to excessive ROS production. Although 
      operating at opposite poles of the ETC activity spectrum, both conditions can
      lead to cell death through energy deprivation or ROS-triggered apoptosis.

TI  - Host gene targets for novel influenza therapies elucidated by high-throughput RNA
      interference screens.
PG  - 1372-86
AB  - Influenza virus encodes only 11 viral proteins but replicates in a broad range of
      avian and mammalian species by exploiting host cell functions. Genome-wide RNA
      interference (RNAi) has proven to be a powerful tool for identifying the host
      molecules that participate in each step of virus replication. Meta-analysis of
      findings from genome-wide RNAi screens has shown influenza virus to be dependent 
      on functional nodes in host cell pathways, requiring a wide variety of molecules 
      and cellular proteins for replication. Because rapid evolution of the influenza A
      viruses persistently complicates the effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics, 
      a further understanding of the complex host cell pathways coopted by influenza
      virus for replication may provide new targets and strategies for antiviral
      therapy. RNAi genome screening technologies together with bioinformatics can
      provide the ability to rapidly identify specific host factors involved in
      resistance and susceptibility to influenza virus, allowing for novel disease
      intervention strategies.—Meliopoulos, V. A., Andersen, L. E., Birrer, K. F.,

TI  - Identification of genes required for Cf-dependent hypersensitive cell death by
      combined proteomic and RNA interfering analyses.
PG  - 2421-35
AB  - Identification of hypersensitive cell death (HCD) regulators is essential to
      dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying plant disease resistance. In this
      study, combined proteomic and RNA interfering (RNAi) analyses were employed to
      identify genes required for the HCD conferred by the tomato resistance gene Cf-4 
      and the Cladosporium fulvum avirulence gene Avr4. Forty-nine proteins
      differentially expressed in the tomato seedlings mounting and those not mounting 
      Cf-4/Avr4-dependent HCD were identified through proteomic analysis. Among them
      were a variety of defence-related proteins including a cysteine protease, Pip1,
      an operative target of another C. fulvum effector, Avr2. Additionally,
      glutathione-mediated antioxidation is a major response to Cf-4/Avr4-dependent
      HCD. Functional analysis through tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing and 
      transient RNAi assays of the chosen 16 differentially expressed proteins revealed
      that seven genes, which encode Pip1 homologue NbPip1, a SIPK type MAP kinase
      Nbf4, an asparagine synthetase NbAsn, a trypsin inhibitor LeMir-like protein
      NbMir, a small GTP-binding protein, a late embryogenesis-like protein, and an
      ASR4-like protein, were required for Cf-4/Avr4-dependent HCD. Furthermore, the
      former four genes were essential for Cf-9/Avr9-dependent HCD; NbPip1, NbAsn, and 
      NbMir, but not Nbf4, affected a nonadaptive bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae
      pv. oryzae-induced HCD in Nicotiana benthamiana. These data demonstrate that Pip1
      and LeMir may play a general role in HCD and plant immunity and that the
      application of combined proteomic and RNA interfering analyses is an efficient
      strategy to identify genes required for HCD, disease resistance, and probably
      other biological processes in plants.

TI  - Proteome Dataset of Human Gingival Crevicular Fluid from Healthy Periodontium
      Sites by Multi-Dimensional Protein Separation and Mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 248-62
AB  - Background and Objective: Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) has been of major
      interest for many decades as valuable body fluid that may serve as a source of
      biomarkers for both periodontal and systemic diseases. Because of its very small 
      sample size, sub-μl level, identification of its protein composition by classical
      biochemical methods has been limited. The advent of highly sensitive mass
      spectrometric technology has permitted large-scale identification of protein
      components of many biological samples. This technology has been employed to
      identify protein composition of GCF from inflamed and periodontal sites. In this 
      report we present a proteome dataset of GCF from healthy periodontium sites.
      Methods: A combination of periopaper collection method with application of
      multidimensional protein separation and mass spectrometric (MS) technology led to
      a large-scale documentation of the proteome of GCF from healthy periodontium
      sites. Results: The approaches utilized have culminated in identification of 199 
      proteins in GCF of periodontally healthy sites. The current GCF proteome from
      healthy sites was compared and contrasted with those proteomes of GCF from
      inflamed and periodontal sites as well as serum. The cross-correlation of the GCF
      and plasma proteomes permitted dissociation of the 199 identified GCF proteins
      into, 105 proteins (57%) that can be identified in plasma and 94 proteins (43%)
      which are distinct and unique to GCF microenvironment. Such analysis also
      revealed distinctions in protein functional categories between serum proteins and
      those specific to GCF microenvironment. Conclusion: Firstly, the data presented
      herein provide the proteome of GCF from periodontally healthy sites through
      establishment of innovative analytical approaches for effective analysis of GCF
      from periopapers both at the level of complete elusion and removal of abundant
      albumin which restricts identification of low abundant proteins. Secondly, it
      adds significantly to the knowledge of GCF composition and highlights new groups 
      of proteins specific to GCF microenvironment.

TI  - PHOSPHOPROTEOMIC STUDIES OF RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASES: FUTURE PERSPECTIVES.
PG  - 1100-7
AB  - In the last decade, large-scale mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomic studies 
      of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have generated a compendium of signalling
      networks that are activated downstream of these receptors. In this article, a
      brief summary of previous phosphoproteomic studies on Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor (EGFR) signalling will be presented together with a perspective on the
      importance for the field to keep pace with new advances in RTK biology. Using
      examples drawn primarily from studies on the EGFR, c-Met and Flt3 receptors,
      areas in RTK biology which will greatly benefit from the power of
      phosphoproteomics will be discussed, including a. validating oncogenic RTK
      mutants identified in cancer genome sequencing efforts, b. spatial RTK signalling
      networks and c. understanding crosstalk and co-activation between members of the 
      RTK superfamily.

TI  - Chemical genetic identification of NDR1/2 kinase substrates AAK1 and Rabin8
      uncovers their roles in controlling dendrite arborization and spine development.
PG  - 1127-42
AB  - Dendrite arborization and synapse formation are essential for wiring the neural
      circuitry. The evolutionarily conserved NDR1/2 kinase pathway, important for
      polarized growth from yeast to mammals, controls dendrite growth and morphology
      in worm and fly. Whether NDR1/2 kinases regulate dendrite and synapse development
      in mammals was not known. Nor have their phosphorylation targets been identified.
      Here we show that expression of dominant negative (kinase dead) NDR1/2 mutants or
      siRNA increase dendrite length and proximal branching of mammalian pyramidal
      neurons in cultures and in vivo, whereas expression of constitutively active
      NDR1/2 has the opposite effects. Moreover, NDR1/2 contributes to dendritic spine 
      development and excitatory synaptic function. We further employed chemical
      genetics and identified NDR1/2 substrates in the brain, including two proteins
      involved in intracellular vesicle trafficking: AAK1 (AP-2 associated kinase) and 
      Rabin8, a GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) of Rab8 GTPase. We finally show that AAK1
      contributes to dendrite growth regulation and Rabin8 regulates spine development.

TI  - The Yeast Nuclear Pore Complex and Transport Through It.
PG  - 855-83
AB  - Exchange of macromolecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm is a key regulatory 
      event in the expression of a cell’s genome. This exchange requires a dedicated
      transport system: (1) nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), embedded in the nuclear
      envelope and composed of proteins termed nucleoporins (or “Nups”), and (2)
      nuclear transport factors that recognize the cargoes to be transported and ferry 
      them across the NPCs. This transport is regulated at multiple levels, and the NPC
      itself also plays a key regulatory role in gene expression by influencing nuclear
      architecture and acting as a point of control for various nuclear processes. Here
      we summarize how the yeast Saccharomyces has been used extensively as a model
      system to understand the fundamental and highly conserved features of this
      transport system, revealing the structure and function of the NPC; the NPC’s role
      in the regulation of gene expression; and the interactions of transport factors
      with their cargoes, regulatory factors, and specific nucleoporins.

TI  - Identification of Autophagosome-associated Proteins and Regulators by
      Quantitative Proteomic Analysis and Genetic Screens*.
LID - M111.014035
AB  - Autophagy is one of the major intracellular catabolic pathways, but little is
      known about the composition of autophagosomes. To study the associated proteins, 
      we isolated autophagosomes from human breast cancer cells using two different
      biochemical methods and three stimulus types: amino acid deprivation or rapamycin
      or concanamycin A treatment. The autophagosome-associated proteins were dependent
      on stimulus, but a core set of proteins was stimulus-independent. Remarkably,
      proteasomal proteins were abundant among the stimulus-independent common
      autophagosome-associated proteins, and the activation of autophagy significantly 
      decreased the cellular proteasome level and activity supporting interplay between
      the two degradation pathways. A screen of yeast strains defective in the
      orthologs of the human genes encoding for a common set of
      autophagosome-associated proteins revealed several regulators of autophagy,
      including subunits of the retromer complex. The combined spatiotemporal proteomic
      and genetic data sets presented here provide a basis for further characterization
      of autophagosome biogenesis and cargo selection.

TI  - Regulation of Protein Kinase D1 Activity.
PG  - 284-91
AB  - Protein kinase D1 (PKD1) is a stress-activated serine/threonine kinase that plays
      a vital role in various physiologically important biological processes, including
      cell growth, apoptosis, adhesion, motility, and angiogenesis. Dysregulated PKD1
      expression also contributes to the pathogenesis of certain cancers and
      cardiovascular disorders. Studies to date have focused primarily on the canonical
      membrane-delimited pathway for PKD1 activation by G protein-coupled receptors or 
      peptide growth factors. Here, agonist-dependent increases in diacylglycerol
      accumulation lead to the activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC-dependent
      phosphorylation of PKD1 at two highly conserved serine residues in the activation
      loop; this modification increases PKD1 catalytic activity, as assessed by PKD1
      autophosphorylation at a consensus phosphorylation motif at the extreme C
      terminus. However, recent studies expose additional controls and consequences for
      PKD1 activation loop and C-terminal phosphorylation as well as additional
      autophosphorylation reactions and trans-phosphorylations (by PKC and other
      cellular enzymes) that contribute to the spatiotemporal control of PKD1 signaling
      in cells. This review focuses on the multisite phosphorylations that are known or
      predicted to influence PKD1 catalytic activity and may also influence docking
      interactions with cellular scaffolds and trafficking to signaling microdomains in
      various subcellular compartments. These modifications represent novel targets for
      the development of PKD1-directed pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancers and
      cardiovascular disorders.

TI  - STK33 kinase inhibitor BRD-8899 has no effect on KRAS-dependent cancer cell
      viability.
PG  - 2860-5
AB  - Approximately 30% of human cancers harbor oncogenic gain-of-function mutations in
      KRAS. Despite interest in KRAS as a therapeutic target, direct blockade of KRAS
      function with small molecules has yet to be demonstrated. Based on experiments
      that lower mRNA levels of protein kinases, KRAS-dependent cancer cells were
      proposed to have a unique requirement for the serine/threonine kinase STK33.
      Thus, it was suggested that small-molecule inhibitors of STK33 might have
      therapeutic benefit in these cancers. Here, we describe the development of
      selective, low nanomolar inhibitors of STK33’s kinase activity. The most potent
      and selective of these, BRD8899, failed to kill KRAS-dependent cells. While
      several explanations for this result exist, our data are most consistent with the
      view that inhibition of STK33’s kinase activity does not represent a promising
      anti-KRAS therapeutic strategy.

TI  - 15N labeled brain enables quantification of proteome and phosphoproteome in
      cultured primary neurons.
PG  - 1341-53
AB  - Terminally differentiated primary cells represent a valuable in vitro model to
      study signaling events associated within a specific tissue. Quantitative
      proteomic methods using metabolic labeling in primary cells encounter labeling
      efficiency issues hindering the use of these cells. Here we developed a method to
      quantify the proteome and phosphoproteome of cultured neurons using 15N labeled
      brain tissue as an internal standard, and applied this method to determine how an
      inhibitor of an excitatory neural transmitter receptor, phencyclidine (PCP),
      affects the global phosphoproteome of cortical neurons. We identified over 10,000
      phosphopeptides and made accurate quantitative measurements of the neuronal
      phosphoproteome after neuronal inhibition. We show that short PCP treatments lead
      to changes in phosphorylation for 7% of neuronal phosphopeptides and that
      prolonged PCP treatment alters the total levels of several proteins essential for
      synaptic transmission and plasticity and leads to a massive reduction in the
      synaptic strength of inhibitory synapses. The results provide valuable insights
      into the dynamics of molecular networks implicated in PCP-mediated NMDA receptor 
      inhibition and sensorimotor deficits.

TI  - Erythrocyte plasma membrane–bound ERK1/2 activation promotes ICAM-4–mediated
      sickle red cell adhesion to endothelium.
PG  - 1217-27
AB  - The core pathology of sickle cell disease (SCD) starts with the erythrocyte
      (RBC). Aberration in MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling, which can regulate cell adhesion,
      occurs in diverse pathologies. Because RBCs contain abundant ERK1/2, we predicted
      that ERK1/2 is functional in sickle (SS) RBCs and promotes adherence, a hallmark 
      of SCD. ERK1/2 remained active in SS but not normal RBCs. β2-adrenergic receptor 
      stimulation by epinephrine can enhance ERK1/2 activity only in SS RBCs via PKA-
      and tyrosine kinase p72syk-dependent pathways. ERK signaling is implicated in RBC
      ICAM-4 phosphorylation, promoting SS RBC adhesion to the endothelium. SS RBC
      adhesion and phosphorylation of both ERK and ICAM-4 all decreased with continued 
      cell exposure to epinephrine, implying that activation of ICAM-4–mediated SS RBC 
      adhesion is temporally associated with ERK1/2 activation. Furthermore,
      recombinant ERK2 phosphorylated α- and β-adducins and dematin at the ERK
      consensus motif. Cytoskeletal protein 4.1 also showed dynamic phosphorylation but
      not at the ERK consensus motif. These results demonstrate that ERK activation
      induces phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins and the adhesion molecule
      ICAM-4, promoting SS RBC adhesion to the endothelium. Thus, blocking RBC ERK1/2
      activation, such as that promoted by catecholamine stress hormones, could
      ameliorate SCD pathophysiology.

TI  - The SRC-associated protein CUB Domain-Containing Protein-1 regulates adhesion and
      motility.
PG  - 653-63
AB  - Multiple SRC-family kinases (SFKs) are commonly activated in carcinoma and appear
      to have a role in metastasis through incompletely understood mechanisms. Recent
      studies have shown that CDCP1 (CUB (complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1)
      Domain-Containing Protein-1) is a transmembrane protein and an SRC substrate
      potentially involved in metastasis. Here we show that increased SFK and CDCP1
      tyrosine phosphorylation is, surprisingly, associated with a decrease in FAK
      phosphorylation. This appears to be true in human tumors as shown by our
      correlation analysis of a mass spectrometric data set of affinity-purified
      phosphotyrosine peptides obtained from normal and cancer lung tissue samples.
      Induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of CDCP1 in cell culture, including by a
      mAb that binds to its extracellular domain, promoted changes in SFK and FAK
      tyrosine phosphorylation, as well as in PKC™, a protein known to associate with
      CDCP1, and these changes are accompanied by increases in adhesion and motility.
      Thus, signaling events that accompany the CDCP1 tyrosine phosphorylation observed
      in cell lines and human lung tumors may explain how the CDCP1/SFK complex
      regulates motility and adhesion.

TI  - The multifunctional poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) 1 is subject to extensive
      dynamic post-translational modification, which molecular modelling suggests plays
      an important role in co-ordinating its activities.
PG  - 803-12
AB  - PABP1 [poly(A)-binding protein 1] is a central regulator of mRNA translation and 
      stability and is required for miRNA (microRNA)-mediated regulation and
      nonsense-mediated decay. Numerous protein, as well as RNA, interactions underlie 
      its multi-functional nature; however, it is unclear how its different activities 
      are co-ordinated, since many partners interact via overlapping binding sites. In 
      the present study, we show that human PABP1 is subject to elaborate
      post-translational modification, identifying 14 modifications located throughout 
      the functional domains, all but one of which are conserved in mouse.
      Intriguingly, PABP1 contains glutamate and aspartate methylations, modifications 
      of unknown function in eukaryotes, as well as lysine and arginine methylations,
      and lysine acetylations. The latter dramatically alter the pI of PABP1, an effect
      also observed during the cell cycle, suggesting that different biological
      processes/stimuli can regulate its modification status, although PABP1 also
      probably exists in differentially modified subpopulations within cells. Two
      lysine residues were differentially acetylated or methylated, revealing that
      PABP1 may be the first example of a cytoplasmic protein utilizing a
      ‘methylation/acetylation switch’. Modelling using available structures implicates
      these modifications in regulating interactions with individual PAM2
      (PABP-interacting motif 2)-containing proteins, suggesting a direct link between 
      PABP1 modification status and the formation of distinct mRNP (messenger
      ribonucleoprotein) complexes that regulate mRNA fate in the cytoplasm.

TI  - An adult passive transfer mouse model to study desmoglein 3 signaling in
      pemphigus vulgaris.
PG  - 346-55
AB  - Evidence has accumulated that changes in intracellular signaling downstream of
      desmoglein 3 (Dsg3) may play a significant role in epithelial blistering in the
      autoimmune disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV). Currently, most studies on PV involve
      passive transfer of pathogenic antibodies into neonatal mice which have not
      finalized epidermal morphogenesis, and do not permit analysis of mature hair
      follicles (HFs) and stem cell niches. To investigate Dsg3 antibody-induced
      signaling in the adult epidermis at defined stages of the HF cycle, we here
      developed a model with passive transfer of the monospecific pathogenic Dsg3
      antibody AK23 into adult 8-week-old C57Bl/6J mice. Validated using
      histopathological and molecular methods, we found that this model faithfully
      recapitulates major features described in PV patients and PV models. Two hours
      after AK23 transfer we observed widening of intercellular spaces between
      desmosomes and EGFR activation, followed by increased Myc expression and
      epidermal hyperproliferation, desmosomal Dsg3 depletion and predominant
      blistering in HFs and oral mucosa. These data confirm that the adult passive
      transfer mouse model is ideally suited for detailed studies of Dsg3
      antibody-mediated signaling in adult skin, providing the basis for investigations
      on novel keratinocyte-specific therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Protein Expression Signatures for Inhibition of Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor-mediated Signaling*.
LID - M111.015222
AB  - Analysis of cellular signaling networks typically involves targeted measurements 
      of phosphorylated protein intermediates. However, phosphoproteomic analyses
      usually require affinity enrichment of phosphopeptides and can be complicated by 
      artifactual changes in phosphorylation caused by uncontrolled preanalytical
      variables, particularly in the analysis of tissue specimens. We asked whether
      changes in protein expression, which are more stable and easily analyzed, could
      reflect network stimulation and inhibition. We employed this approach to analyze 
      stimulation and inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by EGF 
      and selective EGFR inhibitors. Shotgun analysis of proteomes from proliferating
      A431 cells, EGF-stimulated cells, and cells co-treated with the EGFR inhibitors
      cetuximab or gefitinib identified groups of differentially expressed proteins.
      Comparisons of these protein groups identified 13 proteins whose EGF-induced
      expression changes were reversed by both EGFR inhibitors. Targeted multiple
      reaction monitoring analysis verified differential expression of 12 of these
      proteins, which comprise a candidate EGFR inhibition signature. We then tested
      these 12 proteins by multiple reaction monitoring analysis in three other models:
      1) a comparison of DiFi (EGFR inhibitor-sensitive) and HCT116 (EGFR-insensitive) 
      cell lines, 2) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse xenograft DiFi and
      HCT116 tumors, and 3) in tissue biopsies from a patient with the gastric
      hyperproliferative disorder Ménétrier's disease who was treated with cetuximab.
      Of the proteins in the candidate signature, a core group, including c-Jun,
      Jagged-1, and Claudin 4, were decreased by EGFR inhibitors in all three models.
      Although the goal of these studies was not to validate a clinically useful EGFR
      inhibition signature, the results confirm the hypothesis that clinically used
      EGFR inhibitors generate characteristic protein expression changes. This work
      further outlines a prototypical approach to derive and test protein expression
      signatures for drug action on signaling networks.

TI  - Dynamics of the G Protein-coupled Vasopressin V2 Receptor Signaling Network
      Revealed by Quantitative Phosphoproteomics*.
LID - M111.014613
AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) regulate diverse physiological processes, and
      many human diseases are due to defects in GPCR signaling. To identify the dynamic
      response of a signaling network downstream from a prototypical Gs-coupled GPCR,
      the vasopressin V2 receptor, we have carried out multireplicate, quantitative
      phosphoproteomics with iTRAQ labeling at four time points following vasopressin
      exposure at a physiological concentration in cells isolated from rat kidney. A
      total of 12,167 phosphopeptides were identified from 2,783 proteins, with 273
      changing significantly in abundance with vasopressin. Two-dimensional clustering 
      of phosphopeptide time courses and Gene Ontology terms revealed that ligand
      binding to the V2 receptor affects more than simply the canonical cyclic
      adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A and arrestin pathways under
      physiological conditions. The regulated proteins included key components of actin
      cytoskeleton remodeling, cell-cell adhesion, mitogen-activated protein kinase
      signaling, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and apoptosis pathways. These data suggest
      that vasopressin can regulate an array of cellular functions well beyond its
      classical role in regulating water and solute transport. These results greatly
      expand the current view of GPCR signaling in a physiological context and shed new
      light on potential roles for this signaling network in disorders such as
      polycystic kidney disease. Finally, we provide an online resource of
      physiologically regulated phosphorylation sites with dynamic quantitative data
      (http://helixweb.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/TiPD/index.html).

TI  - Positive Selection for New Disease Mutations in the Human Germline: Evidence from
      the Heritable Cancer Syndrome Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2B.
LID - e1002420
AB  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B) is a highly aggressive thyroid
      cancer syndrome. Since almost all sporadic cases are caused by the same
      nucleotide substitution in the RET proto-oncogene, the calculated disease
      incidence is 100–200 times greater than would be expected based on the genome
      average mutation frequency. In order to determine whether this increased
      incidence is due to an elevated mutation rate at this position (true mutation hot
      spot) or a selective advantage conferred on mutated spermatogonial stem cells, we
      studied the spatial distribution of the mutation in 14 human testes. In donors
      aged 36–68, mutations were clustered with small regions of each testis having
      mutation frequencies several orders of magnitude greater than the rest of the
      testis. In donors aged 19–23 mutations were almost non-existent, demonstrating
      that clusters in middle-aged donors grew during adulthood. Computational analysis
      showed that germline selection is the only plausible explanation. Testes of men
      aged 75–80 were heterogeneous with some like middle-aged and others like younger 
      testes. Incorporating data on age-dependent death of spermatogonial stem cells
      explains the results from all age groups. Germline selection also explains
      MEN2B's male mutation bias and paternal age effect. Our discovery focuses
      attention on MEN2B as a model for understanding the genetic and biochemical basis
      of germline selection. Since RET function in mouse spermatogonial stem cells has 
      been extensively studied, we are able to suggest that the MEN2B mutation provides
      a selective advantage by altering the PI3K/AKT and SFK signaling pathways.
      Mutations that are preferred in the germline but reduce the fitness of offspring 
      increase the population's mutational load. Our approach is useful for studying
      other disease mutations with similar characteristics and could uncover additional
      germline selection pathways or identify true mutation hot spots.

TI  - Oncogene-specific activation of tyrosine kinase networks during prostate cancer
      progression.
PG  - 1643-8
AB  - Dominant mutations or DNA amplification of tyrosine kinases are rare among the
      oncogenic alterations implicated in prostate cancer. We demonstrate that
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in men exhibits increased tyrosine
      phosphorylation, raising the question of whether enhanced tyrosine kinase
      activity is observed in prostate cancer in the absence of specific tyrosine
      kinase mutation or DNA amplification. We generated a mouse model of prostate
      cancer progression using commonly perturbed non-tyrosine kinase oncogenes and
      pathways and detected a significant up-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation at 
      the carcinoma stage. Phosphotyrosine peptide enrichment and quantitative mass
      spectrometry identified oncogene-specific tyrosine kinase signatures, including
      activation of EGFR, ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EPHA2), and JAK2. Kinase:substrate 
      relationship analysis of the phosphopeptides also revealed ABL1 and SRC tyrosine 
      kinase activation. The observation of elevated tyrosine kinase signaling in
      advanced prostate cancer and identification of specific tyrosine kinase pathways 
      from genetically defined tumor models point to unique therapeutic approaches
      using tyrosine kinase inhibitors for advanced prostate cancer.

TI  - Proteomics in the characterization of adipose dysfunction in obesity.
PG  - 25-37
AB  - Adipose tissue plays a central role in body weight homeostasis, inflammation, and
      insulin resistance via serving as a fat-buffering system, regulating lipid
      storage and mobilization and releasing a large range of adipokines and cytokines.
      Adipose tissue is also the major inflammation-initiated site in obesity.
      Adipose-derived adipokines and cytokines are known to be involved in the
      modulation of a wide range of important physiological processes, particularly
      immune response, glucose and lipid homeostasis and insulin resistance. Adipose
      tissue dysfunction, characterized by an imbalanced secretion of pro- and
      anti-inflammatory adipokines and cytokines, decreased insulin-stimulated glucose 
      uptake, dysregulation of lipid storage and release and mitochondrial dysfunction,
      has been linked to obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. Proteomic
      technology has been a powerful tool for identifying key components of the adipose
      proteome, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of adipose tissue dysfunction 
      in obesity. In this review, we summarized the recent advances in the proteomic
      characterization of adipose tissue and discussed the identified proteins that
      potentially play important roles in insulin resistance and lipid homeostasis.

TI  - Chapter X. Phosphorylation of mammalian cytochrome c and cytochrome c oxidase in 
      the regulation of cell destiny: respiration, apoptosis, and human disease.
PG  - 237-64
AB  - The mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) system generates the vast
      majority of cellular energy, but is also involved in the generation of reactive
      oxygen species (ROS), and apoptosis. Cytochrome c (Cytc) and cytochrome c oxidase
      (COX) represent the terminal step of the electron transport chain (ETC), the
      proposed rate-limiting reaction in mammals. Cytc and COX show unique regulatory
      features including allosteric regulation, isoform expression, and regulation
      through cell signaling pathways. This chapter focuses on the latter and discusses
      all mapped phosphorylation sites based on the crystal structures of COX and Cytc.
      Several signaling pathways have been identified that target COX including protein
      kinase A and C, receptor tyrosine kinase, and inflammatory signaling. In
      addition, four phosphorylation sites have been mapped on Cytc with potentially
      large implications due to its multiple functions including apoptosis, a pathway
      that is overactive in stressed cells but inactive in cancer. The role of COX and 
      Cytc phosphorylation is reviewed in a human disease context, including cancer,
      inflammation, sepsis, asthma, and ischemia/reperfusion injury as seen in
      myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.

TI  - Will Kinase Inhibitors Make it as Glioblastoma Drugs?
PG  - 135-69
AB  - Kinase inhibitors have emerged as effective cancer therapeutics in a variety of
      human cancers. Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor in
      adults, represents a compelling disease for kinase inhibitor therapy because the 
      majority of these tumors harbor genetic alterations that result in aberrant
      activation of growth factor signaling pathways. Attempts to target the
      Ras—Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)—mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)
      axis in GBM with first generation receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors and
      rapalogs have been disappointing. However, there is reason for renewed optimism
      given the now very detailed knowledge of the cancer genome in GBM and a wealth of
      novel compounds entering the clinic, including next generation RTK inhibitors,
      class I PI3K inhibitors, mTOR kinase inhibitors (TORKinibs), and dual PI3(K)/mTOR
      inhibitors. This chapter reviews common genetic alterations in growth factor
      signaling pathways in GBM, their validation as therapeutic targets in this
      disease, and strategies for future clinical development of kinase inhibitors for 
      high grade glioma.

TI  - MicroRNAs: molecular features and role in cancer.
PG  - 2508-40
AB  - microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding endogenously produced RNAs that play key
      roles in controlling the expression of many cellular proteins. Once they are
      recruited and incorporated into a ribonucleoprotein complex miRISC, they can
      target specific mRNAs in a miRNA sequence-dependent process and interfere in the 
      translation into proteins of the targeted mRNAs via several mechanisms.
      Consequently, miRNAs can regulate many cellular pathways and processes.
      Dysregulation of their physiological roles may largely contribute to disease. In 
      particular, in cancer, miRNAs can be involved in the deregulation of the
      expression of important genes that play key roles in tumorigenesis, tumor
      development, and angiogenesis and have oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles. This 
      review focuses on the biogenesis and maturation of miRNAs, their mechanisms of
      gene regulation, and the way their expression is deregulated in cancer. The
      involvement of miRNAs in several oncogenic pathways such as angiogenesis and
      apoptosis, and in the inter-cellular dialog mediated by miRNA-loaded exosomes as 
      well as the development of new therapeutical strategies based on miRNAs will be
      discussed.

TI  - Exosome mimetics: a novel class of drug delivery systems.
PG  - 1525-41
AB  - The identification of extracellular phospholipid vesicles as conveyors of
      cellular information has created excitement in the field of drug delivery.
      Biological therapeutics, including short interfering RNA and recombinant
      proteins, are prone to degradation, have limited ability to cross biological
      membranes, and may elicit immune responses. Therefore, delivery systems for such 
      drugs are under intensive investigation. Exploiting extracellular vesicles as
      carriers for biological therapeutics is a promising strategy to overcome these
      issues and to achieve efficient delivery to the cytosol of target cells. Exosomes
      are a well studied class of extracellular vesicles known to carry proteins and
      nucleic acids, making them especially suitable for such strategies. However, the 
      considerable complexity and the related high chance of off-target effects of
      these carriers are major barriers for translation to the clinic. Given that it is
      well possible that not all components of exosomes are required for their proper
      functioning, an alternative strategy would be to mimic these vesicles
      synthetically. By assembly of liposomes harboring only crucial components of
      natural exosomes, functional exosome mimetics may be created. The low complexity 
      and use of well characterized components strongly increase the pharmaceutical
      acceptability of such systems. However, exosomal components that would be
      required for the assembly of functional exosome mimetics remain to be identified.
      This review provides insights into the composition and functional properties of
      exosomes, and focuses on components which could be used to enhance the drug
      delivery properties of exosome mimetics.

TI  - Characterization of the Phosphoproteome in Human Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid.
LID - 460261
AB  - Global-scale examination of protein phosphorylation in human biological fluids by
      phosphoproteomics approaches is an emerging area of research with potential for
      significant contributions towards discovery of novel biomarkers. In this pilot
      work, we analyzed the phosphoproteome in human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL)
      from nondiseased subjects. The main objectives were to assess the feasibility to 
      probe phosphorylated proteins in human BAL and to obtain the initial catalog of
      BAL phosphoproteins, including protein identities and exact description of their 
      phosphorylation sites. We used a gel-free bioanalytical workflow that included
      whole-proteome digestion of depleted BAL proteins, enrichment of phosphopeptides 
      by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), LC-MS/MS analyses with a
      linear ion trap mass spectrometer, and searches of a protein sequence database to
      generate a panel of BAL phosphoproteins and their sites of phosphorylation. Based
      on sequence-diagnostic MS/MS fragmentation patterns, we identified a collection
      of 36 phosphopeptides that contained 26 different phosphorylation sites. These
      phosphopeptides mapped to 21 phosphoproteins including, for example, vimentin,
      plastin-2, ferritin heavy chain, kininogen-1, and others. The characterized
      phosphoproteins have diverse characteristics in terms of cellular origin and
      biological function. To the best of our knowledge, results of this study
      represent the first description of the human BAL phosphoproteome.

TI  - Interactome of the Plant-specific ESCRT-III Component AtVPS2.2 in Arabidopsis
      thaliana.
PG  - 397-411
AB  - The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) guides
      transmembrane proteins to domains that bud away from the cytoplasm. The ESCRT
      machinery consists of four complexes. ESCRT complexes 0–II are important for
      cargo recognition and concentration via ubiquitin binding. Most of the membrane
      bending function is mediated by the large multimeric ESCRT-III complex and
      associated proteins. Here we present the first in vivo proteome analysis of a
      member of the ESCRT-III complex which is unique to the plant kingdom. We show
      with LC–MS/MS, yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence
      complementation (BiFC) that coimmunoprecipitated proteins from
      Arabidopsisthaliana roots expressing a functional GFP-tagged VACUOLAR PROTEIN
      SORTING 2.2 (AtVPS2.2) protein are members of the ESCRT-III complex and
      associated proteins. Therefore we propose that at least in plants the large
      ESCRT-III membrane scaffolding complex consists of a mixture of SNF7, VPS2 and
      the associated VPS46 and VPS60 proteins. Apart from transmembrane proteins,
      numerous membrane-associated but also nuclear and extracellular proteins have
      been identified, indicating that AtVPS2.2 might be involved in processes beyond
      the classical ESCRT role. This study is the first in vivo proteome analysis with 
      a tagged ESCRT-III component demonstrating the feasibility of this approach and
      provides numerous starting points for the investigation of the biological process
      in which AtVPS2.2 is involved.

TI  - Nuclear Transport: A Switch for the Oxidative Stress—Signaling Circuit?
LID - 208650
AB  - Imbalances in the formation and clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can
      lead to oxidative stress and subsequent changes that affect all aspects of
      physiology. To limit and repair the damage generated by ROS, cells have developed
      a multitude of responses. A hallmark of these responses is the activation of
      signaling pathways that modulate the function of downstream targets in different 
      cellular locations. To this end, critical steps of the stress response that occur
      in the nucleus and cytoplasm have to be coordinated, which makes the proper
      communication between both compartments mandatory. Here, we discuss the
      interdependence of ROS-mediated signaling and the transport of macromolecules
      across the nuclear envelope. We highlight examples of oxidant-dependent nuclear
      trafficking and describe the impact of oxidative stress on the transport
      apparatus. Our paper concludes by proposing a cellular circuit of ROS-induced
      signaling, nuclear transport and repair.

TI  - Cell Stress Proteins in Atherothrombosis.
LID - 232464
AB  - Cell stress proteins (CSPs) are a large and heterogenous family of proteins,
      sharing two main characteristics: their levels and/or location are modified under
      stress and most of them can exert a chaperon function inside the cells.
      Nonetheless, they are also involved in the modulation of several mechanisms, both
      at the intracellular and the extracellular compartments. There are more than 100 
      proteins belonging to the CSPs family, among them the thioredoxin (TRX) system,
      which is the focus of the present paper. TRX system is composed of several
      proteins such as TRX and peroxiredoxin (PRDX), two thiol-containing enzymes that 
      are key players in redox homeostasis due to their ability to scavenge potential
      harmful reactive oxygen species. In addition to their main role as antioxidants, 
      recent data highlights their function in several processes such as cell
      signalling, immune inflammatory responses, or apoptosis, all of them key
      mechanisms involved in atherothrombosis. Moreover, since TRX and PRDX are present
      in the pathological vascular wall and can be secreted under prooxidative
      conditions to the circulation, several studies have addressed their role as
      diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases
      (CVDs).

TI  - Protein-intrinsic and signaling network-based sources of resistance to EGFR- and 
      ErbB family-targeted therapies in head and neck cancer.
PG  - 260-79
AB  - Agents targeting EGFR and related ErbB family proteins are valuable therapies for
      the treatment of many cancers. For some tumor types, including squamous cell
      carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN), antibodies targeting EGFR were the first
      protein-directed agents to show clinical benefit, and remain a standard component
      of clinical strategies for management of the disease. Nevertheless, many patients
      display either intrinsic or acquired resistance to these drugs; hence, major
      research goals are to better understand the underlying causes of resistance, and 
      to develop new therapeutic strategies that boost the impact of EGFR/ErbB
      inhibitors. In this review, we first summarize current standard use of EGFR
      inhibitors in the context of SCCHN, and described new agents targeting EGFR
      currently moving through pre-clinical and clinical development. We then discuss
      how changes in other transmembrane receptors, including IGF1R, c-Met, and TGF-β, 
      can confer resistance to EGFR-targeted inhibitors, and discuss new agents
      targeting these proteins. Moving downstream, we discuss critical EGFR-dependent
      effectors, including PLC-γ; PI3K and PTEN; SHC, GRB2, and RAS and the STAT
      proteins, as factors in resistance to EGFR-directed inhibitors and as alternative
      targets of therapeutic inhibition. We summarize alternative sources of resistance
      among cellular changes that target EGFR itself, through regulation of ligand

AB  - TOR (Target Of Rapamycin) is a highly conserved protein kinase that is important 
      in both fundamental and clinical biology. In fundamental biology, TOR is a
      nutrient-sensitive, central controller of cell growth and aging. In clinical
      biology, TOR is implicated in many diseases and is the target of the drug
      rapamycin used in three different therapeutic areas. The yeast Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae has played a prominent role in both the discovery of TOR and the
      elucidation of its function. Here we review the TOR signaling network in S.
      cerevisiae.

TI  - Uncovering the Proteome Response of the Master Circadian Clock to Light Using an 
      AutoProteome System*.
LID - M110.007252
AB  - In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the central circadian pacemaker 
      that governs rhythmic fluctuations in behavior and physiology in a 24-hr cycle
      and synchronizes them to the external environment by daily resetting in response 
      to light. The bilateral SCN is comprised of a mere ∼20,000 neurons serving as
      cellular oscillators, a fact that has, until now, hindered the systematic study
      of the SCN on a global proteome level. Here we developed a fully automated and
      integrated proteomics platform, termed AutoProteome system, for an in-depth
      analysis of the light-responsive proteome of the murine SCN. All requisite steps 
      for a large-scale proteomic study, including preconcentration, buffer exchanging,
      reduction, alkylation, digestion and online two-dimensional liquid
      chromatography-tandem MS analysis, are performed automatically on a standard
      liquid chromatography-MS system. As low as 2 ng of model protein bovine serum
      albumin and up to 20 μg and 200 μg of SCN proteins can be readily processed and
      analyzed by this system. From the SCN tissue of a single mouse, we were able to
      confidently identify 2131 proteins, of which 387 were light-regulated based on a 
      spectral counts quantification approach. Bioinformatics analysis of the
      light-inducible proteins reveals their diverse distribution in different
      canonical pathways and their heavy connection in 19 protein interaction networks.
      The AutoProteome system identified vasopressin-neurophysin 2-copeptin and casein 
      kinase 1 delta, both of which had been previously implicated in clock timing
      processes, as light-inducible proteins in the SCN. Ras-specific guanine
      nucleotide-releasing factor 1, ubiquitin protein ligase E3A, and X-linked
      ubiquitin specific protease 9, none of which had previously been implicated in
      SCN clock timing processes, were also identified in this study as light-inducible
      proteins. The AutoProteome system opens a new avenue to systematically explore
      the proteome-wide events that occur in the SCN, either in response to light or
      other stimuli, or as a consequence of its intrinsic pacemaker capacity.

PG  - 3435-40
AB  - Phosphorylation of proteins is an important mechanism used to regulate most
      cellular processes. Recently, we completed an extensive phosphoproteomic analysis
      of the core proteins that constitute the Saccharomyces cerevisiae centrosome.
      Here, we present a study of phosphorylation sites found on the mitotic exit
      network (MEN) proteins, most of which are associated with the cytoplasmic face of
      the centrosome. We identified 55 sites on Bfa1, Cdc5, Cdc14 and Cdc15. Eight
      sites lie in cyclin-dependent kinase motifs (Cdk, S/T-P), and 22 sites are
      completely conserved within fungi. More than half of the sites were found in
      centrosomes from mitotic cells, possibly in preparation for their roles in
      mitotic exit. Finally, we report phosphorylation site information for other
      important cell cycle and regulatory proteins.

TI  - Mammalian Pragmin regulates Src family kinases via the Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala
      (EPIYA) motif that is exploited by bacterial effectors.
PG  - 14938-43
AB  - Several pathogenic bacteria have adopted effector proteins that, upon delivery
      into mammalian cells, undergo tyrosine phosphorylation at the Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala
      (EPIYA) or EPIYA-like sequence motif by host kinases such as Src family kinases
      (SFKs). This EPIYA phosphorylation triggers complex formation of bacterial
      effectors with SH2 domain-containing proteins that results in perturbation of
      host cell signaling and subsequent pathogenesis. Although the presence of such an
      anomalous protein interaction suggests the existence of a mammalian
      EPIYA-containing protein whose function is mimicked or subverted by bacterial
      EPIYA effectors, no molecule that uses the EPIYA motif for biological function
      has so far been reported in mammals. Here we show that mammalian Pragmin/SgK223
      undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the EPIYA motif by SFKs and thereby
      acquires the ability to interact with the SH2 domain of the C-terminal Src kinase
      (Csk), a negative regulator of SFKs. The Pragmin–Csk interaction prevents
      translocalization of Csk from the cytoplasm to the membrane and subsequent
      inactivation of membrane-associated SFKs. As a result, SFK activity is sustained 
      in cells where Pragmin is phosphorylated at the EPIYA motif. Because EPIYA
      phosphorylation of Pragmin is mediated by SFKs, cytoplasmic sequestration of Csk 
      by Pragmin establishes a positive feedback regulation of SFK activation.
      Remarkably, the Helicobacter pylori EPIYA effector CagA binds to the Csk SH2
      domain in place of Pragmin and enforces membrane recruitment of Csk and
      subsequent inhibition of SFKs. This work identifies Pragmin as a mammalian EPIYA 
      effector and suggests that bacterial EPIYA effectors target Pragmin to subvert
      SFKs for successful infection.

TI  - Angiotensin II type 1 receptor signalling regulates microRNA differentially in
      cardiac fibroblasts and myocytes.
PG  - 394-404
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) is a key
      regulator of blood pressure and cardiac contractility and is profoundly involved 
      in development of cardiac disease. Since several microRNAs (miRNAs) have been
      implicated in cardiac disease, we determined whether miRNAs might be regulated by
      AT1R signals in a Gαq/11-dependent or -independent manner. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH:
      We performed a global miRNA array analysis of angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated
      miRNA regulation in HEK293N cells overexpressing the AT1R and focused on
      separating the role of Gαq/11-dependent and -independent pathways. MiRNA
      regulation was verified with quantitative PCR in both HEK293N cells and primary
      cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts. KEY RESULTS: Our studies revealed five miRNAs
      (miR-29b, -129-3p, -132, -132* and -212) that were up-regulated by Ang II in
      HEK293N cells. In contrast, the biased Ang II analogue, [Sar1, Ile4, Ile8] Ang II
      (SII Ang II), which selectively activates Gαq/11-independent signalling, failed
      to regulate miRNAs in HEK293N cells. Furthermore, Ang II-induced miRNA regulation
      was blocked following Gαq/11 and Mek1 inhibition. The observed Ang II regulation 
      of miRNA was confirmed in primary cultures of adult cardiac fibroblasts.
      Interestingly, Ang II did not regulate miRNA expression in cardiac myocytes, but 
      SII Ang II significantly down-regulated miR-129-3p. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS:
      Five miRNAs were regulated by Ang II through mechanisms depending on Gαq/11 and
      Erk1/2 activation. These miRNAs may be involved in Ang II-mediated cardiac
      biology and disease, as several of these miRNAs have previously been associated
      with cardiovascular disease and were found to be regulated in cardiac cells.

TI  - Global proteomics analysis of testis and ovary in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio).
PG  - 619-47
AB  - The molecular mechanisms controlling sex determination and differentiation in
      zebrafish (Danio rerio) are largely unknown. A genome-wide analysis may provide
      comprehensive insights into the processes involved. The mRNA expression in
      zebrafish gonads has been fairly well studied, but much less data on the
      corresponding protein expression are available, although the proteins are
      considered to be more relevant markers of gene function. Because mRNA and protein
      abundances rarely correlate well, mRNA profiles need to be complemented with the 
      information on protein expression. The work presented here analyzed the proteomes
      of adult zebrafish gonads by a multidimensional protein identification
      technology, generating the to-date most populated lists of proteins expressed in 
      mature zebrafish gonads. The acquired proteomics data partially confirmed
      existing transcriptomics information for several genes, including several novel
      transcripts. However, disagreements between mRNA and protein abundances were
      often observed, further stressing the necessity to assess the expression on
      different levels before drawing conclusions on a certain gene’s expression and
      function. Several gene groups expressed in a sexually dimorphic way in zebrafish 
      gonads were identified. Their potential importance for gonad development and
      function is discussed. The data gained in the current study provide a basis for
      further work on elucidating processes occurring during zebrafish development with
      use of high-throughput proteomics.Electronic supplementary material: The online

TI  - Forced Dimerization Increases the Activity of ΔEGFR/EGFRvIII and Enhances Its
      Oncogenicity.
PG  - 1199-208
AB  - ΔEGFR, an in-frame deletion mutant of the extracellular ligand-binding domain,
      which occurs in about 30% of glioblastoma, is a potent oncogene that promotes
      tumor growth and progression. The signaling of ΔEGFR is ligand-independent and
      low intensity, allowing it to evade the normal mechanisms of internalization and 
      degradation by the endocytic machinery, and hence is persistent. The basis of the
      oncogenic potential of ΔEGFR remains incompletely understood, including whether
      dimerization plays an important role in its signal and whether its oncogenic
      potential is dependent on its relatively low intensity, when compared to the
      acutely activated wild-type receptor. To examine these two important questions we
      have generated a chimeric ΔEGFR that allows forced dimerization via domains
      derived from variants of the FKBP12 protein that are brought together by
      FK506-derivatives. Forced dimerization of chimeric ΔEGFR significantly increased 
      the intensity of its signal, as measured by receptor phosphorylation levels,
      suggesting that the naturally occurring ΔEGFR does not form strong or stable
      dimers as part of its low level signal. Interestingly the increased activity of
      dimerized, chimeric ΔEGFR did not promote receptor internalization, implying that
      ΔEGFR’s reduced rate of endocytic downregulation is an inherent characteristic.
      Significantly, forced dimerization enhanced the oncogenic signal of the receptor,
      implying that the ΔEGFR is a potent oncogene despite, not because of its low
      intensity.

TI  - Unraveling regulation and new components of human P-bodies through a protein
      interaction framework and experimental validation.
PG  - 1619-34
AB  - The cellular factors involved in mRNA degradation and translation repression can 
      aggregate into cytoplasmic domains known as GW bodies or mRNA processing bodies
      (P-bodies). However, current understanding of P-bodies, especially the regulatory
      aspect, remains relatively fragmentary. To provide a framework for studying the
      mechanisms and regulation of P-body formation, maintenance, and disassembly, we
      compiled a list of P-body proteins found in various species and further grouped
      both reported and predicted human P-body proteins according to their functions.
      By analyzing protein–protein interactions of human P-body components, we found
      that many P-body proteins form complex interaction networks with each other and
      with other cellular proteins that are not recognized as P-body components. The
      observation suggests that these other cellular proteins may play important roles 
      in regulating P-body dynamics and functions. We further used siRNA-mediated gene 
      knockdown and immunofluorescence microscopy to demonstrate the validity of our in
      silico analyses. Our combined approach identifies new P-body components and
      suggests that protein ubiquitination and protein phosphorylation involving 14-3-3
      proteins may play critical roles for post-translational modifications of P-body
      components in regulating P-body dynamics. Our analyses provide not only a global 
      view of human P-body components and their physical interactions but also a wealth
      of hypotheses to help guide future research on the regulation and function of
      human P-bodies.

TI  - Repression of KIAA1199 attenuates Wnt-signalling and decreases the proliferation 
      of colon cancer cells.
PG  - 552-61
AB  - Background:: The KIAA1199 transcript is upregulated in colon adenomas and
      downregulated upon β-catenin knockdown. Methods:: Transcript profiling was
      performed on >500 colon biopsies, methylation profiling data were compared with
      transcript data. Immunohistochemistry assessed KIAA1199 protein expression in 270
      stage II/III tumours (>3 years follow-up). The effects of stable KIAA1199
      knockdown in SW480 cells (three different constructs) were studied using
      transcriptional profiling, proliferation and protein analysis. Results:: The
      KIAA1199 transcript was strongly upregulated in 95% of adenocarcinomas. Absent
      expression in normal mucosa correlated with KIAA1199 promotor methylation.
      Nuclear and cytoplasmic KIAA1199 protein expression was identified in colon
      adenocarcinomas and other types of cancers. A subpopulation of patients with
      tumours strongly expressing KIAA1199 in the nucleus showed a better outcome with 
      regard to recurrence as lung or liver metastases. The KIAA1199 knockdown affected
      the cell cycle and the Wnt-signalling pathway. Reduced cellular proliferation and
      decreased KI67, phosphorylated retinoblastoma, β-catenin and ASCL2 protein
      expression supported these findings. Eighteen Wnt-signalling genes differentially
      expressed upon KIAA1199 knockdown correlated with the KIAA1199 expression profile
      in clinical specimens. Conclusion:: The KIAA1199 knockdown attenuates the effects
      of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling and it may thus be regarded as a regulatory part 
      of this pathway.

TI  - 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) marks
      MYC-overexpressing human basal-like breast cancers.
PG  - 5164-74
AB  - In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells avidly take up glucose and metabolize
      it to lactate even when oxygen is abundant, a phenomenon referred to as the
      Warburg effect. This fundamental alteration in glucose metabolism in cancer cells
      enables their specific detection by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) following 
      intravenous injection of the glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose (18FDG).
      However, this useful imaging technique is limited by the fact that not all
      cancers avidly take up FDG. To identify molecular determinants of
      18FDG-retention, we interogated the transcriptomes of human cancer cell lines and
      primary tumors for metabolic pathways associated with 18FDG radiotracer uptake.
      From 95 metabolic pathways that were interrogated, the glycolysis and several
      glycolysis-related pathways (pentose-phosphate, carbon fixation, aminoacyl-tRNA
      biosynthesis, one-carbon-pool by folate) showed the greatest transcriptional
      enrichment. This “FDG signature” predicted FDG-uptake in breast cancer cell lines
      and overlapped with established gene expression signatures for the “basal-like”
      breast cancer subtype and MYC-induced tumorigenesis in mice. Human breast cancers
      with nuclear MYC staining and high RNA expression of MYC target genes showed high
      18FDG-PET uptake (p < 0.005). Presence of the FDG signature was similarly
      associated with MYC gene copy gain, increased MYC transcript levels, and elevated
      expression of metabolic MYC target genes in a human breast cancer genomic
      dataset. Together, our findings link clinical observations of glucose uptake with
      a pathologic and molecular subtype of human breast cancer. Further, they suggest 
      related approaches to derive molecular determinants of radiotracer retention for 
      other PET-imaging probes.

TI  - Cytosolic p120-catenin regulates growth of metastatic lobular carcinoma through
      Rock1-mediated anoikis resistance.
PG  - 3176-88
AB  - Metastatic breast cancer is the major cause of cancer-related death among women
      in the Western world. Invasive carcinoma cells are able to counteract apoptotic
      signals in the absence of anchorage, enabling cell survival during invasion and
      dissemination. Although loss of E-cadherin is a cardinal event in the development
      and progression of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), little is known about the
      underlying mechanisms that govern these processes. Using a mouse model of human
      ILC, we show here that cytosolic p120-catenin (p120) regulates tumor growth upon 
      loss of E-cadherin through the induction of anoikis resistance. p120 conferred
      anchorage independence by indirect activation of Rho/Rock signaling through
      interaction and inhibition of myosin phosphatase Rho–interacting protein (Mrip), 
      an antagonist of Rho/Rock function. Consistent with these data, primary human ILC
      samples expressed hallmarks of active Rock signaling, and Rock controlled the
      anoikis resistance of human ILC cells. Thus, we have linked loss of E-cadherin — 
      an initiating event in ILC development — to Rho/Rock-mediated control of
      anchorage-independent survival. Because activation of Rho and Rock are strongly
      linked to cancer progression and are susceptible to pharmacological inhibition,
      these insights may have clinical implications for the development of tailor-made 
      intervention strategies to better treat invasive and metastatic lobular breast
      cancer.

TI  - Genome-wide Characterization of miR-34a Induced Changes in Protein and mRNA
      Expression by a Combined Pulsed SILAC and Microarray Analysis*.
LID - M111.010462
AB  - The gene encoding the miR-34a microRNA is a transcriptional target of the p53
      tumor suppressor protein and subject to epigenetic inactivation in colorectal
      cancer and numerous other tumor types. Here, we combined pulsed SILAC (pSILAC)
      and microarray analyses to identify miR-34a-induced changes in protein and mRNA
      expression. pSILAC allowed to quantify the de novo protein synthesis of 1206
      proteins after activation of a conditional miR-34a allele in a colorectal cancer 
      cell line. ∼19% of the detected proteins were differentially regulated, with 113 
      proteins being down- and 115 up-regulated. The proteins with a miR-34a
      seed-matching-sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the corresponding
      mRNA showed a clear bias toward translational repression. Proteins involved in
      DNA replication, e.g. the MCM proteins, and cell proliferation, were
      over-represented among indirectly down-regulated proteins lacking a miR-34a
      seed-match. The decrease in de novo protein synthesis of direct miR-34a targets
      correlated with reduced levels of the corresponding mRNA in most cases,
      indicating an interdependence of both types of regulation. In addition, 43 mRNAs 
      encoding proteins not detected by pSILAC were down-regulated after miR-34a
      expression and contained miR-34a seed-matches. The direct regulation of selected 
      miR-34a target-mRNAs was confirmed using reporter assays. Via down-regulation of 
      the proteins encoded by these mRNAs miR-34a presumably inhibits glycolysis
      (LDHA), WNT-signaling (LEF1), invasion/migration (AXL) and lipid metabolism
      (ACSL1, ACSL4). Furthermore, miR-34a may activate p53 by inhibiting its
      acetylation (MTA2, HDAC1) and degradation (YY1). In summary, miR-34a presumably
      participates in multiple tumor suppressive pathways by directly and indirectly
      suppressing the expression of numerous, critical proteins.

TI  - G protein-dependent and –independent signaling pathways and their impact on
      cardiac function.
PG  - 217-30
AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) signal through a variety of mechanisms that
      impact cardiac function, including contractility and hypertrophy. G
      protein-dependent and -independent pathways each have the capacity to initiate
      numerous intracellular signaling cascades to mediate these effects. G
      protein-dependent signaling has been studied for decades and great strides
      continue to be made in defining the intricate pathways and effectors regulated by
      G proteins and their impact on cardiac function. G protein-independent signaling 
      is a relatively newer concept that is being explored more frequently in the
      cardiovascular system. Recent studies have begun to reveal how cardiac function
      may be regulated via G protein-independent signaling, especially with respect to 
      the ever-expanding cohort of β-arrestin-mediated processes. This review primarily
      focuses on the impact of both G protein-dependent and β-arrestin-dependent
      signaling pathways on cardiac function, highlighting the most recent data that
      illustrate the comprehensive nature of these mechanisms of GPCR signaling.

AB  - Drosophila melanogaster has a long history as a model organism with several
      unique features that make it an ideal research tool for the study of the
      relationship between genotype and phenotype. Importantly fundamental genetic
      principles as well as key human disease genes have been uncovered through the use
      of Drosophila. The contribution of the fruit fly to science and medicine
      continues in the postgenomic era as cell-based Drosophila RNAi screens are a
      cost-effective and scalable enabling technology that can be used to quantify the 
      contribution of different genes to diverse cellular processes. Drosophila
      high-throughput screens can also be used as integral part of systems-level
      approaches to describe the architecture and dynamics of cellular networks.

TI  - Yeast 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent Protein Kinase-1 (PDK1) Orthologs Pkh1–3
      Differentially Regulate Phosphorylation of Protein Kinase A (PKA) and the Protein
      Kinase B (PKB)/S6K Ortholog Sch9*.
PG  - 22017-27
AB  - Pkh1, -2, and -3 are the yeast orthologs of mammalian
      3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). Although essential for
      viability, their functioning remains poorly understood. Sch9, the yeast protein
      kinase B and/or S6K ortholog, has been identified as one of their targets. We now
      have shown that in vitro interaction of Pkh1 and Sch9 depends on the hydrophobic 
      PDK1-interacting fragment pocket in Pkh1 and requires the complementary
      hydrophobic motif in Sch9. We demonstrated that Pkh1 phosphorylates Sch9 both in 
      vitro and in vivo on its PDK1 site and that this phosphorylation is essential for
      a wild type cell size. In vivo phosphorylation on this site disappeared during
      nitrogen deprivation and rapidly increased again upon nitrogen resupplementation.
      In addition, we have shown here for the first time that the PDK1 site in protein 
      kinase A is phosphorylated by Pkh1 in vitro, that this phosphorylation is
      Pkh-dependent in vivo and occurs during or shortly after synthesis of the protein
      kinase A catalytic subunits. Mutagenesis of the PDK1 site in Tpk1 abolished
      binding of the regulatory subunit and cAMP dependence. As opposed to PDK1 site
      phosphorylation of Sch9, phosphorylation of the PDK1 site in Tpk1 was not
      regulated by nitrogen availability. These results bring new insight into the
      control and prevalence of PDK1 site phosphorylation in yeast by Pkh protein
      kinases.

TI  - Identification of Kalirin-7 as a Potential Post-Synaptic Density Signaling Hub.
PG  - 2828-41
AB  - Kalirin-7 (Kal7), a multi-functional Rho GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1
      and RhoG, is embedded in the post-synaptic density at excitatory synapses, where 
      it participates in the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines. Kal7 has
      been implicated in long-term potentiation, fear memories and addiction-like
      behaviors. Using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectroscopy, we
      identified sites phosphorylated by six PSD-localized kinases implicated in
      synaptic plasticity and behavior, sites phosphorylated when myc-Kal7 was
      expressed in non-neuronal cells and sites phosphorylated in mouse brain Kal7. A
      site in the Sec14p domain phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin dependent protein 
      kinase II, protein kinase A and protein kinase C, was phosphorylated in mouse
      brain, but not in non-neuronal cells. Phosphorylation in the spectrin-like repeat
      region was more extensive in mouse brain than in non-neuronal cells, with a total
      of 20 sites identified. Sites in the pleckstrin homology domain and in the linker
      region connecting the GEF domain to the PDZ binding motif were heavily
      phosphorylated in both non-neuronal cells and in mouse brain and affected GEF
      activity. We postulate that the kinase convergence and divergence observed in
      Kal7 identify it as a key player in integration of the multiple inputs that
      regulate synaptic structure and function.

TI  - Functional Relevance of Biased Signaling at the Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor.
PG  - 99-111
AB  - Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (AT1R blockers, or ARBs) are used
      commonly in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders such as heart failure and
      hypertension. Their clinical success arises from their ability to prevent
      deleterious Gαq protein activation downstream of AT1R, which leads to a decrease 
      in morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have identified AT1R ligands that
      concurrently inhibit Gαq protein-dependent signaling and activate Gαq
      protein-independent/β-arrestin-dependent signaling downstream of AT1R, events
      that may actually improve cardiovascular performance more than conventional ARBs.
      The ability of such ligands to induce intracellular signaling events in an
      AT1R-β-arrestin-dependent manner while preventing AT1R-Gαq protein activity
      defines them as biased AT1R ligands. This mini-review will highlight recent
      studies that have defined biased signaling at the AT1R and discuss the possible
      clinical relevance of β-arrestin-biased AT1R ligands in the cardiovascular
      system.

TI  - A HIF-regulated VHL-PTP1B-Src signaling axis identifies a therapeutic target in
      Renal Cell Carcinoma.
PG  - 85ra47
AB  - Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a molecularly heterogeneous disease that
      is intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. While VEGF and mTOR 
      targeted therapies have shown clinical activity, their effects are variable and
      short-lived, underscoring the need for improved treatment strategies for RCC.
      Here, we used quantitative phosphoproteomics and immunohistochemical profiling of
      346 RCC specimens to determine that Src kinase signaling is elevated in RCC cells
      that retain wild type (WT) von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein expression.
      Correspondingly, VHL-WT RCC cell lines and xenografts were sensitized to the Src 
      inhibitor dasatinib compared to VHL null cells. Forced expression of hypoxia
      inducible factor (HIF) in VHL-WT RCC cells diminished Src signaling output by
      repressing transcription of the Src activator protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B
      (PTP1B) and conferred resistance to dasatinib. Our results suggest that a
      HIF-regulated VHL-PTP1B-Src signaling axis determines sensitivity of RCC to Src
      inhibitors and that stratification of RCC patients using antibody-based biomarker
      profiling may identify patients likely to respond to Src inhibitors in RCC
      clinical trials.

TI  - Spatial Phosphoprotein Profiling Reveals a Compartmentalized Extracellular
      Signal-regulated Kinase Switch Governing Neurite Growth and Retraction*.
PG  - 18190-201
AB  - Brain development and spinal cord regeneration require neurite sprouting and
      growth cone navigation in response to extension and collapsing factors present in
      the extracellular environment. These external guidance cues control neurite
      growth cone extension and retraction processes through intracellular protein
      phosphorylation of numerous cytoskeletal, adhesion, and polarity complex
      signaling proteins. However, the complex kinase/substrate signaling networks that
      mediate neuritogenesis have not been investigated. Here, we compare the neurite
      phosphoproteome under growth and retraction conditions using neurite purification
      methodology combined with mass spectrometry. More than 4000 non-redundant
      phosphorylation sites from 1883 proteins have been annotated and mapped to
      signaling pathways that control kinase/phosphatase networks, cytoskeleton
      remodeling, and axon/dendrite specification. Comprehensive informatics and
      functional studies revealed a compartmentalized ERK activation/deactivation
      cytoskeletal switch that governs neurite growth and retraction, respectively. Our
      findings provide the first system-wide analysis of the phosphoprotein signaling
      networks that enable neurite growth and retraction and reveal an important
      molecular switch that governs neuritogenesis.

TI  - P2X7 Receptor Antagonists Display Agonist-like Effects on Cell Signaling
      Proteins.
PG  - 532-42
AB  - Background: The activation of various P2 receptors (P2R) by extracellular
      nucleotides promotes diverse cellular events, including the stimulation of cell
      signaling protein and increases in [Ca2+]i. We report that some agents that can
      block P2X7R receptors also promote diverse P2X7R-independent effects on cell
      signaling. Methods: We exposed native rat parotid acinar cells, salivary gland
      cell lines (Par-C10, HSY, HSG), and PC12 cells to suramin, DIDS
      (4,4′-diisothiocyano stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid), Cibacron Blue 3GA, Brilliant
      Blue G, and the P2X7R-selective antagonist A438079, and examined the
      activation/phosphorylation of ERK1/2, PKCδ, Src, CDCP1, and other signaling
      proteins. Results: With the exception of suramin, these agents blocked the
      phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by BzATP in rat parotid acinar cells; but higher
      concentrations of suramin blocked ATP-stimulated 45Ca2+ entry. Aside from
      A438079, these agents increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Src, PKCδ, and
      other proteins (including Dok-1) within minutes in an agent- and cell
      type-specific manner in the absence of a P2X7R ligand. The stimulatory effect of 
      these compounds on the tyrosine phosphorylation of CDCP1 and its Src-dependent
      association with PKCδ was blocked by knockdown of CDCP1, which also blocked Src
      and PKCδ phosphorylation. Conclusions: Several agents used as P2X7R blockers
      promote the activation of various signaling proteins and thereby act more like
      receptor agonists than antagonists. General significance: Some compounds used to 
      block P2 receptors have complicated effects that may confound their use in
      blocking receptor activation and other biological processes for which they are
      employed, including their use as blockers of various ion transport proteins.

TI  - Epstein-Barr Virus LMP1 Activates EGFR, STAT3, and ERK through Effects on PKCδ▿.
PG  - 4399-408
AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that infects more than 90%
      of the world's adult population and is linked to multiple malignancies, including
      Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The EBV
      oncoprotein LMP1 induces transcription of the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR), which is expressed at high levels in NPC. EGFR transcription is induced
      by LMP1 through a p50 NFκB1-Bcl-3 complex, and Bcl-3 is induced by LMP1-mediated 
      activation of STAT3. This study reveals that LMP1, through its carboxyl-terminal 
      activation domain 1 (LMP1-CTAR1), activates both STAT3 and EGFR in a
      serum-independent manner with constitutive serine phosphorylation of STAT3. Upon 
      treatment with EGF, the LMP1-CTAR1-induced EGFR was additionally phosphorylated
      and STAT3 became phosphorylated on tyrosine, concomitant with upregulation of a
      subset of STAT3 target genes. The kinase responsible for LMP1-CTAR1-mediated
      serine phosphorylation of STAT3 was identified to be PKCδ using specific RNAi, a 
      dominant negative PKCδ, and the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin. Interestingly,
      inhibition of PKCδ also inhibited constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR and
      LMP1-CTAR1-induced phosphorylation of ERK. Inhibition of PKCδ blocked
      LMP1-CTAR1-mediated transformation of Rat-1 cells, likely through the inhibition 
      of ERK activation. These findings indicate that LMP1 activates multiple distinct 
      signaling pathways and suggest that PKCδ functions as a master regulator of EGFR,
      STAT3, and ERK activation by LMP1-CTAR1.

TI  - Targeting p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) to induce apoptosis of tumor cells.
PG  - 7177-82
AB  - p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are serine/threonine protein kinases that serve as
      important mediators of Rac and Cdc42 GTPase function as well as pathways required
      for Ras-driven tumorigenesis. PAK1 has been implicated in signaling by growth
      factor receptors and morphogenetic processes that control cell polarity,
      invasion, and actin cytoskeleton organization. To better understand the role of
      PAK1 in tumorigenesis, PAK1 genomic copy number and expression were determined
      for a large panel of breast, lung, and head and neck tumors. PAK1 genomic
      amplification at 11q13 was prevalent in luminal breast cancer, and PAK1 protein
      expression was associated with lymph node metastasis. Breast cancer cells with
      PAK1 genomic amplification rapidly underwent apoptosis after inhibition of this
      kinase. Strong nuclear and cytoplasmic PAK1 expression was also prevalent in
      squamous nonsmall cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), and selective PAK1 inhibition
      was associated with delayed cell-cycle progression in vitro and in vivo. NSCLC
      cells were profiled using a library of pathway-targeted small-molecule
      inhibitors, and several synergistic combination therapies, including combination 
      with antagonists of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, were revealed for PAK1. Dual
      inhibition of PAK1 and X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis efficiently
      increased effector caspase activation and apoptosis of NSCLC cells. Together, our
      results provide evidence for dysregulation of PAK1 in breast and squamous NSCLCs 
      and a role for PAK1 in cellular survival and proliferation in these indications.

PG  - 527-85
AB  - Systems biology is an emerging discipline that combines high-content, multiplexed
      measurements with informatic and computational modeling methods to better
      understand biological function at various scales. Here we present a detailed
      review of the methods used to create computational models and conduct simulations
      of immune function, We provide descriptions of the key data gathering techniques 
      employed to generate the quantitative and qualitative data required for such
      modeling and simulation and summarize the progress to date in applying these
      tools and techniques to questions of immunological interest, including infectious
      disease. We include comments on what insights modeling can provide that
      complement information obtained from the more familiar experimental discovery
      methods used by most investigators and why quantitative methods are needed to
      eventually produce a better understanding of immune system operation in health
      and disease.

TI  - Large-scale phosphoproteomic analysis of membrane proteins in renal proximal and 
      distal tubule.
PG  - C755-70
AB  - Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS) have provided means for large-scale
      phosphoproteomic profiling of specific tissues. Here, we report results from
      large-scale tandem MS [liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS]-based phosphoproteomic
      profiling of biochemically isolated membranes from the renal cortex, with focus
      on transporters and regulatory proteins. Data sets were filtered (by target-decoy
      analysis) to limit false-positive identifications to <2%. A total of 7,125 unique
      nonphosphorylated and 743 unique phosphorylated peptides were identified. Among
      the phosphopeptides identified were sites on transporter proteins, i.e., solute
      carrier (Slc, n = 63), ATP-binding cassette (Abc, n = 4), and aquaporin (Aqp, n =
      3) family proteins. Database searches reveal that a majority of the
      phosphorylation sites identified in transporter proteins were previously
      unreported. Most of the Slc family proteins are apical or basolateral
      transporters expressed in proximal tubule cells, including proteins known to
      mediate transport of glucose, amino acids, organic ions, and inorganic ions. In
      addition, we identified potentially important phosphorylation sites for transport
      proteins from distal nephron segments, including the bumetanide-sensitive
      Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (Slc12a1 or NKCC2) at Ser87, Thr101, and Ser126 and the
      thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (Slc12a3 or NCC) at Ser71 and Ser124. A
      subset of phosphorylation sites in regulatory proteins coincided with known
      functional motifs, suggesting specific regulatory roles. An online database from 
      this study (http://dir.nhlbi.nih.gov/papers/lkem/rcmpd/) provides a resource for 
      future studies of transporter regulation.

      response to mitogenic stimuli provides an excellent paradigm to decipher the
      mechanisms mediating precise gene expression control at the transcriptional
      level. Here we review recent advances in our understanding of this so called
      serum response network, which illuminate novel aspects of nuclear signaling
      mechanisms, combinatorial control by DNA binding proteins and regulation of RNA
      polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation.

TI  - Structure-based Systems Biology for Analyzing Off-target Binding.
PG  - 189-99
AB  - Here off-target binding implies the binding of a small molecule of therapeutic
      interest to a protein target other than the primary target for which it was
      intended. Increasingly such off-targeting appears to be the norm rather than the 
      exception, rational drug design notwithstanding, and can lead to detrimental
      side-effects, or opportunities to reposition a therapeutic agent to treat a
      different condition. Not surprisingly, there is significant interest in
      determining a priori what off-targets exist on a proteome-wide scale. Beyond
      determining putative off-targets is the need to understand the impact of such
      binding on the complete biological system, with the ultimate goal of being able
      to predict the phenotypic outcome. While a very ambitious goal, some progress is 
      being made.

TI  - Diverse protein kinase interactions identified by protein microarrays reveal
      novel connections between cellular processes.
PG  - 767-78
AB  - Protein kinases are key regulators of cellular processes. In spite of
      considerable effort, a full understanding of the pathways they participate in
      remains elusive. We globally investigated the proteins that interact with the
      majority of yeast protein kinases using protein microarrays. Eighty-five kinases 
      were purified and used to probe yeast proteome microarrays.
      One-thousand-twenty-three interactions were identified, and the vast majority
      were novel. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicate that many of these
      interactions occurred in vivo. Many novel links of kinases to previously distinct
      cellular pathways were discovered. For example, the well-studied Kss1 filamentous
      pathway was found to bind components of diverse cellular pathways, such as those 
      of the stress response pathway and the Ccr4–Not transcriptional/translational
      regulatory complex; genetic tests revealed that these different components
      operate in the filamentation pathway in vivo. Overall, our results indicate that 
      kinases operate in a highly interconnected network that coordinates many
      activities of the proteome. Our results further demonstrate that protein
      microarrays uncover a diverse set of interactions not observed previously.

TI  - Importance of Manual Validation for the Identification of Phosphopeptides Using a
      Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer.
PG  - 10-20
AB  - Accurate determination of protein phosphorylation is challenging, particularly
      for researchers who lack access to a high-accuracy mass spectrometer. In this
      study, multiple protocols were used to enrich phosphopeptides, and a rigorous
      filtering workflow was used to analyze the resulting samples. Phosphopeptides
      were enriched from cultured rat renal proximal tubule cells using three commonly 
      used protocols and a dual method that combines separate immobilized metal
      affinity chromatography (IMAC) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) chromatography, termed
      dual IMAC (DIMAC). Phosphopeptides from all four enrichment strategies were
      analyzed by liquid chromatography-multiple levels of mass spectrometry (LC-MSn)
      neutral-loss scanning using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer. Initially, the
      resulting MS2 and MS3 spectra were analyzed using PeptideProphet and database
      search engine thresholds that produced a false discovery rate (FDR) of <1.5% when
      searched against a reverse database. However, only 40% of the potential
      phosphopeptides were confirmed by manual validation. The combined analyses
      yielded 110 confidently identified phosphopeptides. Using less-stringent initial 
      filtering thresholds (FDR of 7–9%), followed by rigorous manual validation, 262
      unique phosphopeptides, including 111 novel phosphorylation sites, were
      identified confidently. Thus, traditional methods of data filtering within widely
      accepted FDRs were inadequate for the analysis of low-resolution phosphopeptide
      spectra. However, the combination of a streamlined front-end enrichment strategy 
      and rigorous manual spectral validation allowed for confident phosphopeptide
      identifications from a complex sample using a low-resolution ion trap mass
      spectrometer.

TI  - Mitogen activated protein kinase at the nuclear pore complex.
PG  - 928-37
AB  - Mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases control eukaryotic proliferation, and
      import of kinases into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) can
      influence gene expression to affect cellular growth, cell viability and
      homeostatic function. The NPC is a critical regulatory checkpoint for
      nucleocytoplasmic traffic that regulates gene expression and cell growth, and MAP
      kinases may be physically associated with the NPC to modulate transport. In the
      present study, highly enriched NPC fractions were isolated and investigated for
      associated kinases and/or activity. Endogenous kinase activity was identified
      within the NPC fraction, which phosphorylated a 30 kD nuclear pore protein.
      Phosphomodification of this nucleoporin, here termed Nup30, was inhibited by
      apigenin and PD-98059, two MAP kinase antagonists as well as with SB-202190, a
      pharmacological blocker of p38. Furthermore, high throughput profiling of
      enriched NPCs revealed constitutive presence of all members of the MAP kinase
      family, extracellular regulated kinases (ERK), p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase. The
      NPC thus contains a spectrum of associated MAP kinases that suggests an intimate 
      role for ERK and p38 in regulation of nuclear pore function.

TI  - Large Scale Phosphoproteome Profiles Comprehensive Features of Mouse Embryonic
      Stem Cells*.
LID - M110.001750
AB  - Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent and capable of unlimited self-renewal.
      Elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanism may contribute to the
      advancement of cell-based regenerative medicine. In the present work, we
      performed a large scale analysis of the phosphoproteome in mouse embryonic stem
      (mES) cells. Using multiplex strategies, we detected 4581 proteins and 3970 high 
      confidence distinct phosphosites in 1642 phosphoproteins. Notably, 22 prominent
      phosphorylated stem cell marker proteins with 39 novel phosphosites were
      identified for the first time by mass spectrometry, including phosphorylation
      sites in NANOG (Ser-65) and RE1 silencing transcription factor (Ser-950 and
      Thr-953). Quantitative profiles of NANOG peptides obtained during the
      differentiation of mES cells revealed that the abundance of phosphopeptides and
      non-phosphopeptides decreased with different trends. To our knowledge, this study
      presents the largest global characterization of phosphorylation in mES cells.
      Compared with a study of ultimately differentiated tissue cells, a bioinformatics
      analysis of the phosphorylation data set revealed a consistent phosphorylation
      motif in human and mouse ES cells. Moreover, investigations into phosphorylation 
      conservation suggested that phosphoproteins were more conserved in the
      undifferentiated ES cell state than in the ultimately differentiated tissue cell 
      state. However, the opposite conclusion was drawn from this conservation
      comparison with phosphosites. Overall, this work provides an overview of
      phosphorylation in mES cells and is a valuable resource for the future
      understanding of basic biology in mES cells.

TI  - The ERK Cascade: Distinct Functions within Various Subcellular Organelles.
PG  - 195-209
AB  - The extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) cascade is a central
      signaling pathway that regulates a wide variety of stimulated cellular processes,
      including mainly proliferation, differentiation, and survival, but apoptosis and 
      stress response as well. The ability of this linear cascade to induce so many
      distinct and even opposing effects after various stimulations raises the question
      as to how the signaling specificity of the cascade is regulated. Over the past
      years, several specificity-mediating mechanisms have been elucidated, including
      temporal regulation, scaffolding interactions, crosstalks with other signaling
      components, substrate competition, and multiple components in each tier of the
      cascade. In addition, spatial regulation of various components of the cascade is 
      probably one of the main ways by which signals can be directed to some downstream
      targets and not to others. In this review, we describe first the components of
      the ERK1/2 cascade and their mode of regulation by kinases, phosphatases, and
      scaffold proteins. In the second part, we focus on the role of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 
      compartmentalization in the nucleus, mitochondria, endosomes, plasma membrane,
      cytoskeleton, and Golgi apparatus. We explain that this spatial distribution may 
      direct ERK1/2 signals to regulate the organelles’ activities. However, it can
      also direct the activity of the cascade’s components to the outer surface of the 
      organelles in order to bring them to close proximity to specific cytoplasmic
      targets. We conclude that the dynamic localization of the ERK1/2 cascade
      components is an important regulatory mechanism in determining the signaling
      specificity of the cascade, and its understanding should shed a new light on the 
      understanding of many stimulus-dependent processes.

PG  - 548-71
AB  - Molecular targeted therapy represents a promising new strategy for treating
      cancers because many small-molecule inhibitors targeting protein kinases have
      recently become available. Reverse-phase protein microarrays (RPPAs) are a useful
      platform for identifying dysregulated signaling pathways in tumors and can
      provide insight into patient-specific differences. In the present study, RPPAs
      were used to examine 60 protein end points (predominantly phosphoproteins) in
      matched tumor and nonmalignant biopsy specimens from 23 patients with head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma to characterize the cancer phosphoproteome. RPPA
      identified 18 of 60 analytes globally elevated in tumors versus healthy tissue
      and 17 of 60 analytes that were decreased. The most significantly elevated
      analytes in tumor were checkpoint kinase (Chk) 1 serine 345 (S345), Chk 2 S33/35,
      eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) S65,
      protein kinase C (PKC) ζ/ι threonine 410/412 (T410/T412), LKB1 S334, inhibitor of
      kappaB alpha (IκB-α) S32, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)
      S209, Smad2 S465/67, insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) S612, mitogen-activated
      ERK kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) S217/221, and total PKC ι. To our knowledge, this is the 
      first report of elevated PKC ι in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that may 
      have significance because PKC ι is an oncogene in several other tumor types,
      including lung cancer. The feasibility of using RPPA for developing theranostic
      tests to guide personalized therapy is discussed in the context of these data.

PG  - 4-11
AB  - Protein kinases orchestrate the activation of signalling cascades in response to 
      extracellular and intracellular stimuli to control cell growth, proliferation,
      and survival. The complexity of the numerous intracellular signalling pathways is
      highlighted by the number of kinases encoded by the human genome (539) and the
      plethora of phosphorylation sites identified in phosphoproteomic studies.
      Perturbation of these signalling networks by mutations or abnormal protein
      expression underlies the cause of many diseases including cancer. Recent RNAi
      screens and cancer genomic sequencing studies have revealed that many more
      kinases than anticipated contribute to tumorigenesis and are potential targets
      for inhibitor drug development intervention. This review will highlight recent
      insights into known pathways essential for tumorigenesis and discuss exciting new
      pathways for therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Phosphoproteome Analysis Reveals Regulatory Sites in Major Pathways of Cardiac
      Mitochondria*.
LID - M110.000117
AB  - Mitochondrial functions are dynamically regulated in the heart. In particular,
      protein phosphorylation has been shown to be a key mechanism modulating
      mitochondrial function in diverse cardiovascular phenotypes. However,
      site-specific phosphorylation information remains scarce for this organ.
      Accordingly, we performed a comprehensive characterization of murine cardiac
      mitochondrial phosphoproteome in the context of mitochondrial functional
      pathways. A platform using the complementary fragmentation technologies of
      collision-induced dissociation (CID) and electron transfer dissociation (ETD)
      demonstrated successful identification of a total of 236 phosphorylation sites in
      the murine heart; 210 of these sites were novel. These 236 sites were mapped to
      181 phosphoproteins and 203 phosphopeptides. Among those identified, 45
      phosphorylation sites were captured only by CID, whereas 185 phosphorylation
      sites, including a novel modification on ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase protein
      1 (Ser-212), were identified only by ETD, underscoring the advantage of a
      combined CID and ETD approach. The biological significance of the cardiac
      mitochondrial phosphoproteome was evaluated. Our investigations illustrated key
      regulatory sites in murine cardiac mitochondrial pathways as targets of
      phosphorylation regulation, including components of the electron transport chain 
      (ETC) complexes and enzymes involved in metabolic pathways (e.g. tricarboxylic
      acid cycle). Furthermore, calcium overload injured cardiac mitochondrial ETC
      function, whereas enhanced phosphorylation of ETC via application of phosphatase 
      inhibitors restored calcium-attenuated ETC complex I and complex III activities, 
      demonstrating positive regulation of ETC function by phosphorylation. Moreover,
      in silico analyses of the identified phosphopeptide motifs illuminated the
      molecular nature of participating kinases, which included several known
      mitochondrial kinases (e.g. pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) as well as kinases
      whose mitochondrial location was not previously appreciated (e.g. Src). In
      conclusion, the phosphorylation events defined herein advance our understanding
      of cardiac mitochondrial biology, facilitating the integration of the still
      fragmentary knowledge about mitochondrial signaling networks, metabolic pathways,
      and intrinsic mechanisms of functional regulation in the heart.

TI  - Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells receive RAF-dependent survival signals in
      response to CXCL12 that are sensitive to inhibition by sorafenib.
PG  - 882-9
AB  - The chemokine CXCL12, via its receptor CXCR4, promotes increased survival of
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells that express high levels of
      ζ-chain–associated protein (ZAP-70), a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with
      aggressive disease. In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular
      mechanisms governing this effect. Although significant differences in the
      expression or turnover of CXCR4 were not observed between ZAP-70+ and ZAP-70−
      cell samples, CXCL12 induced greater intracellular Ca2+ flux and stronger and
      more prolonged phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and
      mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) in the ZAP-70+ CLL cells. The
      CXCL12-induced phosphorylation of ERK and MEK in ZAP-70+ CLL cells was blocked by
      sorafenib, a small molecule inhibitor of RAF. Furthermore, ZAP-70+ CLL cells were
      more sensitive than ZAP-70− CLL cells to the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib in
      vitro at concentrations that can readily be achieved in vivo. The data suggest
      that ZAP-70+ CLL cells may be more responsive to survival factors, like CXCL12,
      that are elaborated by the leukemia microenvironment, and this sensitivity could 
      be exploited for the development of new treatments for patients with this
      disease. Moreover, sorafenib may have clinical activity for patients with CLL,
      particularly those with ZAP-70+ CLL.

TI  - p190RhoGEF (Rgnef) promotes colon carcinoma tumor progression via interaction
      with focal adhesion kinase.
PG  - 360-70
AB  - Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) functions downstream of integrins and growth factor
      receptors to promote tumor cell motility and invasion. In colorectal cancer, FAK 
      is activated by amidated gastrin, a pro-tumorigenic hormone. However, it is
      unclear how FAK receives signals from the gastrin receptor or other
      G-protein-coupled receptors that can promote cell motility and invasion. The Rho 
      guanine-nucleotide exchange factor p190RhoGEF (Rgnef) binds FAK and facilitates
      fibroblast focal adhesion formation on fibronectin. Here we report that Rgnef
      mRNA and protein expression is significantly increased during colorectal tumor
      progression. In human colon carcinoma cells, Rgnef complexes with FAK and upon
      gastrin stimulation, FAK translocates to newly-forming focal adhesions where it
      facilitates tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. siRNA-mediated knockdown of
      Rgnef or FAK, or pharmacological inhibition of FAK activity, is sufficient to
      block gastrin-stimulated paxillin phosphorylation, cell motility, and invadopodia
      formation in a manner dependent upon upstream cholecystokinin-2 receptor
      expression. Overexpression of the C-terminal region of Rgnef (Rgnef-C, aa
      1279-1582) but not Rgnef-CΔFAK (aa 1302-1582 lacking the FAK binding site)
      disrupted endogenous Rgnef-FAK interaction and prevented paxillin phosphorylation
      and cell motility stimulated by gastrin. Rgnef-C-expressing cells formed smaller,
      less invasive tumors with reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin upon
      orthotopic implantation, compared to Rgnef-CΔFAK-expressing cells. Our studies
      identify Rgnef as a novel regulator of colon carcinoma motility and invasion and 
      they show that a Rgnef-FAK linkage promotes colon carcinoma progression in vivo.

TI  - Finding undetected protein associations in cell signaling by belief propagation.
PG  - 882-7
AB  - External information propagates in the cell mainly through signaling cascades and
      transcriptional activation, allowing it to react to a wide spectrum of
      environmental changes. High-throughput experiments identify numerous molecular
      components of such cascades that may, however, interact through unknown partners.
      Some of them may be detected using data coming from the integration of a
      protein–protein interaction network and mRNA expression profiles. This inference 
      problem can be mapped onto the problem of finding appropriate optimal connected
      subgraphs of a network defined by these datasets. The optimization procedure
      turns out to be computationally intractable in general. Here we present a new
      distributed algorithm for this task, inspired from statistical physics, and apply
      this scheme to alpha factor and drug perturbations data in yeast. We identify the
      role of the COS8 protein, a member of a gene family of previously unknown
      function, and validate the results by genetic experiments. The algorithm we
      present is specially suited for very large datasets, can run in parallel, and can
      be adapted to other problems in systems biology. On renowned benchmarks it
      outperforms other algorithms in the field.

TI  - Phosphorylated hMSH6: DNA mismatch versus DNA damage recognition.
PG  - 36-45
AB  - DNA mismatch repair (MMR) maintains genomic integrity by correction of mispaired 
      bases and insertion-deletion loops. The MMR pathway can also trigger a DNA damage
      response upon binding of MutSα to specific DNA lesions such as O6methylguanine
      (O6meG). Limited information is available regarding cellular regulation of these 
      two different pathways. Within this report, we demonstrate that phosphorylated
      hMSH6 increases in concentration in the presence of a G:T mismatch, as compared
      to an O6meG:T lesion. TPA, a kinase activator, enhances the phosphorylation of
      hMSH6 and binding of hMutSα to a G:T mismatch, though not to O6meG:T. UCN-01, a
      kinase inhibitor, decreases both phosphorylation of hMSH6 and binding of hMutSα
      to G:T and O6meG:T. HeLa MR cells, pretreated with UCN-01 and exposed to MNNG,
      undergo activation of Cdk1 and mitosis despite phosphorylation of Chk1 and
      inactivating phosphorylation of Cdc25c. These results indicate that UCN-01 may
      inhibit an alternative cell cycle arrest pathway associated with the MMR pathway 
      that does not involve Cdc25c. In addition, recombinant hMutSα containing hMSH6
      mutated at an N-terminal cluster of 4 phosphoserines exhibits decreased
      phosphorylation and decreased binding of hMutSα to G:T and O6meG:T. Taken
      together, these results suggest a model in which the amount of phosphorylated
      hMSH6 bound to DNA is dependent on the presence of either a DNA mismatch or DNA
      alkylation damage. We hypothesize that both phosphorylation of hMSH6 and total
      concentration of bound hMutSα are involved in cellular signaling of either DNA
      mismatch repair or MMR-dependent damage recognition activities.

TI  - Mass spectrometry mapping of epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation
      related to oncogenic mutations and tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitivity.
PG  - 305-19
AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in cancer by 
      activating downstream signals important in growth and survival. Inhibitors of
      EGFR are frequently selected as treatment for cancer including lung cancer. We
      performed an unbiased and comprehensive search for EGFR phosphorylation events
      related to somatic activating mutations and EGFR inhibitor (erlotinib)
      sensitivity. EGFR immunoprecipitation combined with high resolution liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry and label free quantitation characterized EGFR
      phosphorylation. Thirty (30) phosphorylation sites were identified including 12
      tyrosine (pY), 12 serine (pS), and 6 threonine (pT). Site-specific
      phosphorylation was monitored by comparing ion signals from the corresponding
      unmodified peptide. Phosphorylation sites related to activating mutations in EGFR
      as well as sensitivity to erlotinib were identified using 31 lung cancer cell
      lines. We identified three sites (pY1092, pY1110, pY1172) correlating with
      activating mutations while three sites (pY1110, pY1172, pY1197) correlated with
      erlotinib sensitivity. Five sites (pT693, pY1092, pY1110, pY1172 and pY1197) were
      inhibited by erlotinib in concentration-dependent manner. Erlotinib sensitivity
      was confirmed using liquid chromatography coupled to multiple reaction monitoring
      (LC-MRM) and quantitative western blotting. This LC-MS/MS strategy can
      quantitatively assess site-specific EGFR phosphorylation and can identify
      relationships between somatic mutations or drug sensitivity and protein
      phosphorylation.

AB  - The stimulation of various cellular processes through extracellular signals is of
      paramount importance in biological systems and is a central focus in the
      diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. The information transfer is
      accomplished in a variety of ways by the interaction of soluble,
      matrix-associated and cell bound ligands that either bind specifically to plasma 
      membrane-associated proteins that act as receptors, or penetrate to the
      cytoplasmic/nuclear compartments to bind and activate receptors located there.
      The former class of entities generates intracellular signals that are transmitted
      and amplified by chemical modifications that are manifested as protein
      post-translational modifications (PTMs). These are both reversible and
      irreversible and range from phosphorylation of tyrosine, threonine and serine
      residues to endoproteolytic cleavages. Although the PTMs alter the activity and
      functions of many of the proteins in these cascades, the major outcomes of most
      of the signaling pathways are the activation/deactivation of transcriptional
      regulators with the concomitant changes in gene expression that generally
      underlie biological responses.

AB  - The functionally important regions of signal proteins participating in their
      specific interaction and responsible for transduction of hormonal signal into
      cell are rather short in length, having, as a rule, 8 to 20 amino acid residues. 
      Synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions are able to mimic the activated
      form of full-size signal protein and to trigger signaling cascades in the absence
      of hormonal stimulus. They modulate protein-protein interaction and influence the
      activity of signal proteins followed by changes in their regulatory and catalytic
      sites. The present review is devoted to the achievements and perspectives of the 
      study of signal protein-derived peptides and to their application as selective
      and effective regulators of hormonal signaling systems in vitro and in vivo.
      Attention is focused on the structure, biological activity, and molecular
      mechanisms of action of peptides, derivatives of the receptors, G protein α
      subunits, and the enzymes generating second messengers.

TI  - A Self-validating Quantitative Mass Spectrometry Method for Assessing the
      Accuracy of High-content Phosphoproteomic Experiments*.
LID - M110.003079
AB  - Protein kinase pathways play pivotal roles in cell signaling and biology. The
      phosphoproteome is a reflection of protein kinase pathway activation and
      therefore there is considerable interest in its quantification as a means to
      assess the wiring of signaling networks. Although different approaches for
      quantitative phosphoproteomics have been described, there is no data on how
      accurate these are for each quantified phosphorylated site. We report a liquid
      chromatography-MS approach to objectively assess data quality in high-content
      comparison of phosphoproteomes in which samples to be compared are mixed at
      different proportions. The experimental data is then used to derive a linear
      regression function that allows calculating correlation values, linearity, and
      accuracy. We applied the technique to investigate phosphorylation in P31/Fuj and 
      Kasumi-1, two leukemia cells lines showing strikingly different sensitivities to 
      scr and PI3K inhibitors. We found that phosphopeptides quantified with accuracy
      were not always quantified with precision because of low ion statistics
      contributing to variability. Thus our approach was complementary to standard
      methods for calculating the precision of replicate measurements based on the
      coefficient of variation and provided additional information on data quality for 
      each quantified phosphopeptide. We quantified > 2250 phosphorylation sites across
      cell lines with different levels of sensitivity to kinase inhibitors, of which
      1847 showed an accuracy variation of < 30% (with an overall mean of 22%).
      Hundreds of phosphorylation sites on proteins with diverse function (including
      kinases, transcription, and translation factors) showed significantly distinct
      intensities across sensitive and resistant cells lines, indicating that kinase
      pathways are differentially regulated in cancer cells of distinct sensitivity to 
      signaling inhibitors.

TI  - Quantitative Protein and mRNA Profiling Shows Selective Post-Transcriptional
      Control of Protein Expression by Vasopressin in Kidney Cells*.
LID - M110.004036
AB  - Previous studies in yeast have supported the view that post-transcriptional
      regulation of protein abundances may be more important than previously believed. 
      Here we ask the question: “In a physiological regulatory process (the response of
      mammalian kidney cells to the hormone vasopressin), what fraction of the
      expressed proteome undergoes a change in abundance and what fraction of the
      regulated proteins have corresponding changes in mRNA levels?” In humans and
      other mammals, vasopressin fulfills a vital homeostatic role (viz. regulation of 
      renal water excretion) by regulating the water channel aquaporin-2 in collecting 
      duct cells. To address the question posed, we utilized large-scale quantitative
      protein mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) employing stable isotopic labeling in
      cultured mpkCCD cells (‘SILAC’) coupled with transcriptomic profiling using
      oligonucleotide expression arrays (Affymetrix). Preliminary studies analyzing two
      nominally identical control samples by SILAC LC-MS/MS yielded a relative S.D. of 
      13% (for ratios), establishing the precision of the SILAC approach in our hands. 
      We quantified nearly 3000 proteins with nontargeted SILAC LC-MS/MS, comparing
      vasopressin- versus vehicle-treated samples. Of these proteins 786 of them were
      quantified in each of 3 experiments, allowing statistical analysis and 188 of
      these showed significant vasopressin-induced changes in abundance, including
      aquaporin-2 (20-fold increase). Among the proteins with statistically significant
      abundance changes, a large fraction (at least one-third) was found to lack
      changes in the corresponding mRNA species (despite sufficient statistical power),
      indicating that post-transcriptional regulation of protein abundance plays an
      important role in the vasopressin response. Bioinformatic analysis of the
      regulated proteins (versus all transcripts) shows enrichment of glutathione
      S-transferase isoforms as well as proteins involved in organization of the actin 
      cytoskeleton. The latter suggests that long-term regulatory processes may
      contribute to actomyosin-dependent trafficking of the water channel aquaporin-2. 
      The results provide impetus for increased focus on translational regulation and
      regulation of protein degradation in physiological control in mammalian
      epithelial cells.

TI  - Steroid hormone inactivation is required during the juvenile-adult transition in 
      Drosophila.
PG  - 895-902
AB  - Steroid hormones are systemic signaling molecules that regulate juvenile-adult
      transitions in both insects and mammals. In insects, pulses of the steroid
      hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) are generated by increased biosynthesis followed
      by inactivation/clearance. Although mechanisms that control 20E synthesis have
      received considerable recent attention, the physiological significance of 20E
      inactivation remains largely unknown. We show that the cytochrome P450 Cyp18a1
      lowers 20E titer during the Drosophila prepupal to pupal transition. Furthermore,
      this reduction of 20E levels is a prerequisite to induce βFTZ-F1, a key factor in
      the genetic hierarchy that controls early metamorphosis. Resupplying βFTZ-F1
      rescues Cyp18a1-deficient prepupae. Since Cyp18a1 is 20E-inducible, it appears
      that the increased production of steroid is responsible for its eventual decline,
      thereby generating the regulatory pulse required for proper temporal progression 
      of metamorphosis. The coupling of hormone clearance to βFTZ-F1 expression
      suggests a general mechanism by which transient signaling drives unidirectional
      progression through a multistep process.

TI  - Large-Scale Phosphoproteome of Human Whole Saliva Using
      Disulphide-Thiol-Interchange Covalent Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 19-33
AB  - Thus far only a handful of phosphoproteins with important biological functions
      have been identified and characterized in oral fluids and these include some of
      the abundant protein constituents of saliva. Whole saliva (WS) samples were
      trypsin digested followed by chemical derivatization using dithiothreitol (DTT)
      of the phospho-serine/threonine containing peptides. The DTT-phosphopeptides were
      enriched by covalent disulphide-thiol-interchange chromatography and analysis by 
      nano-flow LC-ESI-MS/MS. The specificity of DTT chemical derivatization was
      evaluated separately under different base-catalyzed conditions with NaOH and
      Ba(OH)2, blocking cysteine residues by iodoacetamide and enzymatic
      O-deglycosylation prior to DTT reaction. Further analysis of WS samples which
      were subjected to either of these conditions provided supporting evidence for
      phosphoprotein identifications. The combined chemical strategies and mass
      spectrometric analyses identified 65 phosphoproteins in WS of which 28 were based
      on two or more peptide identification criteria with high confidence, and 37 were 
      based on a single phosphopeptide identification. Most of the identified proteins,
      ~80%, were hitherto unknown phosphoprotein components. This study represents the 
      first large-scale documentation of phosphoproteins of WS. The origins and
      identity of WS phosphoproteome suggest significant implications for both basic
      science and the development of novel biomarkers/diagnostic tools for both
      systemic and oral disease states.

AB  - Reversible protein phosphorylation serves as a basis for regulating a number of
      cellular processes. Aberrant activation of kinase signaling pathways is commonly 
      associated with several cancers. Recent developments in
      phosphoprotein/phosphopeptide enrichment strategies and quantitative mass
      spectrometry have resulted in robust pipelines for high-throughput
      characterization of phosphorylation in a global fashion. Today, it is possible to
      profile site-specific phosphorylation events on thousands of proteins in a single
      experiment. The potential of this approach is already being realized to
      characterize signaling pathways that govern oncogenesis. In addition, chemical
      proteomic strategies have been used to unravel targets of kinase inhibitors,
      which are otherwise difficult to characterize. This review summarizes various
      approaches used for analysis of the phosphoproteome in general, and protein
      kinases in particular, highlighting key cancer phosphoproteomic studies.

PG  - 983-92
AB  - β-Adrenergic and angiotensin II type 1A receptors are therapeutic targets for the
      treatment of a number of common human diseases. Pharmacological agents designed
      as antagonists for these receptors have positively affected the morbidity and
      mortality of patients with hypertension, heart failure, and renal disease.
      Antagonism of these receptors, however, may only partially explain the
      therapeutic benefits of β-blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers given the
      emerging concept of functional selectivity or biased agonism. This new
      pharmacological paradigm suggests that multiple signaling pathways can be
      differentially modified by a single ligand-receptor interaction. This review
      examines the functional selectivity of β-adrenergic and angiotensin II type 1A
      receptors with respect to their ability to signal via both G protein-dependent
      and G protein-independent mechanisms, with a focus on the multifunctional protein
      β-arrestin. Also highlighted are the concept of “biased signaling” through
      β-arrestin mediated pathways, the affect of ligand/receptor modification on such 
      biased agonism, and the implications of functional selectivity for the
      development of the next generation of β-blockers and angiotensin receptor
      blockers.

TI  - Regulation of glycogen metabolism in yeast and bacteria.
PG  - 952-85
AB  - Microorganisms have the capacity to utilize a variety of nutrients and adapt to
      continuously changing environmental conditions. Many microorganisms, including
      yeast and bacteria, accumulate carbon and energy reserves to cope with starvation
      conditions temporarily present in the environment. Glycogen biosynthesis is a
      main strategy for such metabolic storage and a variety of sensing and signaling
      mechanisms have evolved in evolutionarily distant species to guarantee the
      production of this homopolysaccharide. At the most fundamental level, the
      processes of glycogen synthesis and degradation in yeast and bacteria share
      certain broad similarities. However, the regulation of these processes is
      sometimes quite distinct, indicating that they have evolved separately to respond
      optimally to the habitat conditions of each species. This review aims to
      highlight the mechanisms, both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional
      levels, which regulate glycogen metabolism in yeast and bacteria, focusing on
      selected areas where the greatest increase in knowledge has occurred during the
      last few years. In the yeast system, we focus particularly on the various
      signaling pathways that control the activity of the enzymes of glycogen storage. 
      We also discuss our recent understanding of the important role played by the
      vacuole in glycogen metabolism. In the case of bacterial glycogen, especial
      emphasis is given to aspects related with genetic regulation of glycogen
      metabolism and its connection with other biological processes.

TI  - Glycoprotein Capture and Quantitative Phosphoproteomics Indicate Coordinated
      Regulation of Cell Migration upon Lysophosphatidic Acid Stimulation*.
PG  - 2337-53
AB  - The lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a serum component that
      regulates cellular functions such as proliferation, migration, and survival via
      specific G protein-coupled receptors. The underlying signaling mechanisms are
      still incompletely understood, including those that operate at the plasma
      membrane to modulate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in LPA-promoted cell 
      migration. To explore LPA-evoked phosphoregulation with a focus on cell surface
      proteins, we combined glycoproteome enrichment by immobilized lectins with
      SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics. We performed biological replicate
      analyses in SCC-9 squamous cell carcinoma cells and repeatedly quantified the
      effect of 1.5- and 5-min LPA treatment on more than 700 distinct phosphorylations
      in lectin-purified proteins. We detected many regulated phosphorylation events on
      various types of plasma membrane proteins such as cell adhesion molecules
      constituting adherens junctions, desmosomes, and hemidesmosomes. Several of these
      LPA-regulated phosphorylation sites have been characterized in a biological
      context other than G protein-coupled receptor signaling, and the transfer of this
      functional information suggests coordinated and multifactorial cell adhesion
      control in LPA-induced cell migration. Additionally, we identified LPA-mediated
      activation loop phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase Wnk1 and verified 
      a role of Wnk1 for LPA-induced cell migration in knock-down experiments. In
      conclusion, the glycoproteome phosphoproteomics strategy described here sheds
      light on incompletely understood mechanisms in LPA-induced cell migratory
      behavior.

TI  - Multiple Decisive Phosphorylation Sites for the Negative Feedback Regulation of
      SOS1 via ERK*.
PG  - 33540-8
AB  - EGF-induced activation of ERK has been extensively studied by both experimental
      and theoretical approaches. Here, we used a simulation model based mostly on
      experimentally determined parameters to study the ERK-mediated negative feedback 
      regulation of the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, son of sevenless (SOS).
      Because SOS1 is phosphorylated at multiple serine residues upon stimulation, we
      evaluated the role of the multiplicity by building two simulation models, which
      we termed the decisive and cooperative phosphorylation models. The two models
      were constrained by the duration of Ras activation and basal phosphorylation
      level of SOS1. Possible solutions were found only in the decisive model wherein
      at least three, and probably more than four, phosphorylation sites decisively
      suppress the SOS activity. Thus, the combination of experimental approaches and
      the model analysis has suggested an unexpected role of multiple phosphorylations 
      of SOS1 in the negative regulation.

AB  - In yeast TOR and PKA pathways both control cell growth but how TORC1 and PKA

TI  - Ephrin-B1 forward signaling regulates craniofacial morphogenesis by controlling
      cell proliferation across Eph–ephrin boundaries.
PG  - 2068-80
AB  - Mutations in the X-linked human EPHRIN-B1 gene result in cleft palate and other
      craniofacial anomalies as part of craniofrontonasal syndrome (CFNS), but the
      molecular and developmental mechanisms by which ephrin-B1 controls the underlying
      developmental processes are not clear. Here we demonstrate that ephrin-B1 plays
      an intrinsic role in palatal shelf outgrowth in the mouse by regulating cell
      proliferation in the anterior palatal shelf mesenchyme. In ephrin-B1 heterozygous
      mutants, X inactivation generates ephrin-B1-expressing and -nonexpressing cells
      that sort out, resulting in mosaic ephrin-B1 expression. We now show that this
      process leads to mosaic disruption of cell proliferation and post-transcriptional
      up-regulation of EphB receptor expression through relief of endocytosis and
      degradation. The alteration in proliferation rates resulting from ectopic
      Eph–ephrin expression boundaries correlates with the more severe dysmorphogenesis
      of ephrin-B1+/− heterozygotes that is a hallmark of CFNS. Finally, by integrating
      phosphoproteomic and transcriptomic approaches, we show that ephrin-B1 controls
      proliferation in the palate by regulating the extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signal transduction pathway.

TI  - Proteomics and Ovarian Cancer: Integrating Proteomics Information Into Clinical
      Care.
PG  - 1864-72
AB  - The power of proteomics allows unparalleled opportunity to query the molecular
      mechanisms of a malignant cell and the tumor microenvironment in patients with
      ovarian cancer and other solid tumors. This information has given us insight into
      the perturbations of signaling pathways within tumor cells and has aided the
      discovery of new drug targets for the tumor and possible prognostic indicators of
      outcome and disease response to therapy. Proteomics analysis of serum and ascites
      has also given us sources with which to discover possible early markers for the
      presence of new disease and for the progression of established cancer throughout 
      the course of treatment. Unfortunately, this wealth of information has yielded
      little to date in changing the clinical care of these patients from a diagnostic,
      prognostic, or treatment perspective. The rational examination and translation of
      proteomics data in the context of past clinical trials and the design of future
      clinical trials must occur before we can march forward into the future of
      personalized medicine.

TI  - The Ca2+-dependent protein kinase CPK3 is required for MAPK-independent
      salt-stress acclimation in Arabidopsis.
PG  - 484-98
AB  - Plants use different signalling pathways to respond to external stimuli.
      Intracellular signalling via calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) or
      mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) present two major pathways that are
      widely used to react to a changing environment. Both CDPK and MAPK pathways are
      known to be involved in the signalling of abiotic and biotic stresses in animal, 
      yeast and plant cells. Here, we show the essential function of the CDPK CPK3
      (At4g23650) for salt stress acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana, and test
      crosstalk between CPK3 and the major salt-stress activated MAPKs MPK4 and MPK6 in
      the salt stress response. CPK3 kinase activity was induced by salt and other
      stresses after transient overexpression in Arabidopsis protoplasts, but
      endogenous CPK3 appeared to be constitutively active in roots and leaves in a
      strictly Ca2+-dependent manner. cpk3 mutants show a salt-sensitive phenotype
      comparable with mutants in MAPK pathways. In contrast to animal cells, where
      crosstalk between Ca2+ and MAPK signalling is well established, CPK3 seems to act
      independently of those pathways. Salt-induced transcriptional induction of known 
      salt stress-regulated and MAPK-dependent marker genes was not altered, whereas
      post-translational protein phosphorylation patterns from roots of wild type and
      cpk3 plants revealed clear differences. A significant portion of CPK3 was found
      to be associated with the plasma membrane and the vacuole, both depending on its 
      N-terminal myristoylation. An initial proteomic study led to the identification
      of 28 potential CPK3 targets, predominantly membrane-associated proteins.

TI  - Studies of Phosphoproteomic Changes Induced by Nucleophosmin-Anaplastic Lymphoma 
      Kinase (ALK) Highlight Deregulation of Tumor Necrosis Factor
      (TNF)/Fas/TNF-related Apoptosis-induced Ligand Signaling Pathway in ALK-positive 
      Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma*.
PG  - 1616-32
AB  - The oncogenic fusion protein nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK), 
      found exclusively in a subset of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma,
      promotes tumorigenesis by exerting its constitutively active tyrosine kinase
      activity. Thus, characterization of the NPM-ALK-induced changes in the
      phosphoproteome will likely provide insights into the biology of this
      oncoprotein. To achieve this goal, we used a strategy of combining sequential
      affinity purification of phosphopeptides and LC/MS. GP293 cells transfected with 
      either NPM-ALK or an NPM-ALK mutant with decreased tyrosine kinase activity
      (negative control) were used. We identified 506 phosphoproteins detectable in
      NPM-ALK-expressing cells but not in the negative control. Bioinformatics analysis
      revealed that these phosphoproteins carry a wide diversity of biological
      functions, some of which have not been described in association with NPM-ALK,
      such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/Fas/tumor necrosis factor-related
      apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL) signaling pathway and the ubiquitin proteasome
      degradation pathway. In particular, modulations of the TNF/Fas/TRAIL pathway by
      NPM-ALK were supported by our antibody microarray data. Further validation of the
      TNF/Fas/TRAIL pathway was performed in ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL)
      cell lines with knockdown of NPM-ALK using short interference RNA, resulting in
      the loss of the tyrosine phosphorylation of tumor necrosis factor
      receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) and receptor-interacting protein 1, two
      crucial TNF signaling molecules. Functional analyses revealed that knockdown of
      TRAP1 facilitated cell death induced by TRAIL or doxorubicin in ALK+ ALCL cells. 
      This suggests that down-regulation of TRAP1 in combination with TRAIL or
      doxorubicin might be a potential novel therapeutic strategy for ALK+ ALCL. These 
      findings demonstrated that our strategy allowed the identification of novel
      proteins downstream of NPM-ALK that contribute to the maintenance of neoplastic
      phenotype and holds great potential for future studies of cellular tyrosine
      kinases in normal states and diseases.

      Discovery*.
PG  - 1369-82
AB  - Plasma membrane proteins that are exposed on the cell surface have important
      biological functions, such as signaling into and out of the cells, ion transport,
      and cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The expression level of many of the
      plasma membrane proteins involved in these key functions is altered on cancer
      cells, and these proteins may also be subject to post-translational modification,
      such as altered phosphorylation and glycosylation. Additional protein alterations
      on cancer cells confer metastatic capacities, and some of these cell surface
      proteins have already been successfully targeted by protein drugs, such as human 
      antibodies, that have enhanced survival of several groups of cancer patients. The
      combination of novel analytical approaches and subcellular fractionation
      procedures has made it possible to study the plasma membrane proteome in more
      detail, which will elucidate cancer biology, particularly metastasis, and guide
      future development of novel drug targets. The technical advances in plasma
      membrane proteomics and the consequent biological revelations will be discussed
      herein. Many of the advances have been made using cancer cell lines, but because 
      the main goal of this research is to improve individualized treatment and
      increase cancer patient survival, further development is crucial to direct
      analysis of clinically relevant patient samples. These efforts include optimized 
      specimen handling and preparation as well as improved proteomics platforms.
      Identification of potentially useful proteomics-based biomarkers must be
      validated in larger, well defined retrospective and prospective clinical studies,
      and these combined efforts should result in identification of biomarkers that
      will greatly improve early detection, prognosis, and prediction of treatment
      response.

AB  - Recent structural studies of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have revealed
      unexpected diversity in the mechanisms of their activation by growth factor
      ligands. Strategies for inducing dimerization by ligand binding are surprisingly 
      diverse, as are mechanisms that couple this event to activation of the
      intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. As our understanding of these details
      becomes increasingly sophisticated, it provides an important context for
      therapeutically countering the effects of pathogenic RTK mutations in cancer and 
      other diseases. Much remains to be learned, however, about the complex signaling 
      networks downstream from RTKs and how alterations in these networks are
      translated into cellular responses.

AB  - In mice, Lkb1 deletion and activation of KrasG12D results in lung tumors with a
      high penetrance of lymph node and distant metastases. We analyzed these primary
      and metastatic de novo lung cancers with integrated genomic and proteomic
      profiles and have identified gene and phosphoprotein signatures associated with
      Lkb1 loss and progression to invasive and metastatic lung tumors. These studies
      revealed that SRC is activated in Lkb1 deficient primary and metastatic lung
      tumors and that the combined inhibition of SRC, PI3K and MEK1/2 resulted in
      synergistic tumor regression. These studies demonstrate that integrated genomic
      and proteomic analyses can be used to identify signaling pathways that may be
      targeted for treatment.

PG  - 808-12
AB  - Generation of reprogrammed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from patients
      with defined genetic disorders promises important avenues to understand the
      etiologies of complex diseases, and the development of novel therapeutic
      interventions. We have generated iPSC from patients with LEOPARD syndrome (LS;
      acronym of its main features: Lentigines, Electrocardiographic abnormalities,
      Ocular hypertelorism, Pulmonary valve stenosis, Abnormal genitalia, Retardation
      of growth and Deafness), an autosomal dominant developmental disorder belonging
      to a relatively prevalent class of inherited RAS-MAPK signaling diseases, which
      also includes Noonan syndrome (NS), with pleiomorphic effects on several tissues 
      and organ systems1,2. The patient-derived cells have a mutation in the PTPN11
      gene, which encodes the SHP2 phosphatase. The iPSC have been extensively
      characterized and produce multiple differentiated cell lineages. A major disease 
      phenotype in patients with LEOPARD syndrome is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We
      show that in vitro-derived cardiomyocytes from LS-iPSC are larger, have a higher 
      degree of sarcomeric organization and preferential localization of NFATc4 in the 
      nucleus when compared to cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells
      (HESC) or wild type (wt) iPSC derived from a healthy brother of one of the LS
      patients. These features correlate with a potential hypertrophic state. We also
      provide molecular insights into signaling pathways that may promote the disease
      phenotype.

TI  - QUANTITATIVE PHOSPHOPROTEOMIC ANALYSIS OF T CELL RECEPTOR SIGNALING IN DIABETES
      PRONE AND RESISTANT MICE.
PG  - 3135-45
AB  - Type 1 diabetes, in human patients and NOD mice, results from immune attack on
      insulin-producing beta-cells of the pancreas by autoreactive T lymphocytes. In
      NOD mice, genetically-controlled perturbations in the signaling pathways
      downstream of the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) may be instrumental in
      the altered responses of T cells, manifest as inefficient induction of apoptosis 
      after recognition of self-antigens in the thymus, or as perturbed reactivity of
      mature T cells in peripheral organs. To map this signaling difference(s), we have
      used mass spectrometry-based quantitative phosphoproteomics to compare the
      activation of primary CD4+ T cells of diabetes-prone NOD and -resistant B6.H2g7
      mice. Immunoprecipitation and IMAC purification of tyrosine-phosphorylated
      peptides, combined with a stable-isotope iTRAQ labeling, enabled us to identify
      and quantify over 77 phosphorylation events in 54 different proteins downstream
      of TCR stimulation of primary CD4+ T cells. This analysis showed a generally
      higher level of phosphotyrosine in activated NOD cells, as well as several
      phosphorylation sites that appeared to be differentially regulated in these two
      strains (involving TXK, CD5, PAG1, and ZAP-70). These data highlight the
      differences in signaling between CD4+ T cell compartments of NOD and B6g7 mice,
      and may underlie the dysregulation of T cells in NOD mice.

TI  - Quantitative Proteomics Analysis Reveals Molecular Networks Regulated by
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Level in Head and Neck Cancer.
PG  - 3073-82
AB  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in up to 90% of head and
      neck cancer (HNC), where increased expression levels of EGFR correlate with poor 
      prognosis. To date, EGFR expression levels have not predicted the clinical
      response to the EGFR-targeting therapies. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms
      underlying anti-EGFR-induced antitumor effects may shed some light on the
      mechanisms of HNC resistance to EGFR-targeting therapeutics and provide novel
      targets for improving the treatment of HNC. Here, we conducted a quantitative
      proteomics analysis to determine the molecular networks regulated by EGFR levels 
      in HNC by specifically knocking-down EGFR and employing stable isotope labeling
      with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). Following data normalization to
      minimize systematic errors and Western blotting validation, 12 proteins (e.g.,
      p21, stratifin, and maspin) and 24 proteins (e.g., cdc2 and MTA2) were found to
      be significantly upregulated or downregulated by EGFR knockdown, respectively.
      Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these proteins were mainly involved in
      long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation, cholesterol biosynthesis,
      cell proliferation, DNA replication, and apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis confirmed
      that G2/M phase progression was significantly inhibited by EGFR knockdown, a
      hypothesis generated from network modeling. Further investigation of these
      molecular networks may not only enhance our understanding of the antitumor
      mechanisms of EGFR targeting but also improve patient selection and provide novel
      targets for better therapeutics.

TI  - Activation of aortic endothelial cells by oxidized phospholipids: a
      phosphoproteomic analysis.
PG  - 2812-24
AB  - Previous studies have shown that oxidized products of the phospholipid PAPC
      (Ox-PAPC) are strong activators of aortic endothelial cells and play an important
      role in atherosclerosis and other inflammatory diseases. We and others have
      demonstrated that Ox-PAPC activates specific signaling pathways and regulates a
      large number of genes. Using a phosphoproteomic approach based on phosphopeptide 
      enrichment and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified candidate changes in
      Ox-PAPC-induced protein phosphorylation of 228 proteins. Functional annotation of
      these proteins showed an enrichment of the regulation of cytoskeleton, junctional
      components, and tyrosine kinases, all of which may contribute to the phenotypic
      and molecular changes observed in endothelial cells treated with Ox-PAPC. Many
      changes in protein phosphorylation induced by Ox-PAPC are reported here for the
      first time and provide new insights into the mechanism of activation by oxidized 
      lipids, including phosphorylation-based signal transduction.

TI  - A comparative phosphoproteomic analysis of a human tumor metastasis model using a
      label free quantitative approach.
PG  - 1842-52
AB  - Alterations in cellular phosphorylation patterns have been implicated in a number
      of diseases, including cancer, through multiple mechanisms. Herein we present a
      survey of the phosphorylation profiles of an isogenic pair of human cancer cell
      lines with opposite metastatic phenotype. Phosphopeptides were enriched from
      tumor cell lysates with titanium dioxide and zirconium dioxide, and identified
      with nano-LC-MS/MS using an automatic cross-validation of MS/MS and MS/MS/MS (MS2
      + MS3) data-dependent neutral loss method. A spectral counting quantitative
      strategy was applied to the two cell line samples on the MS2-only scan which was 
      implemented successively after each MS2 + MS3 scan in the same sample. For all
      regulated phosphopeptides reported by spectral counting analysis, sequence and
      phosphorylation site assignments were validated by a MS2 + MS3 data-dependent
      neutral loss method. With this approach, we identified over 70 phosphorylated
      sites on 27 phosphoproteins as being differentially expressed with respect to
      tumor cell phenotype. The altered expression levels of proteins identified by
      LC-MS/MS were validated using Western blotting. Using network pathway analysis,
      we observed that the majority of the differentially expressed proteins were
      highly interconnected and belong to two major intracellular signaling pathways.
      Our findings suggest that the phosphorylation of isoform A of lamin A/C and
      GTPase activating protein binding protein 1 is associated with metastatic
      propensity. The study demonstrates a quantitative and comparative proteomics
      strategy to identify differential phosphorylation patterns in complex biological 
      samples.

TI  - An Integrated Phosphoproteomics Work Flow Reveals Extensive Network Regulation in
      Early Lysophosphatidic Acid Signaling*.
PG  - 1047-62
AB  - Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induces a variety of cellular signaling pathways
      through the activation of its cognate G protein-coupled receptors. To investigate
      early LPA responses and assess the contribution of epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
      receptor transactivation in LPA signaling, we performed phosphoproteomics
      analyses of both total cell lysate and protein kinase-enriched fractions as
      complementary strategies to monitor phosphorylation changes in A498 kidney
      carcinoma cells. Our integrated work flow enabled the identification and
      quantification of more than 5,300 phosphorylation sites of which 224 were
      consistently regulated by LPA. In addition to induced phosphorylation events, we 
      also obtained evidence for early dephosphorylation reactions due to rapid
      phosphatase regulation upon LPA treatment. Phosphorylation changes induced by
      direct heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor-mediated EGF receptor activation
      were typically weaker and only detected on a subset of LPA-regulated sites,
      indicating signal integration among EGF receptor transactivation and other
      LPA-triggered pathways. Our results reveal rapid phosphoregulation of many
      proteins not yet implicated in G protein-coupled receptor signaling and point to 
      various additional mechanisms by which LPA might regulate cell survival and
      migration as well as gene transcription on the molecular level. Moreover, our
      phosphoproteomics analysis of both total lysate and kinase-enriched fractions
      provided highly complementary parts of the LPA-regulated signaling network and
      thus represents a useful and generic strategy toward comprehensive signaling
      studies on a system-wide level.

TI  - A Ras signaling complex controls the RasC-TORC2 pathway and directed cell
      migration.
PG  - 737-49
AB  - Ras was found to regulate Dictyostelium chemotaxis, but the mechanisms that
      spatially and temporally control Ras activity during chemotaxis remain largely
      unknown. We report the discovery of a Ras signaling complex that includes the Ras
      guanine exchange factor (RasGEF) Aimless, RasGEFH, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A),
      and a scaffold designated Sca1. The Sca1/RasGEF/PP2A complex is recruited to the 
      plasma membrane in a chemoattractant- and F-actin-dependent manner and is
      enriched at the leading edge of chemotaxing cells where it regulates F-actin
      dynamics and signal relay by controlling the activation of RasC and the
      downstream TORC2-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway. In addition, PKB and
      PKB-related PKBR1 phosphorylate Sca1 and regulate the membrane localization of
      the Sca1/RasGEF/PP2A complex, and thereby RasC activity, in a negative feedback
      fashion. Thus, our study uncovered a molecular mechanism whereby RasC activity
      and the spatiotemporal activation of TORC2 are tightly controlled at the leading 
      edge of chemotaxing cells.

TI  - Differential Phosphoproteomics of Fibroblast Growth Factor Signaling:
      Identification of Src Family Kinase-Mediated Phosphorylation Events.
PG  - 2317-28
AB  - Activation of signal transduction by the receptor tyrosine kinase, fibroblast
      growth factor receptor (FGFR), results in a cascade of protein−protein
      interactions that rely on the occurrence of specific tyrosine phosphorylation
      events. One such protein recruited to the activated receptor complex is the
      nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src, which is involved in both initiation and
      termination of further signaling events. To gain a further understanding of the
      tyrosine phosphorylation events that occur during FGF signaling, with a specific 
      focus on those that are dependent on Src family kinase (SFK) activity, we have
      applied SILAC combined with chemical inhibition of SFK activity to search for
      phosphorylation events that are dependent on SFK activity in FGF stimulated
      cells. In addition, we used a more targeted approach to carry out high coverage
      phosphopeptide mapping of one Src substrate protein, the multifunctional adaptor 
      Dok1, and to identify SFK-dependent Dok1 binding partners. From these analyses we
      identify 80 SFK-dependent phosphorylation events on 40 proteins. We further
      identify 18 SFK-dependent Dok1 interactions and 9 SFK-dependent Dok1
      phosphorylation sites, 6 of which had not previously been known to be
      SFK-dependent.

TI  - Systems approaches to polypharmacology and drug discovery.
PG  - 297-309
AB  - Systems biology uses experimental and computational approaches to characterize
      large sample populations systematically, process large datasets, examine and
      analyze regulatory networks, and model reactions to determine how components are 
      joined to form functional systems. Systems biology technologies, data and
      knowledge are particularly useful in understanding disease processes and drug
      actions. An important area of integration between systems biology and drug
      discovery is the concept of polypharmacology: the treatment of diseases by
      modulating more than one target. Polypharmacology for complex diseases is likely 
      to involve multiple drugs acting on distinct targets that are part of a network
      regulating physiological responses. This review discusses the current state of
      the systems-level understanding of diseases and both the therapeutic and adverse 
      mechanisms of drug actions. Drug-target networks can be used to identify multiple
      targets and to determine suitable combinations of drug targets or drugs. Thus,
      the discovery of new drug therapies for complex diseases may be greatly aided by 
      systems biology.

      cancer.
PG  - 291-9
AB  - We describe a strategy to comprehend signaling pathways active in lung cancer
      cells and targeted by dasatinib employing chemical proteomics to identify direct 
      interacting proteins combined with immunoaffinity purification of tyrosine
      phosphorylated peptides corresponding to activated tyrosine kinases. We
      identified nearly 40 different kinase targets of dasatinib. These include SFK
      members (LYN, SRC, FYN, LCK, YES), non-receptor tyrosine kinases (FRK, BRK, ACK),
      and receptor tyrosine kinases (Ephrin receptors, DDR1, EGFR). Using quantitative 
      phosphoproteomics we identified peptides corresponding to autophosphorylation
      sites of these tyrosine kinases that are inhibited in a concentration-dependent
      manner by dasatinib. Using drug resistant gatekeeper mutants, we show that SFK
      kinases, particularly SRC and FYN, as well as EGFR are relevant targets for
      dasatinib action. The combined mass spectrometry based approach described here
      provides a system-level view of dasatinib action in cancer cells and suggests
      both functional targets and rationale combinatorial therapeutic strategies.

PG  - 1-14
AB  - Stem cell research has been widely studied over the last few years and has
      attracted increasing attention from researchers in all fields of medicine due to 
      its potential to treat many previously incurable diseases by replacing damaged
      cells or tissues. As illustrated by hematopoietic stem research, understanding
      stem cell differentiation at molecular levels is essential for both basic
      research and for clinical applications of stem cells. Although multiple
      integrative analyses, such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics and
      proteomics, are required to understand stem cell biology, proteomics has a unique
      position in stem cell research. For example, several major breakthroughs in HSC
      research were due to the identification of proteins such as colony-stimulating
      factors (CSFs) and cell-surface CD molecules. In 2007, the Human Proteome
      Organization (HUPO) and the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) 
      launched the joint Proteome Biology of Stem Cells Initiative. A systematic
      proteomics approach to understanding stem cell differentiation will shed new
      light on stem cell biology and accelerate clinical applications of stem cells.

PG  - 33-42
AB  - The protein mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a central role in cell
      growth and proliferation. Excessive mTOR activity is a prominent feature of many 
      neoplasms and hamartoma syndromes, including lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a
      destructive lung disease that causes progressive respiratory failure in women.
      Although pharmacological inhibitors of mTOR should directly target the
      pathogenesis of these disorders, their clinical efficacy has been suboptimal.
      Recent scientific findings reviewed here have greatly improved our understanding 
      of mTOR signaling mechanisms, provided new insights into the control of cell
      growth and proliferation, and facilitated the development of new therapeutic
      approaches in LAM, as well as other neoplastic disorders that exhibit excessive
      mTOR activity.

      WT-PP5 or mutant inactive PP5 lead to the identification of six potential target 
      proteins of PP5 action. Four of these putative targets are known to be involved
      in DNA damage responses. Using phospho-site specific antibodies, we confirmed
      that phosphorylation of one target, ribosomal protein S6, was selectively
      decreased in cells overexpressing catalytically inactive PP5. Our findings also
      suggest that PP5 may play a role in controlling translation and in regulating
      substrates for proline-directed kinases, such as MAP kinases and cyclin-dependent
      protein kinases that are involved in response to DNA damage.

TI  - Phosphoproteomic Profiling Reveals Vasopressin-Regulated Phosphorylation Sites in
      Collecting Duct.
PG  - 303-15
AB  - Protein phosphorylation is an important component of vasopressin signaling in the
      renal collecting duct, but the database of known phosphoproteins is incomplete.
      We used tandem mass spectrometry to identify vasopressin-regulated
      phosphorylation events in isolated rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD)
      suspensions. Using multiple search algorithms to identify the phosphopeptides
      from spectral data, we expanded the size of the existing collecting duct
      phosphoproteome database from 367 to 1187 entries. Label-free quantification in
      vasopressin- and vehicle-treated samples detected a significant change in the
      phosphorylation of 29 of 530 quantified phosphopeptides. The targets include
      important structural, regulatory, and transporter proteins. The
      vasopressin-regulated sites included two known sites (Ser-486 and Ser-499)
      present in the urea channel UT-A1 and one previously unknown site (Ser-84) on
      vasopressin-sensitive urea channels UT-A1 and UT-A3. In vitro assays using
      synthetic peptides showed that purified protein kinase A (PKA) could
      phosphorylate all three sites, and immunoblotting confirmed the PKA dependence of
      Ser-84 and Ser-486 phosphorylation. These results expand the known list of
      collecting duct phosphoproteins and highlight the utility of targeted
      phosphoproteomic approaches.

TI  - Proteomic profiling of nuclei from native renal inner medullary collecting duct
      cells using LC-MS/MS.
PG  - 167-83
AB  - Vasopressin is a peptide hormone that regulates renal water excretion in part
      through its actions on the collecting duct. The regulation occurs in part via
      control of transcription of genes coding for the water channels aquaporin-2
      (Aqp2) and aquaporin-3 (Aqp3). To identify transcription factors expressed in
      collecting duct cells, we have carried out LC-MS/MS-based proteomic profiling of 
      nuclei isolated from native rat inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs). To
      maximize the number of proteins identified, we matched spectra to rat amino acid 
      sequences using three different search algorithms (SEQUEST, InsPecT, and OMSSA). 
      All searches were coupled to target-decoy methodology to limit false-discovery
      identifications to 2% of the total for single-peptide identifications. In
      addition, we developed a computational tool (ProMatch) to identify and eliminate 
      ambiguous identifications. With this approach, we identified >3,500 proteins,
      including 154 proteins classified as “transcription factor” proteins (Panther
      Classification System). Among these, are members of CREB, ETS, RXR, NFAT, HOX,
      GATA, EBOX, EGR, MYT1, KLF, and CP2 families, which were found to have
      evolutionarily conserved putative binding sites in the 5′-flanking region or
      first intron of the Aqp2 gene, as well as members of EBOX, NR2, GRE, MAZ, KLF,
      and SP1 families corresponding to conserved sites in the 5′-flanking region of
      the Aqp3 gene. In addition, several novel phosphorylation sites in nuclear
      proteins were identified using the neutral loss-scanning LC-MS3 technique. The
      newly identified proteins have been incorporated into the IMCD Proteome Database 
      (http://dir.nhlbi.nih.gov/papers/lkem/imcd/).

PG  - 43-52
AB  - RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful method to unravel the role of a given gene 
      in eukaryotic cells. The development of high throughput assay platforms such as
      fluorescence plate readers and high throughput microscopy has allowed the design 
      of genome wide RNAi screens to systemically discern members of regulatory
      networks around various cellular processes. Here we summarize the different
      strategies employed in RNAi screens to reveal regulators of transcriptional
      networks. We focus our discussion in experimental approaches designed to uncover 
      regulatory interactions modulating transcription factor activity.

TI  - SHIP2, a factor associated with diet-induced obesity and insulin sensitivity,
      attenuates FGF signaling in vivo.
PG  - 733-42
AB  - SH2-domain-containing inositol phosphatase 2 (SHIP2) belongs to a small family of
      phosphoinositide 5-phosphatases that help terminate intracellular signaling
      initiated by activated receptor tyrosine kinases. Mammalian SHIP2 is viewed
      primarily as an attenuator of insulin signaling and has become a prominent
      candidate target for therapeutic agents that are designed to augment insulin
      signaling. Despite this view, no signaling pathway has yet been demonstrated as
      being affected directly by SHIP2 function in vivo, and in vitro studies indicate 
      that the protein may function in multiple signaling pathways. Here, we analyze
      the role of a SHIP2 family member in the early zebrafish embryo where
      developmental and gene expression defects can be used to assay specific signaling
      pathways. The zebrafish ship2a transcript is maternally supplied, and inhibiting 
      the expression of its protein product results in the expansion of dorsal tissue
      fates at the expense of ventral ones. We show that the developmental defects are 
      the result of perturbation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in the
      early embryo. Loss of Ship2a leads to an increased and expanded expression of
      outputs of FGF-mediated signaling, including FGF-dependent gene expression and
      activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Our findings
      demonstrate that Ship2a attenuates the FGF signaling pathway in vivo and
      functions in the establishment of normal tissue patterning in the early embryo.
      We suggest that modulation of FGF signaling may be a principal function of SHIP2 
      in mammals.

TI  - Targeting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer:
      Current Knowledge and Future Challenges.
LID - 568938
AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor is overexpressed in up to 60% of ovarian
      epithelial malignancies. EGFR regulates complex cellular events due to the large 
      number of ligands, dimerization partners, and diverse signaling pathways engaged.
      In ovarian cancer, EGFR activation is associated with increased malignant tumor
      phenotype and poorer patient outcome. However, unlike some other EGFR-positive
      solid tumors, treatment of ovarian tumors with anti-EGFR agents has induced
      minimal response. While the amount of information regarding EGFR-mediated
      signaling is considerable, current data provides little insight for the lack of
      efficacy of anti-EGFR agents in ovarian cancer. More comprehensive, systematic,
      and well-defined approaches are needed to dissect the roles that EGFR plays in
      the complex signaling processes in ovarian cancer as well as to identify
      biomarkers that can accurately predict sensitivity toward EGFR-targeted
      therapeutic agents. This new knowledge could facilitate the development of
      rational combinatorial therapies to sensitize tumor cells toward EGFR-targeted
      therapies.

      regulatory networks. We describe the integration of these analyses with
      pharmacology, which leads to new understanding of drug action and enables drug
      discovery for complex diseases. Network studies of drug-target relationships can 
      serve as an indication on the general trends in the approved drugs and the
      drug-discovery progress. There is a growing number of targeted therapies approved
      and in the pipeline, which meets a new set of problems with efficacy and adverse 
      effects. The pitfalls of these mechanistically based drugs are described, along
      with how a systems view of drug action is increasingly important to uncover
      intricate signaling mechanisms that play an important part in drug action,
      resistance mechanisms, and off-target effects. Computational methodologies enable
      the classification of drugs according to their structures and to which proteins
      they bind. Recent studies have combined the structural analyses with analysis of 
      regulatory networks to make predictions about the therapeutic effects of drugs
      for complex diseases and possible off-target effects.

TI  - Phosphorylation of nucleoporins: Signal transduction-mediated regulation of their
      interaction with nuclear transport receptors.
PG  - 309-13
AB  - The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is composed of ∼30 unique proteins, collectively
      referred to as nucleoporins or Nups. While metazoan Nups are known to be
      phosphorylated during mitosis to cause disassembly of the NPC, what is less clear
      is whether Nups are phosphorylated and regulated by extracellular stimuli in
      interphase cells. Our multi-step phosphoproteomic approach revealed a number of
      physiologically relevant extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) targets,
      including Nups containing FG repeats (FG Nups) that provide binding sites for
      nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) during the NPC passage. The phosphorylation of
      FG Nups by ERK does not affect the overall architecture of the NPC but directly
      inhibits their interactions with NTRs and regulates the permeability barrier
      properties of the NPC. Such regulation at the levels of transport machinery is
      expected to have a broad impact on cellular physiology through the spatiotemporal
      control of signaling events. Until recently, many studies have focused on
      cellular signaling-mediated phosphorylation of individual cargo proteins, such as
      transcription factors. An understanding of the effects of signaling pathways on
      nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery is only beginning to emerge.

TI  - Traffic control at the nuclear pore.
PG  - 237-44
AB  - The proper communication between organelles is essential for many aspects of
      eukaryotic life. The coordination of nuclear and cytoplasmic activities in
      particular is of pivotal importance and depends on transport in and out of the
      nucleus. The material which translocates through nuclear pores is diverse; it
      includes numerous proteins, RNAs and large ribonucleoprotein complexes like
      ribosomal subunits. To ensure the correct nucleocytoplasmic distribution of these
      components, appropriate mechanisms have to be in place which control traffic
      across the nuclear envelope. A growing number of studies support the notion that 
      transport through nuclear pore complexes is intimately linked to cell physiology.
      As such, it has become evident that changes in the cellular environment, either
      by externally applied stress, aging or disease, alter nuclear traffic. Due to the
      progress made in the past few years, we are now beginning to understand these
      processes at the molecular level. Thus, the concept emerges that stress or
      disease conditions correlate with signaling events which aim at the nuclear
      transport apparatus. Here, we summarize results from recent publications that
      provide evidence for the hypothesis that changes in cell physiology modulate
      nuclear traffic by targeting multiple transport factors. We propose that this
      traffic control is at least in part mediated by specific signaling events.

TI  - The mechanism and implications of hScrib regulation of ERK.
PG  - 108-12
AB  - Scribble is a potential tumor suppressor protein, whose loss is a frequent event 
      in late stage cancer development. In both Drosophila and mammalian model systems,
      Scribble has been shown capable of regulating cell polarity, cell proliferation
      and apoptosis. Although several interacting partners, including βPiX, have been
      identified that help to explain how Scribble can regulate cell polarity and
      migration, little is known about how Scribble can control cell proliferation.
      Recent work from our laboratory has shown that Scribble can directly regulate the
      ERK signaling pathway. This is mediated by a direct protein-protein interaction
      between Scribble and ERK, which has two components. In the first, Scribble
      appears to anchor ERK at membrane-bound sites, with the loss of Scribble
      enhancing ERK nuclear translocation. In the second, Scribble can decrease the
      levels of active phosphorylated ERK, a function that is dependent upon the
      ability of Scribble to bind ERK directly. One of the consequences of this
      activity of Scribble is the inhibition of EJ-ras induced cell transformation.
      These results provide some of the first direct mechanistic information on how
      Scribble can regulate cell proliferation and, furthermore, they provide
      indications as to the identity of other signaling intermediates that may be
      recruited by Scribble to directly regulate mitogenic signaling pathways.

AB  - One of the most exciting developments in signal transduction research has been
      the proliferation of studies in which a biological discovery was initiated by
      computational modeling. Here we review the major efforts that enable such
      studies. First, we describe the experimental technologies that are generally used
      to identify the molecular components and interactions in, and dynamic behavior
      exhibited by, a network of interest. Next, we review the mathematical approaches 
      that are used to model signaling network behavior. Finally, we focus on three
      specific instances of “model-driven discovery”: cases in which computational
      modeling of a signaling network has led to new insights which have been verified 
      experimentally.Signal transduction networks are the bridge between the
      extraordinarily complex extracellular environment and a carefully orchestrated
      cellular response. These networks are largely composed of proteins which can
      interact, move to specific cellular locations, or be modified or degraded. The
      integration of these events often leads to the activation or inactivation of
      transcription factors, which then induce or repress the expression of thousands
      of genes.Because of this critical role in translating environmental cues to
      cellular behaviors, malfunctioning signaling networks can lead to a variety of
      pathologies. One example is cancer, in which many of the key genes found to be
      involved in cancer onset and development are components of signaling pathways [1,
      2]. A detailed understanding of the cellular signaling networks underlying such
      diseases would likely be extremely useful in developing new treatments.However,
      the complexity of signaling networks is such that their integrated functions
      cannot be determined without computational simulation. In recent years,
      mathematical modeling of signal transduction has led to some exciting new
      findings and biological discoveries. Here, we review the work that has enabled
      computational modeling of mammalian signaling networks, as well as the
      demonstrated value of such modeling. We begin by reviewing the experimental
      techniques commonly associated with model-building efforts, in terms of mapping
      network interactions as well as determining the dynamic network response to
      perturbation. We then discuss modeling strategies, and finally focus on three
      cases that dramatically illustrate the power of models to discover new biology.

AB  - Recent efforts in systematically profiling embryonic stem (ES) cells have yielded
      a wealth of high-throughput data. Complementarily, emerging databases and
      computational tools facilitate ES cell studies and further pave the way toward
      the in silico reconstruction of regulatory networks encompassing multiple
      molecular layers. Here, we briefly survey databases, algorithms, and software
      tools used to organize and analyze high-throughput experimental data collected to
      study mammalian cellular systems with a focus on ES cells. The vision of using
      heterogeneous data to reconstruct a complete multilayered ES cell regulatory
      network is discussed. This review also provides an accompanying manually
      extracted dataset of different types of regulatory interactions from
      low-throughput experimental ES cell studies available at

AB  - In order to understand how a cancer cell is functionally different from a normal 
      cell it is necessary to assess the complex network of pathways involving gene
      regulation, signaling, and cell metabolism, and the alterations in its dynamics
      caused by the several different types of mutations leading to malignancy. Since
      the network is typically complex, with multiple connections between pathways and 
      important feedback loops, it is crucial to represent it in the form of a
      computational model that can be used for a rigorous analysis. This is the
      approach of systems biology, made possible by new –omics data generation
      technologies. The goal of this review is to illustrate this approach and its
      utility for our understanding of cancer. After a discussion of recent progress
      using a network-centric approach, three case studies related to diagnostics,
      therapy, and drug development are presented in detail. They focus on breast
      cancer, B cell lymphomas, and colorectal cancer. The discussion is centered on
      key mathematical and computational tools common to a systems biology approach.

TI  - Concurrent Quantification of Proteome and Phosphoproteome to Reveal System-wide
      Association of Protein Phosphorylation and Gene Expression*.
PG  - 2809-26
AB  - Reversible phosphorylation of proteins is an important process modulating
      cellular activities from upstream, which mainly involves sequential
      phosphorylation of signaling molecules, to downstream where phosphorylation of
      transcription factors regulates gene expression. In this study, we combined
      quantitative labeling with multidimensional liquid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry to monitor the proteome and phosphoproteome changes in the initial
      period of adipocyte differentiation. The phosphorylation level of a specific
      protein may be regulated by a kinase or phosphatase without involvement of gene
      expression or as a phenomenon that accompanies the alteration of its gene
      expression. Concurrent quantification of phosphopeptides and non-phosphorylated
      peptides makes it possible to differentiate cellular phosphorylation changes at
      these two levels. Furthermore, on the system level, certain proteins were
      predicted as the targeted gene products regulated by identified transcription
      factors. Among them, several proteins showed significant expression changes along
      with the phosphorylation alteration of their transcription factors. This is to
      date the first work to concurrently quantify proteome and phosphoproteome changes
      during the initial period of adipocyte differentiation, providing an approach to 
      reveal the system-wide association of protein phosphorylation and gene
      expression.

TI  - O-Linked N-Acetylglucosamine Modification of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 Occurs 
      in Close Proximity to Multiple SH2 Domain Binding Motifs*.
PG  - 2733-45
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a highly phosphorylated adaptor protein
      critical to insulin and IGF-1 receptor signaling. Ser/Thr kinases impact the
      metabolic and mitogenic effects elicited by insulin and IGF-1 through feedback
      and feed forward regulation at the level of IRS-1. Ser/Thr residues of IRS-1 are 
      also O-GlcNAc-modified, which may influence the phosphorylation status of the
      protein. To facilitate the understanding of the functional effects of O-GlcNAc
      modification on IRS-1-mediated signaling, we identified the sites of O-GlcNAc
      modification of rat and human IRS-1. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of IRS-1,
      exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells, revealed that the C terminus, which is
      rich in docking sites for SH2 domain-containing proteins, was O-GlcNAc-modified
      at multiple residues. Rat IRS-1 was O-GlcNAc-modified at Ser914, Ser1009,
      Ser1036, and Ser1041. Human IRS-1 was O-GlcNAc-modified at Ser984 or Ser985, at
      Ser1011, and possibly at multiple sites within residues 1025–1045. O-GlcNAc
      modification at a conserved residue in rat (Ser1009) and human (Ser1011) IRS-1 is
      adjacent to a putative binding motif for the N-terminal SH2 domains of p85α and
      p85β regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the tyrosine
      phosphatase SHP2 (PTPN11). Immunoblot analysis using an antibody generated
      against human IRS-1 Ser1011 GlcNAc further confirmed the site of attachment and
      the identity of the +203.2-Da mass shift as β-N-acetylglucosamine. The
      accumulation of IRS-1 Ser1011 GlcNAc in HEPG2 liver cells and MC3T3-E1
      preosteoblasts upon inhibition of O-GlcNAcase indicates that O-GlcNAcylation of
      endogenously expressed IRS-1 is a dynamic process that occurs at normal glucose
      concentrations (5 mm). O-GlcNAc modification did not occur at any known or newly 
      identified Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites and in most cases occurred
      simultaneously with phosphorylation of nearby residues. These findings suggest
      that O-GlcNAc modification represents an additional layer of posttranslational
      regulation that may impact the specificity of effects elicited by insulin and
      IGF-1.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphokinome Analysis of the Met Pathway Activated by the Invasin
      Internalin B from Listeria monocytogenes*.
PG  - 2778-95
AB  - Stimulated by its physiological ligand, hepatocyte growth factor, the
      transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase Met activates a signaling machinery that
      leads to mitogenic, motogenic, and morphogenic responses. Remarkably, the
      food-borne human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes also promotes
      autophosphorylation of Met through its virulence factor internalin B (InlB) and
      subsequently exploits Met signaling to induce phagocytosis into a broad range of 
      host cells. Although the interaction between InlB and Met has been studied in
      detail, the signaling specificity of components involved in InlB-triggered
      cellular responses remains poorly characterized. The analysis of regulated
      phosphorylation events on protein kinases is therefore of particular relevance,
      although this could not as yet be characterized systematically by proteomics.
      Here, we implemented a new pyridopyrimidine-based strategy that enabled the
      efficient capture of a considerable subset of the human kinome in a robust
      one-step affinity chromatographic procedure. Additionally, and to gain functional
      insights into the InlB/Met-induced bacterial invasion process, a quantitative
      survey of the phosphorylation pattern of these protein kinases was accomplished. 
      In total, the experimental design of this study comprises affinity
      chromatographic procedures for the systematic enrichment of kinases, as well as
      phosphopeptides; the quantification of all peptides based on the iTRAQTM reporter
      system; and a rational statistical strategy to evaluate the quality of
      phosphosite regulations. With this improved chemical proteomics strategy, we
      determined and relatively quantified 143 phosphorylation sites detected on 94
      human protein kinases. Interestingly, InlB-mediated signaling shows striking
      similarities compared with the natural ligand hepatocyte growth factor that was
      intensively studied in the past. In addition, this systematic approach suggests a
      new subset of protein kinases including Nek9, which are differentially
      phosphorylated after short time (4-min) treatment of cells with the
      Met-activating InlB321. Thus, this quantitative phosphokinome study suggests a
      general, hypothesis-free concept for the detection of dynamically regulated
      protein kinases as novel signaling components involved in host-pathogen
      interactions.

      platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signaling pathway. c-Src has been 
      shown to mediate the mitogenic response to PDGF in fibroblasts. However, the
      exact components of PDGF receptor signaling pathway mediated by c-Src remain
      unclear. Here, we used stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture
      (SILAC) coupled with mass spectrometry to identify Src family kinase substrates
      involved in PDGF signaling. Using SILAC, we were able to detect changes in
      tyrosine phosphorylation patterns of 43 potential c-Src kinase substrates in PDGF
      receptor signaling. This included 23 known c-Src kinase substrates, of which 16
      proteins have known roles in PDGF signaling while the remaining 7 proteins have
      not previously been implicated in PDGF receptor signaling. Importantly, our
      analysis also led to identification of 20 novel Src family kinase substrates, of 
      which 5 proteins were previously reported as PDGF receptor signaling pathway
      intermediates while the remaining 15 proteins represent novel signaling
      intermediates in PDGF receptor signaling. In validation experiments, we
      demonstrated that PDGF indeed induced the phosphorylation of a subset of
      candidate Src family kinase substrates – Calpain 2, Eps15 and Trim28 – in a
      c-Src-dependent fashion.

TI  - Identifying Drug Effects via Pathway Alterations using an Integer Linear
      Programming Optimization Formulation on Phosphoproteomic Data.
LID - e1000591
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms of cell function and drug action is a major endeavor
      in the pharmaceutical industry. Drug effects are governed by the intrinsic
      properties of the drug (i.e., selectivity and potency) and the specific signaling
      transduction network of the host (i.e., normal vs. diseased cells). Here, we
      describe an unbiased, phosphoproteomic-based approach to identify drug effects by
      monitoring drug-induced topology alterations. With our proposed method, drug
      effects are investigated under diverse stimulations of the signaling network.
      Starting with a generic pathway made of logical gates, we build a cell-type
      specific map by constraining it to fit 13 key phopshoprotein signals under 55
      experimental conditions. Fitting is performed via an Integer Linear Program (ILP)
      formulation and solution by standard ILP solvers; a procedure that drastically
      outperforms previous fitting schemes. Then, knowing the cell's topology, we
      monitor the same key phosphoprotein signals under the presence of drug and we
      re-optimize the specific map to reveal drug-induced topology alterations. To
      prove our case, we make a topology for the hepatocytic cell-line HepG2 and we
      evaluate the effects of 4 drugs: 3 selective inhibitors for the Epidermal Growth 
      Factor Receptor (EGFR) and a non-selective drug. We confirm effects easily
      predictable from the drugs' main target (i.e., EGFR inhibitors blocks the EGFR
      pathway) but we also uncover unanticipated effects due to either drug promiscuity
      or the cell's specific topology. An interesting finding is that the selective
      EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib inhibits signaling downstream the Interleukin-1alpha
      (IL1α) pathway; an effect that cannot be extracted from binding affinity-based
      approaches. Our method represents an unbiased approach to identify drug effects
      on small to medium size pathways which is scalable to larger topologies with any 
      type of signaling interventions (small molecules, RNAi, etc). The method can
      reveal drug effects on pathways, the cornerstone for identifying mechanisms of
      drug's efficacy.

TI  - Sensing the Insulin Signaling Pathway with an Antibody Array.
PG  - 1440-50
AB  - The development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes is determined by
      various factors, including defects within the insulin signaling pathway.
      Mediators of insulin resistance operate through activation of various protein
      kinase C (PKC) isoforms, IκB kinase β (IKKβ) and/or c-Jun N-terminal kinase
      (JNK), and subsequent inhibition of the proximal insulin signaling pathway via
      the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and Akt. These mechanisms are still
      largely unresolved because of the complexity of the molecular events. In this
      study, an expression and activation state profiling of multiple known key
      signaling biomolecules involved in insulin metabolic and mitogenic signaling
      pathways was evaluated using a phosphospecific antibody array platform. The
      results of the arrayed antibodies were verified by the multiplexed bead array
      assay and conventional western blot analysis, and confirmed the well-known
      inhibitory effects of phorbol esters on insulin signaling pathway activation. Of 
      interest, the increase in PKC signaling responses with phorbol esters was
      associated with activation of the lipid phosphatase PTEN and a 27 kDa heat shock 
      protein. Thus, this insulin signaling antibody array provides a powerful and
      effective way to investigate the mechanism of insulin resistance and likely
      assist the development of innovative therapeutic drugs for type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Multiple myeloma phosphotyrosine proteomic profile associated with FGFR3
      expression, ligand activation, and drug inhibition.
PG  - 20127-32
AB  - Signaling by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases is manifest through networks
      of proteins that are substrates and/or bind to the activated receptors. FGF
      receptor-3 (FGFR3) is a drug target in a subset of human multiple myelomas (MM)
      and is mutationally activated in some cervical and colon and many bladder cancers
      and in certain skeletal dysplasias. To define the FGFR3 network in multiple
      myeloma, mass spectrometry was used to identify and quantify phosphotyrosine (pY)
      sites modulated by FGFR3 activation and inhibition in myeloma-derived KMS11
      cells. Label-free quantification of peptide ion currents indicated the activation
      of FGFR3 by phosphorylation of tandem tyrosines in the kinase domain activation
      loop when cellular pY phosphatases were inhibited by pervanadate. Among the 175
      proteins that accumulated pY in response to pervanadate was a subset of 52
      including FGFR3 that contained a total of 61 pY sites that were sensitive to
      inhibition by the FGFR3 inhibitor PD173074. The FGFR3 isoform containing the
      tandem pY motif in its activation loop was targeted by PD173074. Forty of the
      drug-sensitive pY sites, including two located within the 35-residue cytoplasmic 
      domain of the transmembrane growth factor binding proteoglycan (and multiple
      myeloma biomarker) Syndecan-1/CD138, were also stimulated in cells treated with
      the ligand FGF1, providing additional validation of their link to FGFR3. The
      identification of these overlapping sets of co-modulated tyrosine
      phosphorylations presents an outline of an FGFR3 network in the MM model and
      demonstrates the potential for pharmacodynamic monitoring by label-free
      quantitative phospho-proteomics.

TI  - In vivo Phosphoproteome of Human Skeletal Muscle Revealed by Phosphopeptide
      Enrichment and HPLC-ESI-MS/MS.
PG  - 4954-65
AB  - Protein phosphorylation plays an essential role in signal transduction pathways
      that regulate substrate and energy metabolism, contractile function, and muscle
      mass in human skeletal muscle. Abnormal phosphorylation of signaling enzymes has 
      been identified in insulin resistant muscle using phosphoepitope-specific
      antibodies, but its role in other skeletal muscle disorders remains largely
      unknown. This may be in part due to insufficient knowledge of relevant targets.
      Here, we therefore present the first large-scale in vivo phosphoproteomic study
      of human skeletal muscle from 3 lean, healthy volunteers. Trypsin digestion of
      3-5 mg human skeletal muscle protein was followed by phosphopeptide enrichment
      using SCX and TiO2. The resulting phosphopeptides were analyzed by
      HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Using this unbiased approach, we identified 306 distinct in vivo 
      phosphorylation sites in 127 proteins, including 240 phosphoserines, 53
      phosphothreonines and 13 phosphotyrosines in at least 2 out of 3 subjects. In
      addition, 61 ambiguous phosphorylation sites were identified in at least 2 out of
      3 subjects. The majority of phosphoproteins detected are involved in sarcomeric
      function, excitation-contraction coupling (the Ca2+-cycle), glycolysis and
      glycogen metabolism. Of particular interest, we identified multiple novel
      phosphorylation sites on several sarcomeric Z-disc proteins known to be involved 
      in signaling and muscle disorders. These results provide numerous new targets for
      the investigation of human skeletal muscle phosphoproteins in health and disease 
      and demonstrate feasibility of phosphoproteomics research of human skeletal
      muscle in vivo.

TI  - Differential 14-3-3 Affinity Capture Reveals New Downstream Targets of
      Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Signaling*.
PG  - 2487-99
AB  - We devised a strategy of 14-3-3 affinity capture and release, isotope
      differential (d0/d4) dimethyl labeling of tryptic digests, and phosphopeptide
      characterization to identify novel targets of insulin/IGF1/phosphatidylinositol
      3-kinase signaling. Notably four known insulin-regulated proteins (PFK-2, PRAS40,
      AS160, and MYO1C) had high d0/d4 values meaning that they were more highly
      represented among 14-3-3-binding proteins from insulin-stimulated than
      unstimulated cells. Among novel candidates, insulin receptor substrate 2, the
      proapoptotic CCDC6, E3 ubiquitin ligase ZNRF2, and signaling adapter SASH1 were
      confirmed to bind to 14-3-3s in response to IGF1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
      signaling. Insulin receptor substrate 2, ZNRF2, and SASH1 were also regulated by 
      phorbol ester via p90RSK, whereas CCDC6 and PRAS40 were not. In contrast, the
      actin-associated protein vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and
      lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor, which had low d0/d4 scores, bound
      14-3-3s irrespective of IGF1 and phorbol ester. Phosphorylated Ser19 of ZNRF2
      (RTRAYpS19GS), phospho-Ser90 of SASH1 (RKRRVpS90QD), and phospho- Ser493 of
      lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor (RPRARpS493LD) provide one of the
      14-3-3-binding sites on each of these proteins. Differential 14-3-3 capture
      provides a powerful approach to defining downstream regulatory mechanisms for
      specific signaling pathways.

TI  - A New Approach for Quantitative Phosphoproteomic Dissection of Signaling Pathways
      Applied to T Cell Receptor Activation*.
PG  - 2418-31
AB  - Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in the regulation of
      cellular signaling pathways. Current approaches in phosphoproteomics focus on
      analysis of the global phosphoproteome in a single cellular state or of receptor 
      stimulation time course experiments, often with a restricted number of time
      points. Although these studies have provided some insights into newly discovered 
      phosphorylation sites that may be involved in pathways, they alone do not provide
      enough information to make precise predictions of the placement of individual
      phosphorylation events within a signaling pathway. Protein disruption and
      site-directed mutagenesis are essential to clearly define the precise biological 
      roles of the hundreds of newly discovered phosphorylation sites uncovered in
      modern proteomics experiments. We have combined genetic analysis with
      quantitative proteomic methods and recently developed visual analysis tools to
      dissect the tyrosine phosphoproteome of isogenic Zap-70 tyrosine kinase null and 
      reconstituted Jurkat T cells. In our approach, label-free quantitation using
      normalization to copurified phosphopeptide standards is applied to assemble high 
      density temporal data within a single cell type, either Zap-70 null or
      reconstituted cells, providing a list of candidate phosphorylation sites that
      change in abundance after T cell stimulation. Stable isotopic labeling of amino
      acids in cell culture (SILAC) ratios are then used to compare Zap-70 null and
      reconstituted cells across a time course of receptor stimulation, providing
      direct information about the placement of newly observed phosphorylation sites
      relative to Zap-70. These methods are adaptable to any cell culture signaling
      system in which isogenic wild type and mutant cells have been or can be derived
      using any available phosphopeptide enrichment strategy.

TI  - Comparison of Global versus Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Pathway Profiling
      for Prediction of Lapatinib Sensitivity in Bladder Cancer12.
PG  - 1185-93
AB  - Chemotherapy for metastatic bladder cancer is rarely curative. The recently
      developed small molecule, lapatinib, a dual epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 receptor tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor, might improve this situation. Recent findings suggest that identifying
      which patients are likely to benefit from targeted therapies is beneficial,
      although controversy remains regarding what types of evaluation might yield
      optimal candidate biomarkers of sensitivity. Here, we address this issue by
      developing and comparing lapatinib sensitivity prediction models for human
      bladder cancer cells. After empirically determining in vitro sensitivities (drug 
      concentration necessary to cause a 50% growth inhibition) of a panel of 39 such
      lines to lapatinib treatment, we developed prediction models based on profiling
      the baseline transcriptome, the phosphorylation status of EGFR pathway signaling 
      targets, or a combination of both data sets. We observed that models derived from
      microarray gene expression data showed better prediction performance (93%–98%
      accuracy) compared with models derived from EGFR pathway profiling of 23 selected
      phosphoproteins known to be involved in EGFR-driven signaling (54%–61% accuracy) 
      or from a subset of the microarray data for transcripts in the EGFR pathway (86% 
      accuracy). Combining microarray data and phosphoprotein profiling provided a
      combination model with 98% accuracy. Our findings suggest that transcriptome-wide
      profiling for biomarkers of lapatinib sensitivity in cancer cells provides models
      with excellent predictive performance and may be effectively combined with EGFR
      pathway phosphoprotein profiling data. These results have significant
      implications for the use of such tools in personalizing the approach to cancers
      treated with EGFR-directed targeted therapies.

TI  - Protein Kinase CK2 Regulates Cytoskeletal Reorganization during Ionizing
      Radiation-Induced Senescence of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells.
PG  - 8200-7
AB  - Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) are critical for tissue regeneration. How
      hMSC respond to genotoxic stresses and potentially contribute to aging and cancer
      remain underexplored. We demonstrated that ionizing radiation induced cellular
      senescence of hMSC over a period of 10 days, showing a critical transition
      between day 3 and day 6. This was confirmed by senescence-associated
      beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, protein expression profiles of key cell
      cycle regulators (retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, p53, p21waf1/Cip1, and p16INK4A), 
      and senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) (IL-8, IL-12, GRO, and
      MDC). We observed dramatic cytoskeletal reorganization of hMSC through reduction 
      of myosin-10, redistribution of myosin-9, and secretion of profilin-1. Using a
      SILAC-based phosphoproteomics method, we detected significant reduction of
      myosin-9 phosphorylation at Ser1943, coinciding with its redistribution.
      Importantly, through treatment with cell permeable inhibitors
      ((4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole (TBB) and
      2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (DMAT)), and gene knockdown
      using RNA interference, we identified CK2, a kinase responsible for myosin-9
      phosphorylation at Ser1943, as a key factor contributing to the radiation-induced
      senescence of hMSC. We showed that individual knockdown of CK2 catalytic subunits
      CK2α and CK2α′ induced hMSC senescence. However, only knockdown of CK2α resulted 
      in morphological phenotypes resembling those of radiation-induced senescence.
      These results suggest that CK2α and CK2α′ play differential roles in hMSC
      senescence progression, and their relative expression might represent a novel
      regulatory mechanism for CK2 activity.

PG  - 933-40
AB  - Constitutive activation of one or more kinase signaling pathways is a hallmark of
      many cancers. Here we extend the previously described mass spectrometry–based
      KAYAK approach by monitoring kinase activities from multiple signaling pathways
      simultaneously. This improved single-reaction strategy, which quantifies the
      phosphorylation of 90 synthetic peptides in a single mass spectrometry run, is
      compatible with nanogram to microgram amounts of cell lysate. Furthermore, the
      approach enhances kinase monospecificity through substrate competition effects,
      faithfully reporting the signatures of many signaling pathways after mitogen
      stimulation or of basal pathway activation differences across a panel of
      well-studied cancer cell lines. Hierarchical clustering of activities from
      related experiments groups peptides phosphorylated by similar kinases together
      and, when combined with pathway alteration using pharmacological inhibitors,
      distinguishes underlying differences in potency, off-target effects and genetic
      backgrounds. Finally, we introduce a strategy to identify the kinase, and even
      associated protein complex members, responsible for phosphorylation events of
      interest.

TI  - Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Phosphorylation Sites Ser991 and Tyr998 Are
      Implicated in the Regulation of Receptor Endocytosis and Phosphorylations at
      Ser1039 and Thr1041*.
PG  - 2131-44
AB  - Aberrant expression, activation, and down-regulation of the epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR) have causal roles in many human cancers, and
      post-translational modifications including phosphorylation and ubiquitination and
      protein-protein interactions directly modulate EGFR function. Quantitative mass
      spectrometric analyses including selected reaction monitoring (also known as
      multiple reaction monitoring) were applied to the EGFR and associated proteins.
      In response to epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation of cells,
      phosphorylations at EGFR Ser991 and Tyr998 accumulated more slowly than at
      receptor sites involved in RAS-ERK signaling. Phosphorylation-deficient mutant
      receptors S991A and Y998F activated ERK in response to EGF but were impaired for 
      receptor endocytosis. Consistent with these results, the mutant receptors
      retained a network of interactions with known signaling proteins including
      EGF-stimulated binding to the adaptor GRB2. Compared with wild type EGFR the
      Y998F variant had diminished EGF-stimulated interaction with the ubiquitin E3
      ligase CBL, and the S991A variant had decreased associated ubiquitin. The
      endocytosis-defective mutant receptors were found to have elevated
      phosphorylation at positions Ser1039 and Thr1041. These residues reside in a
      serine/threonine-rich region of the receptor previously implicated in p38
      mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent stress/cytokine-induced EGFR
      internalization and recycling (Zwang, Y., and Yarden, Y. (2006) p38 MAP kinase
      mediates stress-induced internalization of EGFR: implications for cancer
      chemotherapy. EMBO J. 25, 4195–4206). EGF-induced phosphorylations at Ser1039 and
      Thr1041 were blocked by treatment of cells with SB-202190, a selective inhibitor 
      of p38. These results suggest that coordinated phosphorylation of EGFR involving 
      sites Tyr998, Ser991, Ser1039, and Thr1041 governs the trafficking of EGF
      receptors. This reinforces the notion that EGFR function is manifest through
      spatially and temporally controlled protein-protein interactions and
      phosphorylations.

TI  - Characterization of the rapamycin-sensitive phosphoproteome reveals that Sch9 is 
      a central coordinator of protein synthesis.
PG  - 1929-43
AB  - The target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1) is an essential multiprotein complex
      conserved from yeast to humans. Under favorable growth conditions, and in the
      absence of the macrolide rapamycin, TORC1 is active, and influences virtually all
      aspects of cell growth. Although two direct effectors of yeast TORC1 have been
      reported (Tap42, a regulator of PP2A phosphatases and Sch9, an AGC family
      kinase), the signaling pathways that couple TORC1 to its distal effectors were
      not well understood. To elucidate these pathways we developed and employed a
      quantitative, label-free mass spectrometry approach. Analyses of the
      rapamycin-sensitive phosphoproteomes in various genetic backgrounds revealed both
      documented and novel TORC1 effectors and allowed us to partition phosphorylation 
      events between Tap42 and Sch9. Follow-up detailed characterization shows that
      Sch9 regulates RNA polymerases I and III, the latter via Maf1, in addition to
      translation initiation and the expression of ribosomal protein and ribosome
      biogenesis genes. This demonstrates that Sch9 is a master regulator of protein
      synthesis.

TI  - An Extensive Survey of Tyrosine Phosphorylation Revealing New Sites in Human
      Mammary Epithelial Cells.
PG  - 3852-61
AB  - Protein tyrosine phosphorylation represents a central regulatory mechanism in
      cell signaling. Here we present an extensive survey of tyrosine phosphorylation
      sites in a normal-derived human mammary epithelial cell line by applying
      anti-phosphotyrosine peptide immunoaffinity purification coupled with high
      sensitivity capillary liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 
      481 tyrosine phosphorylation sites (covered by 716 unique peptides) from 285
      proteins were confidently identified in HMEC following the analysis of both the
      basal condition and acute stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF). The
      estimated false discovery rate was 1.0% as determined by searching against a
      scrambled database. Comparison of these data with existing literature showed
      significant agreement for previously reported sites. However, we observed 281
      sites that were not previously reported for HMEC cultures and 29 of which have
      not been reported for any human cell or tissue system. The analysis showed that
      the majority of highly phosphorylated proteins were relatively low-abundance.
      Large differences in phosphorylation stoichiometry for sites within the same
      protein were also observed, raising the possibility of more important functional 
      roles for such highly phosphorylated pTyr sites. By mapping to major signaling
      networks, such as the EGF receptor and insulin growth factor-1 receptor signaling
      pathways, many known proteins involved in these pathways were revealed to be
      tyrosine phosphorylated, which provides interesting targets for future
      hypothesis-driven and targeted quantitative studies involving tyrosine
      phosphorylation in HMEC or other human systems.

TI  - A site-specific, multiplexed kinase activity assay using stable-isotope dilution 
      and high-resolution mass spectrometry.
PG  - 11606-11
AB  - Most kinases are capable of recognizing and phosphorylating peptides containing
      short, linear sequence motifs. To measure the activation state of many kinases
      from the same cell lysate, we created a multiplexed, mass-spectrometry-based in
      vitro kinase assay. Ninety chemically synthesized peptides derived from
      well-characterized peptide substrates and in vivo phosphorylation sites with
      either known or previously unidentified upstream kinases were reacted
      individually in a plate format with crude cell lysates and ATP. Phosphorylation
      rates were directly measured based on the addition of 90 same-sequence,
      site-specific phosphopeptides enriched in stable isotopes to act as ideal
      quantitative internal standards for analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to 
      tandem mass spectrometry. This approach concurrently measured up to 90
      site-specific peptide phosphorylation rates, reporting a diagnostic fingerprint
      for activated kinase pathways. We applied this unique kinome-activity profiling
      strategy in a variety of cellular settings, including mitogen stimulation, cell
      cycle, pharmacological inhibition of pathways, and to a panel of breast cancer
      cell lines. Finally, we identified the source of activity for a peptide (derived 
      from a PI3K regulatory subunit) from our library. This peptide substrate
      demonstrated mitotic and tyrosine-specific phosphorylation, which was confirmed
      to be a novel Src family kinase site in vivo.

TI  - Quantitative Proteomics Reveals a Dynamic Interactome and Phase-specific
      Phosphorylation in the Neurospora Circadian Clock.
PG  - 354-63
AB  - Circadian systems are comprised of multiple proteins functioning together to
      produce feedback loops driving robust, approximately 24 hour rhythms. In all
      circadian systems, proteins in these loops are regulated through myriad
      physically and temporally distinct post-translational modifications (PTMs). To
      better understand how PTMs impact a circadian oscillator we implemented a
      proteomics-based approach by combining purification of endogenous FREQUENCY (FRQ)
      and its interacting partners with quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). We
      identify and quantify time-of-day specific protein-protein interactions in the
      clock and show how these provide a platform for temporal and physical separation 
      between the dual roles of FRQ. Additionally, by unambiguously identifying over 75
      phosphorylated residues, following their quantitative change over a circadian
      cycle, and examining the phenotypes of strains that have lost these sites, we
      demonstrate how spatially and temporally regulated phosphorylation has opposing
      effects directly on overt circadian rhythms and FRQ stability.

TI  - The Plasticity of Oncogene Addiction: Implications for Targeted Therapies
      Directed to Receptor Tyrosine Kinases12.
PG  - 448-58
AB  - A common mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in glioblastoma 
      multiforme (GBM) is an extracellular truncation known as the de2-7 EGFR (or
      EGFRvIII). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the ligand for the receptor tyrosine
      kinase (RTK) c-Met, and this signaling axis is often active in GBM. The
      expression of the HGF/c-Met axis or de2-7 EGFR independently enhances GBMgrowth
      and invasiveness, particularly through the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/pAkt
      pathway. Using RTK arrays, we show that expression of de2-7 EGFR in U87MG GBM
      cells leads to the coactivation of several RTKs, including platelet-derived
      growth factor receptor β and c-Met. A neutralizing antibody to HGF (AMG102) did
      not inhibit de2-7 EGFR-mediated activation of c-Met, demonstrating that it is
      ligand-independent. Therapy for parental U87MG xenografts with AMG 102 resulted
      in significant inhibition of tumor growth, whereas U87MG.Δ2-7 xenografts were
      profoundly resistant. Treatment of U87MG.Δ2-7 xenografts with panitumumab, an
      anti-EGFR antibody, only partially inhibited tumor growth as xenografts rapidly
      reverted to the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway. Cotreatment with panitumumab and AMG
      102 prevented this escape leading to significant tumor inhibition through an
      apoptotic mechanism, consistent with the induction of oncogenic shock. This
      observation provides a rationale for using panitumumab and AMG 102 in combination
      for the treatment of GBM patients. These results illustrate that GBM cells can
      rapidly change the RTK driving their oncogene addiction if the alternate RTK
      signals through the same downstream pathway. Consequently, inhibition of a
      dominant oncogene by targeted therapy can alter the hierarchy of RTKs resulting
      in rapid therapeutic resistance.

TI  - Functional Proteomics Identifies Targets of Phosphorylation by B-Raf Signaling in
      Melanoma.
PG  - 115-31
AB  - Melanoma and other cancers harbor oncogenic mutations in the protein kinase
      B-Raf, which leads to constitutive activation and dysregulation of MAP kinase
      signaling. In order to elucidate molecular determinants responsible for B-Raf
      control of cancer phenotypes, we present a method for phosphoprotein profiling,
      using negative ionization mass spectrometry to detect phosphopeptides based on
      their fragment ion signature caused by release of PO3−. The method provides an
      alternative strategy for phosphoproteomics, circumventing affinity enrichment of 
      phosphopeptides and isotopic labeling of samples. Ninety phosphorylation events
      were regulated by oncogenic B-Raf signaling, based on their responses to treating
      melanoma cells with MKK1/2 inhibitor. Regulated phosphoproteins included known
      signaling effectors and cytoskeletal regulators. We investigated MINERVA/FAM129B,
      a target belonging to a protein family with unknown category and function, and
      established the importance of this protein and its MAP kinase-dependent
      phosphorylation in controlling melanoma cell invasion into 3-dimensional collagen
      matrix.

TI  - Identification and Characterization of Neuronal Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase 
      Substrates Using a Specific Phosphomotif Antibody*S⃞.
PG  - 681-95
AB  - Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) control neuronal synaptic function;
      however, little is known about the synaptic substrates regulated by MAPKs. A
      phosphopeptide library incorporating the MAPK consensus motif (PX(pS/pT)P where
      pS is phosphoserine and pT is phosphothreonine) was used to raise a
      phosphospecific antibody that detected MAPK-mediated phosphorylation. The
      antibody (termed “5557”) recognized a variety of phosphoproteins in the brain,
      many of which were enriched in postsynaptic density fractions. The immunoblot
      pattern changed rapidly in response to altered synaptic activity and with the
      inhibition of specific MAPKs and protein phosphatases. By immunoaffinity
      purification with 5557 antibody followed by mass spectrometry, we identified 449 
      putative MAPK substrates of which many appeared dynamically regulated in neuron
      cultures. Several of the novel candidate MAPK substrates were validated by in
      vitro phosphorylation assays. Additionally 82 specific phosphorylation sites were
      identified in 34 proteins, including Ser-447 in δ-catenin, a component of the
      cadherin adhesion complex. We further raised another phosphospecific antibody to 
      confirm that δ-catenin Ser-447 is modified in neurons by the MAPK JNK in a
      synaptic activity-dependent manner. Ser-447 phosphorylation by JNK appears to be 
      correlated with δ-catenin degradation, and a δ-catenin mutant defective in
      Ser-447 phosphorylation showed enhanced ability to promote dendrite branching in 
      cultured neurons. Thus, phosphomotif-based affinity purification is a powerful
      approach to identify novel substrates of MAPKs in vivo and to reveal functionally
      significant phosphorylation events.

      ALK-mediated pathogenesis and the treatment of ALCL.
PG  - 2776-90
AB  - Anaplastic large cell lymphoma represents a subset of neoplasms caused by
      translocations that juxtapose the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) to
      dimerization partners. The constitutive activation of ALK fusion proteins leads
      to cellular transformation through a complex signaling network. To elucidate the 
      ALK pathways sustaining lymphomagenesis and tumor maintenance, we analyzed the
      tyrosine-kinase protein profiles of ALK-positive cell lines using 2 complementary
      proteomic-based approaches, taking advantage of a specific ALK RNA interference
      (RNAi) or cell-permeable inhibitors. A well-defined set of ALK-associated
      tyrosine phosphopeptides, including metabolic enzymes, kinases, ribosomal and
      cytoskeletal proteins, was identified. Validation studies confirmed that
      vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide
      ribonucleotide formyltransferase/inosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase (ATIC)
      associated with nucleophosmin (NPM)–ALK, and their phosphorylation required ALK
      activity. ATIC phosphorylation was documented in cell lines and primary tumors
      carrying ALK proteins and other tyrosine kinases, including TPR-Met and wild type
      c-Met. Functional analyses revealed that ALK-mediated ATIC phosphorylation
      enhanced its enzymatic activity, dampening the methotrexate-mediated
      transformylase activity inhibition. These findings demonstrate that proteomic
      approaches in well-controlled experimental settings allow the definition of
      informative proteomic profiles and the discovery of novel ALK downstream players 
      that contribute to the maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype. Prediction of
      tumor responses to methotrexate may justify specific molecular-based
      chemotherapy.

      Protein Mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 1540-54
AB  - Vasopressin-mediated control of water permeability in the renal collecting duct
      occurs in part through regulation of the distribution of aquaporin-2 (AQP2)
      between the apical plasma membrane and intracellular membrane compartments.
      Phosphorylation of Ser-256 at AQP2's cytoplasmic COOH-terminus is well-accepted
      as a critical step for translocation. The aim of this study was to identify
      binding partners to phosphorylated versus nonphosphorylated forms of the AQP2
      COOH-terminus via a targeted comparative proteomic approach. Cytosol from inner
      medullary collecting ducts isolated from rat kidneys was incubated with “bait”
      peptides, representing the COOH-terminal AQP2 tail in its nonphosphorylated and
      phosphorylated forms, to capture differentially-bound proteins prior to LC-MS/MS 
      analysis. Mass spectrometric results were confirmed by immunoblotting.
      Immunoprecipitation was performed using an AQP2 COOH-terminal antibody combined
      with immunblotting against the proposed binding partners in order to demonstrate 
      interactions with native AQP2. Our studies confirmed previously identified
      interactions between AQP2 and hsc70, hsp70−1 and −2, as well as annexin II. These
      proteins were found to bind less to the Ser-256-phosphorylated AQP2 than to the
      non-phosphorylated form. In contrast, another heat shock protein, hsp70−5
      (BiP/grp78), bound to phosphorylated AQP2 more avidly than to non-phosphorylated 
      AQP2. Immunogold EM studies demonstrated that BiP is present not only in the ER, 
      but in the cytoplasm and apical plasma membrane of rat collecting duct cells.
      Furthermore, confocal immunofluorescence studies showed partial colocalization of
      BiP with AQP2 in non-ER compartments. These results suggest that phosphorylation 
      of AQP2 at Ser-256 may regulate AQP2 trafficking in part by mediating
      differential binding of hsp70 family proteins to the COOH-terminal tail.

TI  - The Coming of Age of Axonal Neurotrophin Signaling Endosomes.
PG  - 46-55
AB  - Neurons of both the central and the peripheral nervous system are critically
      dependent on neurotrophic signals for their survival and differentiation. The
      trophic signal is originated at the axonal terminals that innervate the
      target(s). It has been well established that the signal must be retrogradely
      transported back to the cell body to exert its trophic effect. Among the many
      forms of transmitted signals, the signaling endosome serves as a primary means to
      ensure that the retrograde signal is delivered to the cell body with sufficient
      fidelity and specificity. Recent evidence suggests that disruption of axonal
      transport of neurotrophin signals may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases
      such as Alzheimer’s disease and Down syndrome. However, the identity of the
      endocytic vesicular carrier(s), and the mechanisms involved in retrogradely
      transporting the signaling complexes remains a matter of debate. In this review, 
      we summarize current insights that are mainly based on classical
      hypothesis-driven research, and we emphasize the urgent needs to carry out
      proteomics to resolve the controversies in the field.

TI  - Proteome-Wide Identification of Novel Binding Partners to the Oncogenic Fusion
      Gene Protein, NPM-ALK, using Tandem Affinity Purification and Mass Spectrometry.
PG  - 361-70
AB  - Nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK), an oncogenic fusion gene
      protein that is characteristically found in a subset of anaplastic large cell
      lymphomas, promotes tumorigenesis through its functional and physical
      interactions with various biologically important proteins. The identification of 
      these interacting proteins has proven to be useful to further our understanding
      of NPM-ALK-mediated tumorigenesis. For the first time, we performed a
      proteome-wide identification of NPM-ALK-binding proteins using tandem affinity
      purification and a highly sensitive mass spectrometric technique. Tandem affinity
      purification is a recently developed method that carries a lower background and
      higher sensitivity compared with the conventional immunoprecipitation-based
      protein purification protocols. The NPM-ALK gene was cloned into an HB-tagged
      vector and expressed in GP293 cells. Three independent experiments were performed
      and the reproducibility of the data was 68%. The vast majority of the previously 
      reported NPM-ALK-binding proteins were detected. We also identified proteins that
      are involved in various cellular processes that were not previously described in 
      association with NPM-ALK, such as MCM6 and MSH2 (DNA repair), Nup98 and importin 
      8 (subcellular protein transport), Stim1 (calcium signaling), 82Fip (RNA
      regulation), and BAG2 (proteosome degradation). We believe that these data
      highlight the functional diversity of NPM-ALK and provide new research directions
      for the study of the biology of this oncoprotein.

TI  - Oncogenic Gene Fusions in Epithelial Carcinomas.
PG  - 82-91
AB  - New discoveries regarding recurrent chromosomal aberrations in epithelial tumors 
      have challenged the view that gene fusions play a minor role in these cancers. It
      is now known that recurrent fusions characterize significant subsets of prostate,
      breast, lung and renal-cell carcinomas, among others. This work has generated new
      insights into the molecular subtypes of tumors and highlighted important advances
      in bioinformatics, sequencing and microarray technology as tools for gene fusion 
      discovery. Given the ubiquity of tyrosine kinases and transcription factors in
      gene fusions, further interest in the potential “druggability” of gene fusions
      with targeted therapeutics has also flourished. Nevertheless, the majority of
      chromosomal abnormalities in epithelial cancers remain uncharacterized,
      underscoring the limitations of our knowledge of carcinogenesis and the
      requirement for further research.

TI  - Large-Scale Proteomics and Phosphoproteomics of Urinary Exosomes.
PG  - 363-79
AB  - Normal human urine contains large numbers of exosomes, which are 40- to 100-nm
      vesicles that originate as the internal vesicles in multivesicular bodies from
      every renal epithelial cell type facing the urinary space. Here, we used LC-MS/MS
      to profile the proteome of human urinary exosomes. Overall, the analysis
      identified 1132 proteins unambiguously, including 177 that are represented on the
      Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database of disease-related genes, suggesting
      that exosome analysis is a potential approach to discover urinary biomarkers. We 
      extended the proteomic analysis to phosphoproteomic profiling using neutral loss 
      scanning, and this yielded multiple novel phosphorylation sites, including
      serine-811 in the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl co-transporter, NCC. To demonstrate
      the potential use of exosome analysis to identify a genetic renal disease, we
      carried out immunoblotting of exosomes from urine samples of patients with a
      clinical diagnosis of Bartter syndrome type I, showing an absence of the
      sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter 2, NKCC2. The proteomic data are
      publicly accessible at http://dir.nhlbi.nih.gov/papers/lkem/exosome/.

TI  - MET as a target for treatment of chest tumours.
PG  - 169-79
AB  - The receptor tyrosine kinase MET has been studied of a large variety of human
      cancers, including lung and mesothelioma. The MET receptor and its ligand HGF
      (hepatocyte growth factor) play important roles in cell growth, survival and
      migration, and dysregulation of the HGF-MET pathway leads to oncogenic changes
      including tumor proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. In small cell lung
      cancer (SCLC), non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and malignant pleural
      mesothelioma (MPM), MET is dysregulated via overexpression, constitutive
      activation, gene amplification, ligand-dependent activation, mutation or
      epigenetic mechanisms. New drugs targeted against MET and HGF are currently being
      investigated in vitro and in vivo, with promising results. These drugs function
      at a variety of steps within the HGF-MET pathway, including MET expression at the
      RNA or protein level, the ligand-receptor interaction, and tyrosine kinase
      function. This paper will review the structure, function, mechanisms of
      tumorigenesis, and potential for therapeutic inhibition of the MET receptor in
      lung cancer and mesothelioma.

TI  - Restriction of Src activity by Cullin-5.
PG  - 157-62
AB  - Src is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that coordinates responses to diverse
      soluble and adhesive signaling molecules and regulates cell proliferation,
      survival, differentiation and migration [1]. Normally, Src activity is tightly
      regulated, and Src-catalyzed phosphorylation is counterbalanced by
      phosphotyrosine phosphatases [2, 3]. However, deregulated mutant Src causes
      malignant transformation when highly expressed [4]. Src transformation is dose
      dependent, but it has been unclear how much mutant Src, compared with endogenous 
      Src, is required for transformation [5]. Here, we show that transformation
      requires highlevel overexpression of mutant src mRNA, in part because active Src 
      protein is degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis [6]. We show that active
      but not inactive Src protein is downregulated depending on the putative tumor
      suppressor and E3 ubiquitin ligase component, Cullin-5 (Cul5). Cul5 removal
      synergizes with physiological levels of mutant src mRNA to increase protein
      tyrosine phosphorylation, induce morphological transformation, and deregulate
      growth. Cul5 also represses Src-induced tumorigenesis and regulates Src signaling
      in normal cells. These results suggest that, when Src is activated by mutation or
      physiological mechanisms, its effects are limited by Cul5, which downregulates
      active Src and its phosphorylated substrates. These findings demonstrate the
      importance of a new mechanism that downregulates Src signaling in cells.

PG  - 453-6
AB  - Cellular signaling networks have evolved to enable swift and accurate responses, 
      even in the face of genetic or environmental perturbation. Thus, genetic screens 
      may not identify all the genes that regulate different biological processes.
      Moreover, although classical screening approaches have succeeded in providing
      parts lists of the essential components of signaling networks, they typically do 
      not provide much insight into the hierarchical and functional relations that
      exist among these components. We describe a high-throughput screen in which we
      used RNA interference to systematically inhibit two genes simultaneously in
      17,724 combinations to identify regulators of Drosophila JUN NH2-terminal kinase 
      (JNK). Using both genetic and phosphoproteomics data, we then implemented an
      integrative network algorithm to construct a JNK phosphorylation network, which
      provides structural and mechanistic insights into the systems architecture of JNK
      signaling.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteome Analysis of Lysophosphatidic Acid Induced Chemotaxis
      applying Dual-step 18O Labeling Coupled with Immobilized Metal-ion Affinity
      Chromatography.
PG  - 4215-24
AB  - Reversible protein phosphorylation is a central cellular regulatory mechanism in 
      modulating protein activity and propagating signals within cellular pathways and 
      networks. Development of more effective methods for the simultaneous
      identification of phosphorylation sites and quantification of temporal changes in
      protein phosphorylation could provide important insights into molecular signaling
      mechanisms in various cellular processes. Here we present an integrated
      quantitative phosphoproteomics approach and its application for comparative
      analysis of Cos-7 cells in response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) gradient
      stimulation. The approach combines trypsin-catalyzed 16O/18O labeling plus
      16O/18O-methanol esterification labeling for quantitation, a macro-Immobilized
      Metal-ion Affinity Chromatography trap for phosphopeptide enrichment, and
      LC-MS/MS analysis. LC separation and MS/MS are followed by neutral loss-dependent
      MS/MS/MS for phosphopeptide identification using a linear ion trap (LTQ)-FT mass 
      spectrometer. A variety of phosphorylated proteins were identified and quantified
      including receptors, kinases, proteins associated with small GTPases, and
      cytoskeleton proteins. A number of hypothetical proteins were also identified as 
      differentially expressed followed by LPA stimulation, and we have shown evidence 
      of pseudopodia subcellular localization of one of these candidate proteins. These
      results demonstrate the efficiency of this quantitative phosphoproteomics
      approach and its application for rapid discovery of phosphorylation events
      associated with LPA gradient sensing and cell chemotaxis.

AB  - Cancer impacts each patient and family differently. Our current understanding of 
      the disease is primarily limited to clinical hallmarks of cancer, but many
      specific molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Genetic markers can be used to
      determine predisposition to tumor development, but molecularly targeted treatment
      strategies that improve patient prognosis are not widely available for most
      cancers. Individualized care plans, also described as personalized medicine,
      still must be developed by understanding and implementing basic science research 
      into clinical treatment. Proteomics holds great promise in contributing to the
      prevention and cure of cancer because it provides unique tools for discovery of
      biomarkers and therapeutic targets. As such, proteomics can help translate basic 
      science discoveries into the clinical practice of personalized medicine. Here we 
      describe how biological mass spectrometry and proteome analysis interact with
      other major patient care and research initiatives and present vignettes
      illustrating efforts in discovery of diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer,
      development of treatment strategies in lung cancer, and monitoring prognosis and 
      relapse in multiple myeloma patients.

TI  - Physiology and pathophysiology of the vasopressin-regulated renal water
      reabsorption.
PG  - 1005-24
AB  - To prevent dehydration, terrestrial animals and humans have developed a sensitive
      and versatile system to maintain their water homeostasis. In states of
      hypernatremia or hypovolemia, the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (AVP) is
      released from the pituitary and binds its type-2 receptor in renal principal
      cells. This triggers an intracellular cAMP signaling cascade, which
      phosphorylates aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and targets the channel to the apical plasma
      membrane. Driven by an osmotic gradient, pro-urinary water then passes the
      membrane through AQP2 and leaves the cell on the basolateral side via AQP3 and
      AQP4 water channels. When water homeostasis is restored, AVP levels decline, and 
      AQP2 is internalized from the plasma membrane, leaving the plasma membrane
      watertight again. The action of AVP is counterbalanced by several hormones like
      prostaglandin E2, bradykinin, dopamine, endothelin-1, acetylcholine, epidermal
      growth factor, and purines. Moreover, AQP2 is strongly involved in the
      pathophysiology of disorders characterized by renal concentrating defects, as
      well as conditions associated with severe water retention. This review focuses on
      our recent increase in understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
      AVP-regulated renal water transport in both health and disease.

TI  - Can Systems Biology Understand Pathway Activation? Gene Expression Signatures as 
      Surrogate Markers for Understanding the Complexity of Pathway Activation.
PG  - 349-60
AB  - Cancer is thought to be caused by a sequence of multiple genetic and epigenetic
      alterations which occur in one or more of the genes controlling cell cycle
      progression and signaling transduction. The complexity of carcinogenic mechanisms
      leads to heterogeneity in molecular phenotype, pathology, and prognosis of
      cancers.Genome-wide mutational analysis of cancer genes in individual tumors is
      the most direct way to elucidate the complex process of disease progression,
      although such high-throughput sequencing technologies are not yet fully
      developed. As a surrogate marker for pathway activation analysis, expression
      profiling using microarrays has been successfully applied for the classification 
      of tumor types, stages of tumor progression, or in some cases, prediction of
      clinical outcomes. However, the biological implication of those gene expression
      signatures is often unclear. Systems biological approaches leverage the signature
      genes as a representation of changes in signaling pathways, instead of
      interpreting the relevance between each gene and phenotype. This approach, which 
      can be achieved by comparing the gene set or the expression profile with those of
      reference experiments in which a defined pathway is modulated, will improve our
      understanding of cancer classification, clinical outcome, and carcinogenesis. In 
      this review, we will discuss recent studies on the development of expression
      signatures to monitor signaling pathway activities and how these signatures can
      be used to improve the identification of responders to anticancer drugs.

PG  - 263-74
AB  - Mass spectrometry has served as a major tool for the discipline of proteomics to 
      catalogue proteins in an unprecedented scale. With chemical and metabolic
      techniques for stable isotope labeling developed over the past decade, it is now 
      routinely used as a method for relative quantification to provide valuable
      information on alteration of protein abundance in a proteome-wide scale. More
      recently, absolute or stoichiometric quantification of proteome is becoming
      feasible, in particular, with the development of strategies with isotope-labeled 
      standards composed of concatenated peptides. On the other hand, remarkable
      progress has been also made in label-free quantification methods based on the
      number of identified peptides. Here we review these mass spectrometry-based
      approaches for absolute quantification of proteome and discuss their
      implications.

TI  - A quantitative study of the recruitment potential of all intracellular tyrosine

PG  - 643-53
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit and process extracellular cues by recruiting
      intracellular signaling proteins to sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. Using
      protein microarrays comprising virtually every human SH2 and PTB domain, we
      generated quantitative protein interaction maps for three well-studied
      receptors—EGFR, FGFR1 and IGF1R—using phosphopeptides derived from every
      intracellular tyrosine residue on each receptor, regardless of whether or not
      they are phosphorylated in vivo. We found that, in general, peptides derived from
      physiological sites of tyrosine phosphorylation bind to substantially more SH2 or
      PTB domains than do peptides derived from nonphysiological sites, supporting the 
      idea that kinases and interaction domains co-evolve and suggesting that new sites
      arise predominantly through selection favoring advantageous interactions, rather 
      than through selection disfavoring unwanted interactions. We also found
      substantial qualitative overlap in the recruitment profiles of these three
      receptors, suggesting that their different biological effects arise, at least in 
      part, from quantitative differences in their affinities for the proteins they
      recruit.

PG  - 2140-50
AB  - Phosphoproteomics, the targeted study of a subfraction of the proteome which is
      modified by phosphorylation, has become an indispensable tool to study cell
      signaling dynamics. We described a methodology that linked phosphoproteome and
      proteome analysis based on Ba2+ binding properties of amino acids. This
      technology selected motif-specific phosphopeptides independent of the system
      under analysis. MudPIT (Multidimensional Identification Technology) identified
      1037 precipitated phosphopeptides from as little as 250µg of proteins. To extend 
      coverage of the phosphoproteome, we sampled the nuclear extract of HeLa cells
      with three values of Ba2+ ions molarity. The presence of more than 70% of
      identified phosphoproteins was further substantiated by their non-modified
      peptides. Upon isoproterenol stimulation of HEK cells, we identified an
      increasing number of phosphoproteins from MAPK cascades and AKAP signaling hubs. 
      We quantified changes in both protein and phosphorylation levels of 197
      phosphoproteins including a critical kinase, MAPK1. Integration of differential
      phosphorylation of MAPK1 with knowledge bases constructed modules that correlated
      well with its role as node in cross-talk of canonical pathways.

TI  - Counteractive Control of Polarized Morphogenesis during Mating by
      Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Fus3 and G1 Cyclin-dependent Kinase.
PG  - 1739-52
AB  - Cell polarization in response to external cues is critical to many eukaryotic
      cells. During pheromone-induced mating in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) Fus3 induces polarization of the actin
      cytoskeleton toward a landmark generated by the pheromone receptor. Here, we
      analyze the role of Fus3 activation and cell cycle arrest in mating
      morphogenesis. The MAPK scaffold Ste5 is initially recruited to the plasma
      membrane in random patches that polarize before shmoo emergence. Polarized
      localization of Ste5 is important for shmooing. In fus3 mutants, Ste5 is
      recruited to significantly more of the plasma membrane, whereas recruitment of
      Bni1 formin, Cdc24 guanine exchange factor, and Ste20 p21-activated protein
      kinase are inhibited. In contrast, polarized recruitment still occurs in a far1
      mutant that is also defective in G1 arrest. Remarkably, loss of Cln2 or Cdc28
      cyclin-dependent kinase restores polarized localization of Bni1, Ste5, and Ste20 
      to a fus3 mutant. These and other findings suggest Fus3 induces polarized growth 
      in G1 phase cells by down-regulating Ste5 recruitment and by inhibiting Cln/Cdc28
      kinase, which prevents basal recruitment of Ste5, Cdc42-mediated asymmetry, and
      mating morphogenesis.

TI  - Proteomics Studies of Brassinosteroid Signal Transduction Using Prefractionation 
      and Two-dimensional DIGE*.
PG  - 728-38
AB  - Signal transduction involves posttranslational modifications and protein-protein 
      interactions, which can be studied by proteomics. In Arabidopsis, the steroid
      hormone (brassinosteroid (BR)) binds to the extracellular domain of a receptor
      kinase (BRI1) to initiate a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascade that
      controls gene expression and plant growth. Here we detected early BR signaling
      events and identified early response proteins using prefractionation and
      two-dimensional (2-D) DIGE. Proteomic changes induced rapidly by BR treatments
      were detected in phosphoprotein and plasma membrane (PM) fractions by 2-D DIGE
      but not in total protein extracts. LC-MS/MS analysis of gel spots identified 19
      BR-regulated PM proteins and six proteins from phosphoprotein fractions. These
      include the BAK1 receptor kinase and BZR1 transcription factor of the BR
      signaling pathway. Both proteins showed spot shifts consistent with BR-regulated 
      phosphorylation. In addition, in vivo phosphorylation sites were identified for
      BZR1, two tetratricopeptide repeat proteins, and a phosphoenolpyruvate
      carboxykinase (PCK1). Overexpression of a novel BR-induced PM protein (DREPP)
      partially suppressed the phenotypes of a BR-deficient mutant, demonstrating its
      important function in BR responses. Our study demonstrates that prefractionation 
      coupled with 2-D DIGE is a powerful approach for studying signal transduction.

TI  - Dissection of the insulin signaling pathway via quantitative phosphoproteomics.
PG  - 2451-6
AB  - The insulin signaling pathway is of pivotal importance in metabolic diseases,
      such as diabetes, and in cellular processes, such as aging. Insulin activates a
      tyrosine phosphorylation cascade that branches to create a complex network
      affecting multiple biological processes. To understand the full spectrum of the
      tyrosine phosphorylation cascade, we have defined the tyrosine-phosphoproteome of
      the insulin signaling pathway, using high resolution mass spectrometry in
      combination with phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation and stable isotope labeling 
      by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in differentiated brown adipocytes. Of 40 
      identified insulin-induced effectors, 7 have not previously been described in
      insulin signaling, including SDR, PKCδ binding protein, LRP-6, and PISP/PDZK11, a
      potential calcium ATPase binding protein. A proteomic interaction screen with
      PISP/PDZK11 identified the calcium transporting ATPase SERCA2, supporting a
      connection to calcium signaling. The combination of quantitative
      phosphoproteomics with cell culture models provides a powerful strategy to
      dissect the insulin signaling pathways in intact cells.

TI  - A novel phosphoprotein analysis scheme for assessing changes in premalignant and 
      malignant breast cell lines using 2D liquid separations, protein microarrays and 
      tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 51-66
AB  - An analysis of phosphorylation changes that occur during cancer progression would
      provide insights into the molecular pathways responsible for a malignant
      phenotype. In this study we employed a novel coupling of 2D-liquid separations
      and protein microarray technology to reveal changes in phosphoprotein status
      between premalignant (AT1) and malignant (CA1a) cell lines derived from the human
      MCF10A breast cell lines. Intact proteins were first separated according to their
      isoelectric point and hydrophobicities, then arrayed on SuperAmine glass slides. 
      Phosphoproteins were detected using the universal, inorganic phospho-sensor dye, 
      ProQ Diamond. Using this dye, out of 140 spots that were positive for
      phosphorylation, a total of 85 differentially expressed spots were detected over 
      a pH range of 7.2 to 4.0. Proteins were identified and their peptides sequenced
      by mass spectrometry. The strategy enabled the identification of 75
      differentially expressed phosphoproteins, from which 51 phosphorylation sites in 
      27 unique proteins were confirmed. Interestingly, the majority of differentially 
      expressed phosphorylated proteins observed were nuclear proteins. Three
      regulators of apoptosis, Bad, Bax and Acinus, were also differentially
      phosphorylated in the two cell lines. Further development of this strategy will
      facilitate an understanding of the mechanisms involved in malignancy progression 
      and other disease-related phenotypes.

TI  - DLC-1:a Rho GTPase-activating protein and tumour suppressor.
PG  - 1185-207
AB  - The deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC-1) gene encodes a GTPase activating protein
      that acts as a negative regulator of the Rho family of small GTPases. Rho
      proteins transduce signals that influence cell morphology and physiology, and
      their aberrant up-regulation is a key factor in the neoplastic process, including
      metastasis. Since its discovery, compelling evidence has accumulated that
      demonstrates a role for DLC-1 as a bona fide tumour suppressor gene in different 
      types of human cancer. Loss of DLC-1 expression mediated by genetic and
      epigenetic mechanisms has been associated with the development of many human
      cancers, and restoration of DLC-1 expression inhibited the growth of tumour cells
      in vivo and in vitro. Two closely related genes, DLC-2 and DLC-3, may also be
      tumour suppressors. This review presents the current status of progress in
      understanding the biological functions of DLC-1 and its relatives and their roles
      in neoplasia.

TI  - Downstream signalling and specific inhibition of c-MET/HGF pathway in small cell 
      lung cancer: implications for tumour invasion.
PG  - 368-77
AB  - The c-MET receptor can be overexpressed, amplified, or mutated in solid tumours
      including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In c-MET-overexpressing SCLC cell line
      NCI-H69, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) dramatically induced c-MET
      phosphorylation at phosphoepitopes pY1230/1234/1235 (catalytic tyrosine kinase), 
      pY1003 (juxtamembrane), and also of paxillin at pY31 (CRKL-binding site). We
      utilised a global proteomics phosphoantibody array approach to identify further
      c-MET/HGF signal transduction intermediates in SCLC. Strong HGF induction of
      specific phosphorylation sites in phosphoproteins involved in c-MET/HGF signal
      transduction was detected, namely adducin-α [S724], adducin-γ [S662], CREB
      [S133], ERK1 [T185/Y187], ERK1/2 [T202/Y204], ERK2 [T185/Y187], MAPKK (MEK) 1/2
      [S221/S225], MAPKK (MEK) 3/6 [S189/S207], RB [S612], RB1 [S780], JNK [T183/Y185],
      STAT3 [S727], focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [Y576/S722/S910], p38α-MAPK
      [T180/Y182], and AKT1[S473] and [T308]. Conversely, inhibition of phosphorylation
      by HGF in protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase R (PKR), and also CDK1 was
      identified. Phosphoantibody-based immunohistochemical analysis of SCLC tumour
      tissue and microarray established the role of c-MET in SCLC biology. This
      supports a role of c-MET activation in tumour invasive front in the tumour
      progression and invasion involving FAK and AKT downstream. The c-MET serves as an
      attractive therapeutic target in SCLC, as shown through small interfering RNA
      (siRNA) and selective prototype c-MET inhibitor SU11274, inhibiting the
      phosphorylation of c-MET itself and its downstream molecules such as AKT, S6
      kinase, and ERK1/2. Investigation of mechanisms of invasion and, ultimately,
      metastasis in SCLC would be very useful with these signal transduction molecules.

TI  - Profiling signaling polarity in chemotactic cells.
PG  - 8328-33
AB  - Cell movement requires morphological polarization characterized by formation of a
      leading pseudopodium (PD) at the front and a trailing rear at the back. However, 
      little is known about how protein networks are spatially integrated to regulate
      this process at the system level. Here, we apply global proteome profiling in
      combination with newly developed quantitative phosphoproteomics approaches for
      comparative analysis of the cell body (CB) and PD proteome of chemotactic cells. 
      The spatial relationship of 3,509 proteins and 228 distinct sites of
      phosphorylation were mapped revealing networks of signaling proteins that
      partition to the PD and/or the CB compartments. The major network represented in 
      the PD includes integrin signaling, actin regulatory, and axon guidance proteins,
      whereas the CB consists of DNA/RNA metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and
      structural maintenance. Our findings provide insight into the spatial
      organization of signaling networks that control cell movement and provide a
      comprehensive system-wide profile of proteins and phosphorylation sites that
      control cell polarization.

TI  - The RNA-Binding Protein KSRP Promotes Decay of β-Catenin mRNA and Is Inactivated 
      by PI3K-AKT Signaling.
LID - e5
AB  - β-catenin plays an essential role in several biological events including cell
      fate determination, cell proliferation, and transformation. Here we report that
      β-catenin is encoded by a labile transcript whose half-life is prolonged by Wnt
      and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–AKT signaling. AKT phosphorylates the mRNA
      decay-promoting factor KSRP at a unique serine residue, induces its association
      with the multifunctional protein 14-3-3, and prevents KSRP interaction with the
      exoribonucleolytic complex exosome. This impairs KSRP's ability to promote rapid 
      mRNA decay. Our results uncover an unanticipated level of control of β-catenin
      expression pointing to KSRP as a required factor to ensure rapid degradation of
      β-catenin in unstimulated cells. We propose KSRP phosphorylation as a link
      between phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–AKT signaling and β-catenin accumulation.

TI  - LC-MS/MS Analysis of Apical and Basolateral Plasma Membranes of Rat Renal
      Collecting Duct Cells*†.
PG  - 2131-45
AB  - We used biotinylation and streptavidin affinity chromatography to label and
      enrich proteins from apical and basolateral membranes of rat kidney inner
      medullary collecting ducts (IMCDs) prior to LC-MS/MS protein identification. To
      enrich apical membrane proteins and bound peripheral membrane proteins, IMCDs
      were perfusion-labeled with primary amine-reactive biotinylation reagents at 2 °C
      using a double barreled pipette. The perfusion-biotinylated proteins and proteins
      bound to them were isolated with CaptAvidin-agarose beads, separated with
      SDS-PAGE, and sliced into continuous gel pieces for LC-MS/MS protein
      identification (LTQ, Thermo Electron Corp.). 17 integral and
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane proteins and 44 non-integral
      membrane proteins were identified. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy
      confirmed ACVRL1, H+/K+-ATPase α1, NHE2, and TauT expression in the IMCDs.
      Basement membrane and basolateral membrane proteins were biotinylated via
      incubation of IMCD suspensions with biotinylation reagents on ice. 23 integral
      and GPI-linked membrane proteins and 134 non-integral membrane proteins were
      identified. Analyses of non-integral membrane proteins preferentially identified 
      in the perfusion-biotinylated and not in the incubation-biotinylated IMCDs
      revealed protein kinases, scaffold proteins, SNARE proteins, motor proteins,
      small GTP-binding proteins, and related proteins that may be involved in
      vasopressin-stimulated AQP2, UT-A1, and ENaC regulation. A World Wide
      Web-accessible database was constructed of 222 membrane proteins (integral and
      GPI-linked) from this study and prior studies.

TI  - Cox-2 is regulated by toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) signaling and is important for 
      proliferation and apoptosis in response to intestinal mucosal injury.
PG  - 862-77
AB  - Background: We have recently demonstrated that mice deficient in TLR4 or its
      adapter molecule MyD88 have increased signs of colitis compared to wild-type (WT)
      mice following dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced injury. We wished to test the
      hypothesis that Cox-2 derived PGE2 is important in TLR4-related mucosal repair.
      Methods: Cox-2 expression was analyzed by real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry,
      western blotting, and luciferase reporter constructs. siRNA was used to inhibit
      expression of MyD88. TLR4−/− or WT mice were given 2.5% DSS for 7 days.
      Proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using BrdU staining and TUNEL assays,
      respectively. PGE2 was given orally to DSS-treated mice. Results: Intestinal
      epithelial cell lines upregulated Cox-2 expression in a TLR4- and MyD88-dependent
      fashion. LPS-mediated stimulation of PGE2 production was blocked by a selective
      Cox-2 inhibitor or siRNA against MyD88. Following DSS injury, Cox-2 expression
      increased only in WT mice. TLR4−/− mice have significantly reduced proliferation 
      and increased apoptosis following DSS injury compared to WT mice. PGE2
      supplementation of TLR4−/− mice resulted in improvement in clinical signs of
      colitis and restoration of proliferation and apoptosis to wild-type values. The
      mechanism for improved epithelial repair may be through PGE2-dependent activation
      of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Conclusion: We describe an important
      link between TLR4 signaling and Cox-2 expression in the gut. TLR4 and MyD88
      signaling are required for optimal proliferation and protection against apoptosis
      in the injured intestine. Although TLR4 signaling is beneficial in the
      short-term, chronic signaling through TLR4 may lower the threshold for
      colitis-associated cancer.

TI  - Quantitative phosphoproteomics of vasopressin-sensitive renal cells: Regulation
      of aquaporin-2 phosphorylation at two sites.
PG  - 7159-64
AB  - Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in vasopressin signaling in the
      renal-collecting duct. Large-scale identification and quantification of
      phosphorylation events triggered by vasopressin is desirable to gain a
      comprehensive systems-level understanding of this process. We carried out
      phosphoproteomic analysis of rat inner medullary collecting duct cells by using a
      combination of phosphopeptide enrichment by immobilized metal affinity
      chromatography and phosphorylation site identification by liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometryn neutral loss scanning. A total of 714
      phosphorylation sites on 223 unique phosphoproteins were identified from inner
      medullary collecting duct samples treated short-term with either calyculin A or
      vasopressin. A number of proteins involved in cytoskeletal reorganization,
      vesicle trafficking, and transcriptional regulation were identified. Previously
      unidentified phosphorylation sites were found for membrane proteins essential to 
      collecting duct physiology, including eight sites among aquaporin-2 (AQP2),
      aquaporin-4, and urea transporter isoforms A1 and A3. Through label-free
      quantification of phosphopeptides, we identified a number of proteins that
      significantly changed phosphorylation state in response to short-term vasopressin
      treatment: AQP2, Bclaf1, LRRC47, Rgl3, and SAFB2. In the presence of vasopressin,
      AQP2 monophosphorylated at S256 and diphosphorylated AQP2 (pS256/261) increased
      in abundance, whereas AQP2 monophosphorylated at S261 decreased, raising the
      possibility that both sites are involved in vasopressin-dependent AQP2
      trafficking. This study reveals the practicality of liquid chromotography-mass
      spectrometryn neutral loss scanning for large-scale identification and
      quantification of protein phosphorylation in the analysis of cell signaling in a 
      native mammalian system.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphotyrosine Proteomics of EphB2 Signaling by Stable Isotope
      Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC).
PG  - 581-8
AB  - Eph-related receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) have been implicated in several
      biological functions including synaptic plasticity, axon guidance and
      morphogenesis, yet the details of the signal transduction pathways that produce
      these specific biological functions after ligand-receptor interaction remain
      unclear. We used Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC)
      in combination with LC-MS/MS to characterize cellular signaling following
      stimulation by ephrinB1-Fc of NG-108 cells that overexpress EphB2 receptors.
      Because tyrosine phosphorylation functions as a key regulatory event in RTK
      signaling, we used anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation (pY IP) of cell
      lysates to isolate potential participants in the EphB2 pathway. Our SILAC
      experiments identified 127 unique proteins, 40 of which demonstrated increased
      abundance in pY IPs from ephrinB1-Fc stimulated cells as compared with
      unstimulated cells. Six proteins demonstrated decreased abundance, and 81 did not
      change significantly in relative abundance. Western blotting analysis of five
      proteins after pY IP verified their SILAC results. Based on previously published 
      work and use of PathwayAssist™ software, we proposed an interaction network
      downstream of EphB2 for the proteins with changed ratios.

TI  - Phosphoproteomics reveals extensive in vivo phosphorylation of Arabidopsis
      proteins involved in RNA metabolism.
PG  - 3267-78
AB  - Most regulatory pathways are governed by the reversible phosphorylation of
      proteins. Recent developments in mass spectrometry-based technology allow the
      large-scale analysis of protein phosphorylation. Here, we show the application of
      immobilized metal affinity chromatography to purify phosphopeptides from
      Arabidopsis extracts. Phosphopeptide sequences were identified by liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS/MS). A total of 79 unique
      phosphorylation sites were determined in 22 phosphoproteins with a putative role 
      in RNA metabolism, including splicing of mRNAs. Among these phosphoproteins, 12
      Ser/Arg-rich (SR) splicing factors were identified. A conserved phosphorylation
      site was found in most of the phosphoproteins, including the SR proteins,
      suggesting that these proteins are targeted by the same or a highly related
      protein kinase. To test this hypothesis, Arabidopsis SR protein-specific kinase 4
      (SRPK4) that was initially identified as an interactor of SR proteins was tested 
      for its ability to phosphorylate the SR protein RSp31. In vitro kinase assays
      showed that all in vivo phosphorylation sites of RSp31 were targeted by SRPK4.
      These data suggest that the plant mRNA splicing machinery is a major target of
      phosphorylation and that a considerable number of proteins involved in RNA
      metabolism may be targeted by SRPKs.

PG  - 348-65
AB  - Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic sites for the majority of excitatory
      synapses in the mammalian forebrain. While many spines display great stability,
      others change shape in a matter of seconds to minutes. These rapid alterations in
      dendritic spine number and size require tight control of the actin cytoskeleton, 
      the main structural component of dendritic spines. The ability of neurons to
      alter spine number and size is essential for the expression of neuronal
      plasticity. Within spines, guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) act as
      critical regulators of the actin cytoskeleton by controlling the activity of
      Rho-GTPases. In this review, we focus on the Rho-GEFs expressed in the nucleus
      accumbens and localized to the postsynaptic density and, thus, positioned to
      effect rapid alterations in the structure of dendritic spines. We review
      literature that ties these GEFs to different receptor systems and intracellular
      signaling cascades and discuss the effects these interactions are likely to have 
      on synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have
      shown dramatic effects against that tumors harboring EGFR activating mutations in
      the EGFR intracytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain and resulted in cell apoptosis. 
      Unfortunately, a number of patients ultimately developed resistance by multiple
      mechanisms. Thus, elucidation of the mechanism of resistance to EGFR-TKIs can
      provide strategies for blocking or reversing the situation. Recent studies
      suggested that redundant kinase activation plays pivotal roles in escaping from
      the effects of EGFR-TKIs. Herein, we aimed to characterize several molecular
      events involved in the resistance to EGFR-TKIs mediated by redundant kinase
      activation.

TI  - Oncogenic signaling by tyrosine kinases of the SRC family in advanced colorectal 
      cancer.
PG  - 357-71
AB  - The non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the SRC family (SFK) play important roles in
      signal transduction induced by a large variety of extracellular stimuli,
      including growth factors and Integrins. When deregulated, SFKs show oncogenic
      activity, as originally reported for v-Src, the transforming product of the avian
      retrovirus RSV, and then, in many human cancers, particularly colorectal cancer
      (CRC). In CRC, SFK deregulation largely occurs in the absence of mutations of the
      corresponding genes, but the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are still
      unclear. In addition to a role in early tumor progression, SFK deregulation may
      also be important in advanced CRC, as suggested by the association between
      increased SFK activity and poor clinical outcome. However, SFK contribution to
      CRC metastasis formation is still poorly documented. Here, we will review recent 
      findings that broaden our understanding of the mechanisms underlying SFK
      deregulation and signaling in advanced CRC. We will also discuss the implication 
      of these observations for SFK-based therapy in metastatic CRC.

PG  - 274-92
AB  - Cardioproteomics (Cardiovascular proteomics) is fast becoming an indispensible
      technique in deciphering changes in signaling pathways that occur in
      cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The quality and availability of the instruments
      and bioinformatics software used for cardioproteomics continues to improve, and
      these techniques are now available to most cardiovascular researchers either
      directly or indirectly via university core centers. The heart and aorta are
      specialized tissues which present unique challenges to investigate. Currently,
      the diverse range of proteomic techniques available for cardiovascular research
      makes the choice of the best method or best combination of methods for the
      disease parameter(s) being investigated as important as the equipment used. This 
      review focuses on proteomic techniques and their applications which have advanced
      our understanding of the signaling mechanisms involved in CVDs at the levels of
      protein complex/protein-protein interaction, post-translational modifications and
      signaling induced protein changes.

TI  - Evolutionary patterns of phosphorylated serines.
PG  - 8
AB  - : Posttranslationally modified amino acids are chemically distinct types of amino
      acids and in terms of evolution they might behave differently from their
      non-modified counterparts. In order to check this possibility, we reconstructed
      the evolutionary history of phosphorylated serines in several groups of
      organisms. Comparisons of substitution vectors have revealed some significant
      differences in the evolution of modified and corresponding non-modified amino
      acids. In particular, phosphoserines are more frequently substituted to aspartate
      and glutamate, compared to non-phosphorylated serines. Reviewers: This article
      was reviewed by Arcady Mushegian and Sandor Pongor.

TI  - A novel mass spectrometry-based assay for GSK-3β activity.
PG  - 29
AB  - Background: As a component of the progression from genomic to proteomic analysis,
      there is a need for accurate assessment of protein post-translational
      modifications such as phosphorylation. Traditional kinase assays rely heavily on 
      the incorporation of γ-P32 radiolabeled isotopes, monoclonal anti-phospho-protein
      antibodies, or gel shift analysis of substrate proteins. In addition to the
      expensive and time consuming nature of these methods, the use of radio-ligands
      imposes restrictions based on the half-life of the radionucleotides and pose
      potential health risks to researchers. With the shortcomings of traditional
      assays in mind, the aim of this study was to develop a high throughput,
      non-radioactive kinase assay for screening Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta
      (GSK-3β) activity. Results: Synthetic peptide substrates designed with a GSK-3β
      phosphorylation site were assayed with both recombinant enzyme and GSK-3β
      immunoprecipitated from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. A molecular weight shift equal to
      that of a single phosphate group (80 Da.) was detected by surface enhanced laser 
      desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) in a GSK-3β
      target peptide (2B-Sp). Not only was there a dose-dependent response in molecular
      weight shift to the amount of recombinant GSK-3β used in this assay, this shift
      was also inhibited by lithium chloride (LiCl), in a dose-dependent manner.
      Conclusion: We present here a novel method to sensitively measure peptide
      phosphorylation by GSK-3β that, due to the incorporation of substrate controls,
      is applicable to either purified enzyme or cell extracts. Future studies using
      this method have the potential to elucidate the activity of GSK-3β in vivo, and
      to screen enzyme activity in relation to a variety of GSK-3β related disorders.

TI  - PKC isoforms interact with and phosphorylate DNMT1.
PG  - 31
AB  - Background: DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) has been shown to be phosphorylated
      on multiple serine and threonine residues, based on cell type and physiological
      conditions. Although recent studies have suggested that protein kinase C (PKC)
      may be involved, the individual contribution of PKC isoforms in their ability to 
      phosphorylate DNMT1 remains unknown. The PKC family consists of at least 12
      isoforms that possess distinct differences in structure, substrate requirement,
      expression and localization. Results: Here we show that PKCα, βI, βII, δ, γ, η, ζ
      and μ preferentially phosphorylate the N-terminal domain of human DNMT1. No such 
      phosphorylation of DNMT1 was observed with PKCε. Using PKCζ as a prototype model,
      we also found that PKC physically interacts with and phosphorylates DNMT1. In
      vitro phosphorylation assays conducted with recombinant fragments of DNMT1 showed
      that PKCζ preferentially phosphorylated the N-terminal region of DNMT1. The
      interaction of PKCζ with DNMT1 was confirmed by GST pull-down and
      co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Co-localization experiments by fluorescent
      microscopy further showed that endogenous PKCζ and DNMT1 were present in the same
      molecular complex. Endogenous PKCζ activity was also detected when DNMT1 was
      immunoprecipitated from HEK-293 cells. Overexpression of both PKCζ and DNMT1 in
      HEK-293 cells, but not of either alone, reduced the methylation status of genes
      distributed across the genome. Moreover, in vitro phosphorylation of DNMT1 by
      PKCζ reduced its methytransferase activity. Conclusions: Our results indicate
      that phosphorylation of human DNMT1 by PKC is isoform-specific and provides the
      first evidence of cooperation between PKCζ and DNMT1 in the control of the DNA
      methylation patterns of the genome.

TI  - Identification of novel signaling components in N,N’-Dinitrosopiperazine-mediated
      metastasis of nasopharyngeal Carcinoma by quantitative phosphoproteomics.
PG  - 243
AB  - Background: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a highly invasive and metastatic
      cancer. N,N’-dinitrosopiperazine (DNP), a carcinogen with specificity for
      nasopharyngeal epithelium, facilitates NPC metastasis. However, the underlying
      mechanism is not known. Methods: Quantitative phosphoproteomics, using stable
      isotope labeling of amino acids in cell cultures, was employed to identify
      phosphoproteins associated with NPC metastasis mediated by DNP. NPC cell line
      6-10B, which is relatively less metastatic, was used to investigate DNP-mediated 
      metastasis. Boyden chamber invasion assay was used to measure DNP-induced
      motility and invasion, and nude mice were used to verify DNP-mediated metastasis 
      in vivo. Several different phosphoproteins detected by proteomics analysis were
      verified by immunoblotting. DNP-mediated metastasis facilitated by lysine-rich
      CEACAM1 co-isolated protein (LYRIC) phosphorylation at serine 568 was confirmed
      using mutations targeting the phosphorylation site of LYRIC. DNP-mediated
      metastasis through LYRIC phosphorylation was confirmed in the NPC cell line CNE1.
      DNP-mediated LYRIC phosphorylation at serine 568 was also verified in metastatic 
      tumors of BABL/c nude mice. Results: Boyden chamber invasion assay indicated that
      DNP mediated cell motility and invasion of NPC cell 6-10B in vitro, and
      experiments with nude mice indicated that DNP increased 6-10B metastasis in vivo.
      In the phosphoproteomics analysis, we detected 216 phosphorylation sites on 130
      proteins; among these, 48 phosphorylation sites on 30 unique phosphopeptides were
      modulated by DNP by at least 1.5-fold. DNP mediated the expression of
      phosphorylated GTPase, ferritin, LYRIC, and RNA polymerase, and it decreased the 
      expression of phosphorylated torsin-1A protein 1. Furthermore, DNP induced LYRIC 
      phosphorylation at serine 568 to facilitate cell motility and invasion, whereas
      DNP-mediated motility and invasion was decreased when serine 568 in LYRIC was
      mutated. In another NPC cell line, CNE1, DNP also mediated cell motility and
      invasion followed by enhanced phosphorylation of LYRIC at serine 568. Finally,
      phosphorylated-LYRIC expression at serine 568 was significantly increased in
      metastatic tumors induced by DNP. Conclusion: DNP regulates multiple signaling
      pathways through protein phosphorylation, including the phosphorylation of LYRIC 
      at serine 568, and mediates NPC metastasis. These findings provide insights on
      the complexity and dynamics of DNP-facilitated metastasis, and may help to gain a
      better understanding of the mechanisms by clarifying NPC-induced metastasis.

TI  - New insights in osteogenic differentiation revealed by mass spectrometric
      assessment of phosphorylated substrates in murine skin mesenchymal cells.
PG  - 47
AB  - Background: Bone fractures and loss represent significant costs for the public
      health system and often affect the patients quality of life, therefore,
      understanding the molecular basis for bone regeneration is essential. Cytokines, 
      such as IL-6, IL-10 and TNFα, secreted by inflammatory cells at the lesion site, 
      at the very beginning of the repair process, act as chemotactic factors for
      mesenchymal stem cells, which proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts
      through the autocrine and paracrine action of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs),
      mainly BMP-2. Although it is known that BMP-2 binds to ActRI/BMPR and activates
      the SMAD 1/5/8 downstream effectors, little is known about the intracellular
      mechanisms participating in osteoblastic differentiation. We assessed differences
      in the phosphorylation status of different cellular proteins upon BMP-2
      osteogenic induction of isolated murine skin mesenchymal stem cells using Triplex
      Stable Isotope Dimethyl Labeling coupled with LC/MS. Results: From 150 μg of
      starting material, 2,264 proteins were identified and quantified at five
      different time points, 235 of which are differentially phosphorylated. Kinase
      motif analysis showed that several substrates display phosphorylation sites for
      Casein Kinase, p38, CDK and JNK. Gene ontology analysis showed an increase in
      biological processes related with signaling and differentiation at early time
      points after BMP2 induction. Moreover, proteins involved in cytoskeleton
      rearrangement, Wnt and Ras pathways were found to be differentially
      phosphorylated during all timepoints studied. Conclusions: Taken together, these 
      data, allow new insights on the intracellular substrates which are phosphorylated
      early on during differentiation to BMP2-driven osteoblastic differentiation of
      skin-derived mesenchymal stem cells.

TI  - Unraveling incompatibility between wheat and the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria
      tritici through apoplastic proteomics.
LID - 362
AB  - Background: Hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici causes severe
      foliar disease in wheat. However, current knowledge of molecular mechanisms
      involved in plant resistance to Z. tritici and Z. tritici virulence factors is
      far from being complete. The present work investigated the proteome of leaf
      apoplastic fluid with emphasis on both host wheat and Z. tritici during the
      compatible and incompatible interactions. Results: The proteomics analysis
      revealed rapid host responses to the biotrophic growth, including enhanced
      carbohydrate metabolism, apoplastic defenses and stress, and cell wall
      reinforcement, might contribute to resistance. Compatibility between the host and
      the pathogen was associated with inactivated plant apoplastic responses as well
      as fungal defenses to oxidative stress and perturbation of plant cell wall during
      the initial biotrophic stage, followed by the strong induction of plant defenses 
      during the necrotrophic stage. To study the role of anti-oxidative stress in Z.
      tritici pathogenicity in depth, a YAP1 transcription factor regulating
      antioxidant expression was deleted and showed the contribution to anti-oxidative 
      stress in Z. tritici, but was not required for pathogenicity. This result
      suggests the functional redundancy of antioxidants in the fungus. Conclusions:
      The data demonstrate that incompatibility is probably resulted from the
      proteome-level activation of host apoplastic defenses as well as fungal
      incapability to adapt to stress and interfere with host cell at the biotrophic
      stage of the interaction. Electronic supplementary material: The online version

TI  - Quantitative phosphoproteomic profiling of fiber differentiation and initiation
      in a fiberless mutant of cotton.
LID - 466
AB  - Background: The cotton (Gossypium spp.) fiber cell is an important unicellular
      model for studying cell differentiation. There is evidence suggesting that
      phosphorylation is a critical post-translational modification involved in
      regulation of a wide range of cell activities. Nevertheless, the sites of
      phosphorylation in G. hirsutum and their regulatory roles in fiber cell
      initiation are largely unknown. In this study, we employed a mass
      spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics to conduct a global and site-specific
      phosphoproteome profiling between ovules of a fuzzless-lintless (fl) Upland
      cotton (G. hirsutum) mutant and its isogenic parental wild type (WT) at -3 and
      0 days post-anthesis (DPA). Results: A total of 830 phosphopeptides and 1,592
      phosphorylation sites from 619 phosphoproteins were identified by iTRAQ (isobaric
      tags for relative and absolute quantitation). Of these, 76 phosphoproteins and
      1,100 phosphorylation sites were identified for the first time after searching
      the P3DB public database using the BLAST program. Among the detected
      phosphopeptides, 69 were differentially expressed between the fl mutant and its
      WT in ovules at -3 and 0 DPA. An analysis using the Motif-X program uncovered 19 
      phosphorylation motifs, 8 of which were unique to cotton. A further metabolic
      pathway analysis revealed that the differentially phosphorylated proteins were
      involved in signal transduction, protein modification, carbohydrate metabolic
      processes, and cell cycle and cell proliferation. Conclusions: Our
      phosphoproteomics-based research provides the first global overview of
      phosphorylation during cotton fiber initiation, and also offers a helpful dataset
      for elucidation of signaling networks in fiber development of G. hirsutum.

TI  - Discovering pathway cross-talks based on functional relations between pathways.
PG  - S25
AB  - Background: In biological systems, pathways coordinate or interact with one
      another to achieve a complex biological process. Studying how they influence each
      other is essential for understanding the intricacies of a biological system.
      However, current methods rely on statistical tests to determine pathway
      relations, and may lose numerous biologically significant relations. Results:
      This study proposes a method that identifies the pathway relations by measuring
      the functional relations between pathways based on the Gene Ontology (GO)
      annotations. This approach identified 4,661 pathway relations among 166 pathways 
      from Pathway Interaction Database (PID). Using 143 pathway interactions from PID 
      as testing data, the function-based approach (FBA) is able to identify 93% of
      pathway interactions, better than the existing methods based on the shared
      components and protein-protein interactions. Many well-known pathway cross-talks 
      are only identified by FBA. In addition, the false positive rate of FBA is
      significantly lower than others via pathway co-expression analysis. Conclusions: 
      This function-based approach appears to be more sensitive and able to infer more 
      biologically significant and explainable pathway relations.

TI  - Multiple platform assessment of the EGF dependent transcriptome by microarray and
      deep tag sequencing analysis.
PG  - 326
AB  - Background: Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a key regulatory growth factor
      activating many processes relevant to normal development and disease, affecting
      cell proliferation and survival. Here we use a combined approach to study the EGF
      dependent transcriptome of HeLa cells by using multiple long oligonucleotide
      based microarray platforms (from Agilent, Operon, and Illumina) in combination
      with digital gene expression profiling (DGE) with the Illumina Genome Analyzer.
      Results: By applying a procedure for cross-platform data meta-analysis based on
      RankProd and GlobalAncova tests, we establish a well validated gene set with
      transcript levels altered after EGF treatment. We use this robust gene list to
      build higher order networks of gene interaction by interconnecting associated
      networks, supporting and extending the important role of the EGF signaling
      pathway in cancer. In addition, we find an entirely new set of genes previously
      unrelated to the currently accepted EGF associated cellular functions.
      Conclusions: We propose that the use of global genomic cross-validation derived
      from high content technologies (microarrays or deep sequencing) can be used to
      generate more reliable datasets. This approach should help to improve the
      confidence of downstream in silico functional inference analyses based on high
      content data.

TI  - Causal reasoning identifies mechanisms of sensitivity for a novel AKT kinase
      inhibitor, GSK690693.
PG  - 419
AB  - Background: Inappropriate activation of AKT signaling is a relatively common
      occurrence in human tumors, and can be caused by activation of components of, or 
      by loss or decreased activity of inhibitors of, this signaling pathway. A novel, 
      pan AKT kinase inhibitor, GSK690693, was developed in order to interfere with the
      inappropriate AKT signaling seen in these human malignancies. Causal network
      modeling is a systematic computational analysis that identifies upstream changes 
      in gene regulation that can serve as explanations for observed changes in gene
      expression. In this study, causal network modeling is employed to elucidate
      mechanisms of action of GSK690693 that contribute to its observed biological
      effects. The mechanism of action of GSK690693 was evaluated in multiple human
      tumor cell lines from different tissues in 2-D cultures and xenografts using RNA 
      expression and phosphoproteomics data. Understanding the molecular mechanism of
      action of novel targeted agents can enhance our understanding of various
      biological processes regulated by the intended target and facilitate their
      clinical development. Results: Causal network modeling on transcriptomic and
      proteomic data identified molecular networks that are comprised of activated or
      inhibited mechanisms that could explain observed changes in the sensitive cell
      lines treated with GSK690693. Four networks common to all cell lines and
      xenografts tested were identified linking GSK690693 inhibition of AKT kinase
      activity to decreased proliferation. These networks included increased RB1
      activity, decreased MYC activity, decreased TFRC activity, and increased
      FOXO1/FOXO3 activity. Conclusion: AKT is involved in regulating both cell
      proliferation and apoptotic pathways; however, the primary effect with GSK690693 
      appears to be anti-proliferative in the cell lines and xenografts evaluated.
      Furthermore, these results indicate that anti-proliferative responses to
      GSK690693 in either 2-D culture or xenograft models may share common mechanisms
      within and across sensitive cell lines.

TI  - Expression-based and co-localization detection of arabinogalactan protein 6 and
      arabinogalactan protein 11 interactors in Arabidopsis pollen and pollen tubes.
PG  - 7
AB  - Background: Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are cell wall proteoglycans that have
      been shown to be important for pollen development. An Arabidopsis double null
      mutant for two pollen-specific AGPs (agp6 agp11) showed reduced pollen tube
      growth and compromised response to germination cues in vivo. A microarray
      experiment was performed on agp6 agp11 pollen tubes to search for genetic
      interactions in the context of pollen tube growth. A yeast two-hybrid experiment 
      for AGP6 and AGP11 was also designed. Results: The lack of two specific AGPs
      induced a meaningful shift in the gene expression profile. In fact, a high number
      of genes showed altered expression levels, strengthening the case that AGP6 and
      AGP11 are involved in complex phenomena. The expression levels of calcium- and
      signaling-related genes were found to be altered, supporting the known roles of
      the respective proteins in pollen tube growth. Although the precise nature of the
      proposed interactions needs further investigation, the putative involvement of
      AGPs in signaling cascades through calmodulin and protein degradation via
      ubiquitin was indicated. The expression of stress-, as well as signaling-
      related, genes was also changed; a correlation that may result from the
      recognized similarities between signaling pathways in both defense and pollen
      tube growth.The results of yeast two-hybrid experiments lent further support to
      these signaling pathways and revealed putative AGP6 and AGP11 interactors
      implicated in recycling of cell membrane components via endocytosis, through
      clathrin-mediated endosomes and multivesicular bodies. Conclusions: The data
      presented suggest the involvement of AGP6 and AGP11 in multiple signaling
      pathways, in particular those involved in developmental processes such as
      endocytosis-mediated plasma membrane remodeling during Arabidopsis pollen
      development. This highlights the importance of endosomal trafficking pathways
      which are rapidly emerging as fundamental regulators of the wall physiology.

TI  - Specification, annotation, visualization and simulation of a large rule-based
      model for ERBB receptor signaling.
PG  - 107
AB  - Background: Mathematical/computational models are needed to understand cell
      signaling networks, which are complex. Signaling proteins contain multiple
      functional components and multiple sites of post-translational modification. The 
      multiplicity of components and sites of modification ensures that interactions
      among signaling proteins have the potential to generate myriad protein complexes 
      and post-translational modification states. As a result, the number of chemical
      species that can be populated in a cell signaling network, and hence the number
      of equations in an ordinary differential equation model required to capture the
      dynamics of these species, is prohibitively large. To overcome this problem, the 
      rule-based modeling approach has been developed for representing interactions
      within signaling networks efficiently and compactly through coarse-graining of
      the chemical kinetics of molecular interactions. Results: Here, we provide a
      demonstration that the rule-based modeling approach can be used to specify and
      simulate a large model for ERBB receptor signaling that accounts for
      site-specific details of protein-protein interactions. The model is considered
      large because it corresponds to a reaction network containing more reactions than
      can be practically enumerated. The model encompasses activation of ERK and Akt,
      and it can be simulated using a network-free simulator, such as NFsim, to
      generate time courses of phosphorylation for 55 individual serine, threonine, and
      tyrosine residues. The model is annotated and visualized in the form of an
      extended contact map. Conclusions: With the development of software that
      implements novel computational methods for calculating the dynamics of
      large-scale rule-based representations of cellular signaling networks, it is now 
      possible to build and analyze models that include a significant fraction of the
      protein interactions that comprise a signaling network, with incorporation of the
      site-specific details of the interactions. Modeling at this level of detail is
      important for understanding cellular signaling.

TI  - A computable cellular stress network model for non-diseased pulmonary and
      cardiovascular tissue.
PG  - 168
AB  - Background: Humans and other organisms are equipped with a set of responses that 
      can prevent damage from exposure to a multitude of endogenous and environmental
      stressors. If these stress responses are overwhelmed, this can result in
      pathogenesis of diseases, which is reflected by an increased development of,
      e.g., pulmonary and cardiac diseases in humans exposed to chronic levels of
      environmental stress, including inhaled cigarette smoke (CS). Systems biology
      data sets (e.g., transcriptomics, phosphoproteomics, metabolomics) could enable
      comprehensive investigation of the biological impact of these stressors. However,
      detailed mechanistic networks are needed to determine which specific pathways are
      activated in response to different stressors and to drive the qualitative and
      eventually quantitative assessment of these data. A current limiting step in this
      process is the availability of detailed mechanistic networks that can be used as 
      an analytical substrate. Results: We have built a detailed network model that
      captures the biology underlying the physiological cellular response to endogenous
      and exogenous stressors in non-diseased mammalian pulmonary and cardiovascular
      cells. The contents of the network model reflect several diverse areas of
      signaling, including oxidative stress, hypoxia, shear stress, endoplasmic
      reticulum stress, and xenobiotic stress, that are elicited in response to common 
      pulmonary and cardiovascular stressors. We then tested the ability of the network
      model to identify the mechanisms that are activated in response to CS, a broad
      inducer of cellular stress. Using transcriptomic data from the lungs of mice
      exposed to CS, the network model identified a robust increase in the oxidative
      stress response, largely mediated by the anti-oxidant NRF2 pathways, consistent
      with previous reports on the impact of CS exposure in the mammalian lung.
      Conclusions: The results presented here describe the construction of a cellular
      stress network model and its application towards the analysis of environmental
      stress using transcriptomic data. The proof-of-principle analysis described here,
      coupled with the future development of additional network models covering
      distinct areas of biology, will help to further clarify the integrated biological
      responses elicited by complex environmental stressors such as CS, in pulmonary
      and cardiovascular cells.

TI  - Construction of a computable cell proliferation network focused on non-diseased
      lung cells.
PG  - 105
AB  - Background: Critical to advancing the systems-level evaluation of complex
      biological processes is the development of comprehensive networks and
      computational methods to apply to the analysis of systems biology data
      (transcriptomics, proteomics/phosphoproteomics, metabolomics, etc.). Ideally,
      these networks will be specifically designed to capture the normal, non-diseased 
      biology of the tissue or cell types under investigation, and can be used with
      experimentally generated systems biology data to assess the biological impact of 
      perturbations like xenobiotics and other cellular stresses. Lung cell
      proliferation is a key biological process to capture in such a network model,
      given the pivotal role that proliferation plays in lung diseases including
      cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and fibrosis.
      Unfortunately, no such network has been available prior to this work. Results: To
      further a systems-level assessment of the biological impact of perturbations on
      non-diseased mammalian lung cells, we constructed a lung-focused network for cell
      proliferation. The network encompasses diverse biological areas that lead to the 
      regulation of normal lung cell proliferation (Cell Cycle, Growth Factors, Cell
      Interaction, Intra- and Extracellular Signaling, and Epigenetics), and contains a
      total of 848 nodes (biological entities) and 1597 edges (relationships between
      biological entities). The network was verified using four published gene
      expression profiling data sets associated with measured cell proliferation
      endpoints in lung and lung-related cell types. Predicted changes in the activity 
      of core machinery involved in cell cycle regulation (RB1, CDKN1A, and MYC/MYCN)
      are statistically supported across multiple data sets, underscoring the general
      applicability of this approach for a network-wide biological impact assessment
      using systems biology data. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this
      lung-focused Cell Proliferation Network provides the most comprehensive
      connectivity map in existence of the molecular mechanisms regulating cell
      proliferation in the lung. The network is based on fully referenced causal
      relationships obtained from extensive evaluation of the literature. The
      computable structure of the network enables its application to the qualitative
      and quantitative evaluation of cell proliferation using systems biology data
      sets. The network is available for public use.

TI  - Targeting the MET receptor tyrosine kinase in non-small cell lung cancer:
      emerging role of tivantinib.
PG  - 397-404
AB  - MET receptor tyrosine kinase and its natural ligand, hepatocyte growth factor,
      have been implicated in a variety of cancers, including non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Mechanisms by which cellular deregulation of MET occurs include
      overexpression, genomic amplification, mutation, or alternative splicing. MET
      overexpression or activation is a known cause of acquired resistance to epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in NSCLC. Inhibition of 
      MET signaling in these EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-resistant cells may
      potentially restore sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors. Tivantinib (ARQ 197),
      reported as a small-molecule MET inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity
      in early clinical studies. This review focuses on MET and lung cancer, the
      clinical development of tivantinib, the clinical trials of tivantinib in NSCLC to
      date, its current/emerging role in the management of NSCLC, and future
      directions.

TI  - Exosomes in Prostate Cancer: Putting Together the Pieces of a Puzzle.
PG  - 1522-44
AB  - Exosomes have been shown to act as mediators for cell to cell communication and
      as a potential source of biomarkers for many diseases, including prostate cancer.
      Exosomes are nanosized vesicles secreted by cells and consist of proteins
      normally found in multivesicular bodies, RNA, DNA and lipids. As a potential
      source of biomarkers, exosomes have attracted considerable attention, as their
      protein content resembles that of their cells of origin, even though it is noted 
      that the proteins, miRNAs and lipids found in the exosomes are not a reflective
      stoichiometric sampling of the contents from the parent cells. While the
      biogenesis of exosomes in dendritic cells and platelets has been extensively
      characterized, much less is known about the biogenesis of exosomes in cancer
      cells. An understanding of the processes involved in prostate cancer will help to
      further elucidate the role of exosomes and other extracellular vesicles in
      prostate cancer progression and metastasis. There are few methodologies available
      for general isolation of exosomes, however validation of those methodologies is
      necessary to study the role of exosomal-derived biomarkers in various diseases.
      In this review, we discuss “exosomes” as a member of the family of extracellular 
      vesicles and their potential to provide candidate biomarkers for prostate cancer.

TI  - When ubiquitination meets phosphorylation: a systems biology perspective of
      EGFR/MAPK signalling.
PG  - 52
AB  - Ubiquitination, the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to target proteins, has
      emerged as a ubiquitous post-translational modification (PTM) whose function
      extends far beyond its original role as a tag for protein degradation identified 
      three decades ago. Although sharing parallel properties with phosphorylation,
      ubiquitination distinguishes itself in important ways. Nevertheless, the
      interplay and crosstalk between ubiquitination and phosphorylation events have
      become a recurrent theme in cell signalling regulation. Understanding how these
      two major PTMs intersect to regulate signal transduction is an important research
      question. In this review, we first discuss the involvement of ubiquitination in
      the regulation of the EGF-mediated ERK signalling pathway via the EGF receptor,
      highlighting the interplay between ubiquitination and phosphorylation in this
      cancer-implicated system and addressing open questions. The roles of
      ubiquitination in pathways crosstalking to EGFR/MAPK signalling will then be
      discussed. In the final part of the review, we demonstrate the rich and versatile
      dynamics of crosstalk between ubiquitination and phosphorylation by using
      quantitative modelling and analysis of network motifs commonly observed in
      cellular processes. We argue that given the overwhelming complexity arising from 
      inter-connected PTMs, a quantitative framework based on systems biology and
      mathematical modelling is needed to efficiently understand their roles in cell
      signalling.

TI  - Alterations of Gab2 signalling complexes in imatinib and dasatinib treated
      chronic myeloid leukaemia cells.
PG  - 30
AB  - Background: The Gab2 docking protein acts as an important signal amplifier
      downstream of various growth factor receptors and Bcr-Abl, the driver of chronic 
      myeloid leukaemia (CML). Despite the success of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase
      inhibitors (TKI) in the therapy of CML, TKI-resistance remains an unsolved
      problem in the clinic. We have recently shown that Gab2 signalling counteracts
      the efficacy of four distinct Bcr-Abl inhibitors. In the course of that project, 
      we noticed that two clinically relevant drugs, imatinib and dasatinib, provoke
      distinct alterations in the electrophoretic mobility of Gab2, its signalling
      output and protein interactions. As the signalling potential of the docking
      protein is highly modulated by its phosphorylation status, we set out to obtain
      more insights into the impact of TKIs on Gab2 phosphorylation. Findings: Using
      stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based
      quantitative mass spectrometry (MS), we show now that imatinib and dasatinib
      provoke distinct effects on the phosphorylation status and interactome of Gab2.
      This study identifies several new phosphorylation sites on Gab2 and confirms many
      sites previously known from other experimental systems. At equimolar
      concentrations, dasatinib is more effective in preventing Gab2 tyrosine and
      serine/threonine phosphorylation than imatinib. It also affects the
      phosphorylation status of more residues than imatinib. In addition, we also
      identify novel components of the Gab2 signalling complex, such as casein kinases,
      stathmins and PIP1 as well as known interaction partners whose association with
      Gab2 is disrupted by imatinib and/or dasatinib. Conclusions: By using MS-based
      proteomics, we have identified new and confirmed known phosphorylation sites and 
      interaction partners of Gab2, which may play an important role in the regulation 
      of this docking protein. Given the growing importance of Gab2 in several tumour
      entities we expect that our results will help to understand the complex
      regulation of Gab2 and how this docking protein can contribute to malignancy.

TI  - Structural and functional characteristics of cGMP-dependent methionine oxidation 
      in Arabidopsis thaliana proteins.
PG  - 1
AB  - Background: Increasing structural and biochemical evidence suggests that
      post-translational methionine oxidation of proteins is not just a result of
      cellular damage but may provide the cell with information on the cellular
      oxidative status. In addition, oxidation of methionine residues in key regulatory
      proteins, such as calmodulin, does influence cellular homeostasis. Previous
      findings also indicate that oxidation of methionine residues in signaling
      molecules may have a role in stress responses since these specific structural
      modifications can in turn change biological activities of proteins. Findings:
      Here we use tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics to show that treatment of
      Arabidopsis thaliana cells with a non-oxidative signaling molecule, the
      cell-permeant second messenger analogue, 8-bromo-3,5-cyclic guanosine
      monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP), results in a time-dependent increase in the content of
      oxidised methionine residues. Interestingly, the group of proteins affected by
      cGMP-dependent methionine oxidation is functionally enriched for stress response 
      proteins. Furthermore, we also noted distinct signatures in the frequency of
      amino acids flanking oxidised and un-oxidised methionine residues on both the C- 
      and N-terminus. Conclusions: Given both a structural and functional bias in
      methionine oxidation events in response to a signaling molecule, we propose that 
      these are indicative of a specific role of such post-translational modifications 
      in the direct or indirect regulation of cellular responses. The mechanisms that
      determine the specificity of the modifications remain to be elucidated.

TI  - Complex formation of EphB1/Nck/Caskin1 leads to tyrosine phosphorylation and
      structural changes of the Caskin1 SH3 domain.
PG  - 36
AB  - Background: Scaffold proteins have an important role in the regulation of signal 
      propagation. These proteins do not possess any enzymatic activity but can
      contribute to the formation of multiprotein complexes. Although scaffold proteins
      are present in all cell types, the nervous system contains them in the largest
      amount. Caskin proteins are typically present in neuronal cells, particularly, in
      the synapses. However, the signaling mechanisms by which Caskin proteins are
      regulated are largely unknown. Results: Here we demonstrate that EphB1 receptor
      tyrosine kinase can recruit Caskin1 through the adaptor protein Nck. Upon
      activation of the receptor kinase, the SH2 domain of Nck binds to one of its
      tyrosine residues, while Nck SH3 domains interact with the proline-rich domain of
      Caskin1. Complex formation of the receptor, adaptor and scaffold proteins results
      in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Caskin1 on its SH3 domain. The phosphorylation
      sites were identified by mass-spectrometry as tyrosines 296 and 336. To reveal
      the structural consequence of this phosphorylation, CD spectroscopy was
      performed. This measurement suggests that upon tyrosine phosphorylation the
      structure of the Caskin1 SH3 domain changes significantly. Conclusion: Taken
      together, we propose that the scaffold protein Caskin1 can form a complex with
      the EphB1 tyrosine kinase via the Nck protein as a linker. Complex formation
      results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the Caskin1 SH3 domain. Although we were
      not able to identify any physiological partner of the SH3 domain so far, we could
      demonstrate that phosphorylation on conserved tyrosine residues results in marked
      changes in the structure of the SH3 domain.

TI  - Functions of the Lyn tyrosine kinase in health and disease.
PG  - 21
AB  - Abstract: Src family kinases such as Lyn are important signaling intermediaries, 
      relaying and modulating different inputs to regulate various outputs, such as
      proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration and metabolism.
      Intriguingly, Lyn can mediate both positive and negative signaling processes
      within the same or different cellular contexts. This duality is exemplified by
      the B-cell defect in Lyn−/− mice in which Lyn is essential for negative
      regulation of the B-cell receptor; conversely, B-cells expressing a dominant
      active mutant of Lyn (Lynup/up) have elevated activities of positive regulators
      of the B-cell receptor due to this hyperactive kinase. Lyn has well-established
      functions in most haematopoietic cells, viz. progenitors via influencing c-kit
      signaling, through to mature cell receptor/integrin signaling, e.g. erythrocytes,
      platelets, mast cells and macrophages. Consequently, there is an important role
      for this kinase in regulating hematopoietic abnormalities. Lyn is an important
      regulator of autoimmune diseases such as asthma and psoriasis, due to its
      profound ability to influence immune cell signaling. Lyn has also been found to
      be important for maintaining the leukemic phenotype of many different liquid
      cancers including acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) 
      and B-cell lymphocytic leukaemia (BCLL). Lyn is also expressed in some solid
      tumors and here too it is establishing itself as a potential therapeutic target
      for prostate, glioblastoma, colon and more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. 
      Lay Abstract: To relay information, a cell uses enzymes that put molecular
      markers on specific proteins so they interact with other proteins or move to
      specific parts of the cell to have particular functions. A protein called Lyn is 
      one of these enzymes that regulate information transfer within cells to modulate 
      cell growth, survival and movement. Depending on which type of cell and the
      source of the information input, Lyn can positively or negatively regulate the
      information output. This ability of Lyn to be able to both turn on and turn off
      the relay of information inside cells makes it difficult to fully understand its 
      precise function in each specific circumstance. Lyn has important functions for
      cells involved in blood development, including different while blood cells as
      well as red blood cells, and in particular for the immune cells that produce
      antibodies (B-cells), as exemplified by the major B-cell abnormalities that mice 
      with mutations in the Lyn gene display. Certain types of leukaemia and lymphoma
      appear to have too much Lyn activity that in part causes the characteristics of
      these diseases, suggesting it may be a good target to develop new anti-leukaemia 
      drugs. Furthermore, some specific types, and even specific subtypes, of solid
      cancers, e.g. prostate, brain and breast cancer can also have abnormal regulation
      of Lyn. Consequently, targeting this protein in these cancers could also prove to
      be beneficial.

TI  - Macroscopic law of conservation revealed in the population dynamics of Toll-like 
      receptor signaling.
PG  - 9
AB  - Stimulating the receptors of a single cell generates stochastic intracellular
      signaling. The fluctuating response has been attributed to the low abundance of
      signaling molecules and the spatio-temporal effects of diffusion and crowding. At
      population level, however, cells are able to execute well-defined deterministic
      biological processes such as growth, division, differentiation and immune
      response. These data reflect biology as a system possessing microscopic and
      macroscopic dynamics. This commentary discusses the average population response
      of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and 4 signaling. Without requiring detailed
      experimental data, linear response equations together with the fundamental law of
      information conservation have been used to decipher novel network features such
      as unknown intermediates, processes and cross-talk mechanisms. For single cell
      response, however, such simplicity seems far from reality. Thus, as observed in
      any other complex systems, biology can be considered to possess order and
      disorder, inheriting a mixture of predictable population level and unpredictable 
      single cell outcomes.

AB  - Prion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are fatal
      diseases associated with the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) to
      the abnormal prion protein (PrPSc). Since the molecular mechanisms in
      pathogenesis are widely unclear, we analyzed the global phospho-proteome and
      detected a differential pattern of tyrosine- and threonine phosphorylated
      proteins in PrPSc-replicating and pentosan polysulfate (PPS)-rescued N2a cells in
      two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. To quantify phosphorylated proteins, we
      performed a SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture)
      analysis and identified 105 proteins, which showed a regulated phosphorylation
      upon PrPSc infection. Among those proteins, we validated the dephosphorylation of
      stathmin and Cdc2 and the induced phosphorylation of cofilin in PrPSc-infected
      N2a cells in Western blot analyses. Our analysis showed for the first time a
      differentially regulated phospho-proteome in PrPSc infection, which could
      contribute to the establishment of novel protein markers and to the development
      of novel therapeutic intervention strategies in targeting prion-associated
      disease.

TI  - Early cellular signaling responses to axonal injury.
PG  - 5
AB  - Background: We have used optic nerve injury as a model to study early signaling
      events in neuronal tissue following axonal injury. Optic nerve injury results in 
      the selective death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The time course of cell
      death takes place over a period of days with the earliest detection of RGC death 
      at about 48 hr post injury. We hypothesized that in the period immediately
      following axonal injury, there are changes in the soma that signal surrounding
      glia and neurons and that start programmed cell death. In the current study, we
      investigated early changes in cellular signaling and gene expression that occur
      within the first 6 hrs post optic nerve injury. Results: We found evidence of
      cell to cell signaling within 30 min of axonal injury. We detected differences in
      phosphoproteins and gene expression within the 6 hrs time period. Activation of
      TNFα and glutamate receptors, two pathways that can initiate cell death, begins
      in RGCs within 6 hrs following axonal injury. Differential gene expression at 6
      hrs post injury included genes involved in cytokine, neurotrophic factor
      signaling (Socs3) and apoptosis (Bax). Conclusion: We interpret our studies to
      indicate that both neurons and glia in the retina have been signaled within 30
      min after optic nerve injury. The signals are probably initiated by the RGC soma.
      In addition, signals activating cellular death pathways occur within 6 hrs of
      injury, which likely lead to RGC degeneration.

TI  - Mechanisms of Activation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases: Monomers or Dimers.
PG  - 304-30
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play essential roles in cellular processes,
      including metabolism, cell-cycle control, survival, proliferation, motility and
      differentiation. RTKs are all synthesized as single-pass transmembrane proteins
      and bind polypeptide ligands, mainly growth factors. It has long been thought
      that all RTKs, except for the insulin receptor (IR) family, are activated by
      ligand-induced dimerization of the receptors. An increasing number of diverse
      studies, however, indicate that RTKs, previously thought to exist as monomers,
      are present as pre-formed, yet inactive, dimers prior to ligand binding. The
      non-covalently associated dimeric structures are reminiscent of those of the IR
      family, which has a disulfide-linked dimeric structure. Furthermore, recent
      progress in structural studies has provided insight into the underpinnings of
      conformational changes during the activation of RTKs. In this review, I discuss
      two mutually exclusive models for the mechanisms of activation of the epidermal
      growth factor receptor, the neurotrophin receptor and IR families, based on these
      new insights.

TI  - The effect of disease on human cardiac protein expression profiles in paired
      samples from right and left ventricles.
PG  - 34
AB  - Background: Cardiac diseases (e.g. coronary and valve) are associated with
      ventricular cellular remodeling. However, ventricular biopsies from left and
      right ventricles from patients with different pathologies are rare and thus
      little is known about disease-induced cellular remodeling in both sides of the
      heart and between different diseases. We hypothesized that the protein expression
      profiles between right and left ventricles of patients with aortic valve stenosis
      (AVS) and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are different and that the 
      protein profile is different between the two diseases. Left and right ventricular
      biopsies were collected from patients with either CAD or AVS. The biopsies were
      processed for proteomic analysis using isobaric tandem mass tagging and analyzed 
      by reverse phase nano-LC-MS/MS. Western blot for selected proteins showed strong 
      correlation with proteomic analysis. Results: Proteomic analysis between
      ventricles of the same disease (intra-disease) and between ventricles of
      different diseases (inter-disease) identified more than 500 proteins detected in 
      all relevant ventricular biopsies. Comparison between ventricles and disease
      state was focused on proteins with relatively high fold (±1.2 fold difference)
      and significant (P < 0.05) differences. Intra-disease protein expression
      differences between left and right ventricles were largely structural for AVS
      patients and largely signaling/metabolism for CAD. Proteins commonly associated
      with hypertrophy were also different in the AVS group but with lower fold
      difference. Inter-disease differences between left ventricles of AVS and CAD were
      detected in 9 proteins. However, inter-disease differences between the right
      ventricles of CAD and AVS patients were associated with differences in 73
      proteins. The majority of proteins which had a significant difference in one
      ventricle compared to the other pathology also had a similar trend in the
      adjacent ventricle. Conclusions: This work demonstrates for the first time that
      left and right ventricles have a different proteome and that the difference is
      dependent on the type of disease. Inter-disease differential expression was more 
      prominent for right ventricles. The finding that a protein change in one
      ventricle was often associated with a similar trend in the adjacent ventricle for
      a large number of proteins suggests cross-talk proteome remodeling between
      adjacent ventricles.

AB  - During the past several decades, the understanding of cancer at the molecular
      level has been primarily focused on mechanisms on how signaling molecules
      transform homeostatically balanced cells into malignant ones within an individual
      pathway. However, it is becoming more apparent that pathways are dynamic and
      crosstalk at different control points of the signaling cascades, making the
      traditional linear signaling models inadequate to interpret complex biological
      systems. Recent technological advances in high throughput, deep sequencing for
      the human genomes and proteomic technologies to comprehensively characterize the 
      human proteomes in conjunction with multiplexed targeted proteomic assays to
      measure panels of proteins involved in biologically relevant pathways have made
      significant progress in understanding cancer at the molecular level. It is
      undeniable that proteomic profiling of differentially expressed proteins under
      many perturbation conditions, or between normal and “diseased” states is
      important to capture a first glance at the overall proteomic landscape, which has
      been a main focus of proteomics research during the past 15-20 years. However,
      the research community is gradually shifting its heavy focus from that initial
      discovery step to protein target verification using multiplexed quantitative
      proteomic assays, capable of measuring changes in proteins and their interacting 
      partners, isoforms, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in response to
      stimuli in the context of signaling pathways and protein networks. With a
      critical link to genotypes (i.e., high throughput genomics and transcriptomics
      data), new and complementary information can be gleaned from multi-dimensional
      omics data to (1) assess the effect of genomic and transcriptomic aberrations on 
      such complex molecular machinery in the context of cell signaling architectures
      associated with pathological diseases such as cancer (i.e., from genotype to
      proteotype to phenotype); and (2) target pathway- and network-driven changes and 
      map the fluctuations of these functional units (proteins) responsible for
      cellular activities in response to perturbation in a spatiotemporal fashion to
      better understand cancer biology as a whole system.

TI  - Proteomic analysis of ERK1/2-mediated human sickle red blood cell membrane
      protein phosphorylation.
PG  - 1
AB  - Background: In sickle cell disease (SCD), the mitogen-activated protein kinase
      (MAPK) ERK1/2 is constitutively active and can be inducible by
      agonist-stimulation only in sickle but not in normal human red blood cells
      (RBCs). ERK1/2 is involved in activation of ICAM-4-mediated sickle RBC adhesion
      to the endothelium. However, other effects of the ERK1/2 activation in sickle
      RBCs leading to the complex SCD pathophysiology, such as alteration of RBC
      hemorheology are unknown. Results: To further characterize global ERK1/2-induced 
      changes in membrane protein phosphorylation within human RBCs, a label-free
      quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis was applied to sickle and normal RBC
      membrane ghosts pre-treated with U0126, a specific inhibitor of MEK1/2, the
      upstream kinase of ERK1/2, in the presence or absence of recombinant active ERK2.
      Across eight unique treatment groups, 375 phosphopeptides from 155
      phosphoproteins were quantified with an average technical coefficient of
      variation in peak intensity of 19.8%. Sickle RBC treatment with U0126 decreased
      thirty-six phosphopeptides from twenty-one phosphoproteins involved in regulation
      of not only RBC shape, flexibility, cell morphology maintenance and adhesion, but
      also glucose and glutamate transport, cAMP production, degradation of misfolded
      proteins and receptor ubiquitination. Glycophorin A was the most affected protein
      in sickle RBCs by this ERK1/2 pathway, which contained 12 unique phosphorylated
      peptides, suggesting that in addition to its effect on sickle RBC adhesion,
      increased glycophorin A phosphorylation via the ERK1/2 pathway may also affect
      glycophorin A interactions with band 3, which could result in decreases in both
      anion transport by band 3 and band 3 trafficking. The abundance of twelve of the 
      thirty-six phosphopeptides were subsequently increased in normal RBCs
      co-incubated with recombinant ERK2 and therefore represent specific MEK1/2
      phospho-inhibitory targets mediated via ERK2. Conclusions: These findings expand 
      upon the current model for the involvement of ERK1/2 signaling in RBCs. These
      findings also identify additional protein targets of this pathway other than the 
      RBC adhesion molecule ICAM-4 and enhance the understanding of the mechanism of
      small molecule inhibitors of MEK/1/2/ERK1/2, which could be effective in
      ameliorating RBC hemorheology and adhesion, the hallmarks of SCD.

      biomarkers, which are functionally changed during disease development,

      significance, research and potential application for network biomarkers,
      interaction networks and dynamical network biomarkers (DNB). Disease-specific
      interaction networks, network biomarkers, or DNB have great significance in the
      understanding of molecular pathogenesis, risk assessment, disease classification 
      and monitoring, or evaluations of therapeutic responses and toxicities.
      Protein-based DNB will provide more information to define the differences between
      the normal and pre-disease stages, which might point to early diagnosis for
      patients. Clinical bioinformatics should be a key approach to the identification 
      and validation of disease-specific biomarkers.

      understanding the structure and dynamics of signaling networks. Approaches such
      as affinity purification followed by MS have also been used to elucidate relevant
      biological questions in health and disease.The study of proteomes and

      studies also facilitate drug target protein identification which may be
      clinically useful in the near future.Here, we provide an overview of general
      principles of signaling pathways versus phosphorylation. Likewise, we detail
      chemical phosphoproteomic tools, including pros and cons with examples where
      these methods have been applied. In addition, basic clues of electrospray
      ionization and collision induced dissociation fragmentation are detailed in a
      simple manner for successful phosphoproteomic clinical studies.

TI  - Relevant phosphoproteomic and mass spectrometry: approaches useful in clinical
      research.
PG  - 2
AB  - Background: "It's not what we do, it's the way that we do it". Never has this
      maxim been truer in proteomics than now. Mass Spectrometry-based
      proteomics/phosphoproteomics tools are critical to understand the structure and
      dynamics (spatial and temporal) of signalling that engages and migrates through
      the entire proteome. Approaches such as affinity purification followed by Mass
      Spectrometry (MS) have been used to elucidate relevant biological questions
      disease vs. health. Thousands of proteins interact via physical and chemical
      association. Moreover, certain proteins can covalently modify other proteins
      post-translationally. These post-translational modifications (PTMs) ultimately
      give rise to the emergent functions of cells in sequence, space and time.
      Findings: Understanding the functions of phosphorylated proteins thus requires
      one to study proteomes as linked-systems rather than collections of individual
      protein molecules. Indeed, the interacting proteome or protein-network knowledge 
      has recently received much attention, as network-systems (signalling pathways)
      are effective snapshots in time, of the proteome as a whole. MS approaches are
      clearly essential, in spite of the difficulties of some low abundance proteins
      for future clinical advances. Conclusion: Clinical proteomics-MS has come a long 
      way in the past decade in terms of technology/platform development, protein
      chemistry, and together with bioinformatics and other OMICS tools to identify
      molecular signatures of diseases based on protein pathways and signalling
      cascades. Hence, there is great promise for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and
      prediction of therapeutic outcome on an individualized basis. However, and as a
      general rule, without correct study design, strategy and implementation of robust
      analytical methodologies, the efforts, efficiency and expectations to make
      biomarkers (especially phosphorylated kinases) a useful reality in the near
      future, can easily be hampered.

TI  - RegPhos 2.0: an updated resource to explore protein kinase–substrate
      phosphorylation networks in mammals.
LID - bau034
AB  - Protein phosphorylation catalyzed by kinases plays crucial roles in regulating a 
      variety of intracellular processes. Owing to an increasing number of in vivo
      phosphorylation sites that have been identified by mass spectrometry (MS)-based
      proteomics, the RegPhos, available online at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/RegPhos2/,
      was developed to explore protein phosphorylation networks in human. In this
      update, we not only enhance the data content in human but also investigate
      kinase–substrate phosphorylation networks in mouse and rat. The experimentally
      validated phosphorylation sites as well as their catalytic kinases were extracted
      from public resources, and MS/MS phosphopeptides were manually curated from
      research articles. RegPhos 2.0 aims to provide a more comprehensive view of
      intracellular signaling networks by integrating the information of metabolic
      pathways and protein–protein interactions. A case study shows that analyzing the 
      phosphoproteome profile of time-dependent cell activation obtained from Liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, the RegPhos deciphered not 
      only the consistent scheme in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway but also
      novel regulatory molecules that may involve in it. With an attempt to help users 
      efficiently identify the candidate biomarkers in cancers, 30 microarray
      experiments, including 39 cancerous versus normal cells, were analyzed for
      detecting cancer-specific expressed genes coding for kinases and their
      substrates. Furthermore, this update features an improved web interface to
      facilitate convenient access to the exploration of phosphorylation networks for a
      group of genes/proteins.Database URL: http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/RegPhos2/

      of TSLP include dendritic cells, B cells, mast cells, regulatory T (Treg) cells
      and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The TSLP/TSLPR axis can activate multiple signaling
      transduction pathways including the JAK/STAT pathway and the PI-3 kinase pathway.
      Aberrant TSLP/TSLPR signaling has been associated with a variety of human
      diseases including asthma, atopic dermatitis, nasal polyposis, inflammatory bowel
      disease, eosinophilic eosophagitis and, most recently, acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia. A centralized resource of the TSLP signaling pathway cataloging
      signaling events is not yet available. In this study, we present a
      literature-annotated resource of reactions in the TSLP signaling pathway. This
      pathway map is publicly available through NetPath (http://www.netpath.org/), an
      open access signal transduction pathway resource developed previously by our
      group. This map includes 236 molecules and 252 reactions that are involved in
      TSLP/TSLPR signaling pathway. We expect that the TSLP signaling pathway map will 
      provide a rich resource to study the biology of this important cytokine as well
      as to identify novel therapeutic targets for diseases associated with
      dysregulated TSLP/TSLPR signaling.Database URL:

TI  - ANIA: ANnotation and Integrated Analysis of the 14-3-3 interactome.
LID - bat085
AB  - The dimeric 14-3-3 proteins dock onto pairs of phosphorylated Ser and Thr
      residues on hundreds of proteins, and thereby regulate many events in mammalian
      cells. To facilitate global analyses of these interactions, we developed a web
      resource named ANIA: ANnotation and Integrated Analysis of the 14-3-3
      interactome, which integrates multiple data sets on 14-3-3-binding
      phosphoproteins. ANIA also pinpoints candidate 14-3-3-binding phosphosites using 
      predictor algorithms, assisted by our recent discovery that the human
      14-3-3-interactome is highly enriched in 2R-ohnologues. 2R-ohnologues are
      proteins in families of two to four, generated by two rounds of whole genome
      duplication at the origin of the vertebrate animals. ANIA identifies candidate
      ‘lynchpins’, which are 14-3-3-binding phosphosites that are conserved across
      members of a given 2R-ohnologue protein family. Other features of ANIA include a 
      link to the catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer database to find cancer
      polymorphisms that map to 14-3-3-binding phosphosites, which would be expected to
      interfere with 14-3-3 interactions. We used ANIA to map known and candidate
      14-3-3-binding enzymes within the 2R-ohnologue complement of the human kinome.
      Our projections indicate that 14-3-3s dock onto many more human kinases than has 
      been realized. Guided by ANIA, PAK4, 6 and 7 (p21-activated kinases 4, 6 and 7)
      were experimentally validated as a 2R-ohnologue family of 14-3-3-binding
      phosphoproteins. PAK4 binding to 14-3-3 is stimulated by phorbol ester, and
      involves the ‘lynchpin’ site phosphoSer99 and a major contribution from Ser181.
      In contrast, PAK6 and PAK7 display strong phorbol ester-independent binding to
      14-3-3, with Ser113 critical for the interaction with PAK6. These data point to
      differential 14-3-3 regulation of PAKs in control of cell morphology.Database

TI  - A secretory kinase complex regulates extracellular protein phosphorylation.
LID - e06120
AB  - Although numerous extracellular phosphoproteins have been identified, the protein
      kinases within the secretory pathway have only recently been discovered, and
      their regulation is virtually unexplored. Fam20C is the physiological Golgi
      casein kinase, which phosphorylates many secreted proteins and is critical for
      proper biomineralization. Fam20A, a Fam20C paralog, is essential for enamel
      formation, but the biochemical function of Fam20A is unknown. Here we show that
      Fam20A potentiates Fam20C kinase activity and promotes the phosphorylation of
      enamel matrix proteins in vitro and in cells. Mechanistically, Fam20A is a
      pseudokinase that forms a functional complex with Fam20C, and this complex
      enhances extracellular protein phosphorylation within the secretory pathway. Our 
      findings shed light on the molecular mechanism by which Fam20C and Fam20A
      collaborate to control enamel formation, and provide the first insight into the
      regulation of secretory pathway
      phosphorylation.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06120.001

TI  - Regulation of EGFR signal transduction by analogue-to-digital conversion in
      endosomes.
LID - e06156
AB  - An outstanding question is how receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) determine
      different cell-fate decisions despite sharing the same signalling cascades. Here,
      we uncovered an unexpected mechanism of RTK trafficking in this process. By
      quantitative high-resolution FRET microscopy, we found that phosphorylated
      epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR) is not randomly distributed but
      packaged at constant mean amounts in endosomes. Cells respond to higher EGF
      concentrations by increasing the number of endosomes but keeping the mean p-EGFR 
      content per endosome almost constant. By mathematical modelling, we found that
      this mechanism confers both robustness and regulation to signalling output.
      Different growth factors caused specific changes in endosome number and size in
      various cell systems and changing the distribution of p-EGFR between endosomes
      was sufficient to reprogram cell-fate decision upon EGF stimulation. We propose
      that the packaging of p-RTKs in endosomes is a general mechanism to ensure the
      fidelity and specificity of the signalling
      response.DOI:http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06156.001

TI  - Talking to chromatin: post-translational modulation of polycomb group function.
PG  - 10
AB  - Polycomb Group proteins are important epigenetic regulators of gene expression.
      Epigenetic control by polycomb Group proteins involves intrinsic as well as
      associated enzymatic activities. Polycomb target genes change with cellular
      context, lineage commitment and differentiation status, revealing dynamic
      regulation of polycomb function. It is currently unclear how this dynamic
      modulation is controlled and how signaling affects polycomb-mediated epigenetic
      processes at the molecular level. Experimental evidence on regulation of polycomb
      function by post-translational mechanisms is steadily emerging: Polycomb Group
      proteins are targeted for ubiquitylation, sumoylation and phosphorylation. In
      addition, specific Polycomb Group proteins modify other (chromatin) associated
      proteins via similar post-translational modifications. Such modifications affect 
      protein function by affecting protein stability, protein-protein interactions and
      enzymatic activities. Here, we review current insights in covalent modification
      of Polycomb Group proteins in the context of protein function and present a
      tentative view of integrated signaling to chromatin in the context of
      phosphorylation. Clearly, the available literature reveals just the tip of the
      iceberg, and exact molecular mechanisms in, and the biological relevance of
      post-translational regulation of polycomb function await further elucidation. Our
      understanding of causes and consequences of post-translational modification of
      polycomb proteins will gain significantly from in vivo validation experiments.
      Impaired polycomb function has important repercussions for stem cell function,
      development and disease. Ultimately, increased understanding of signaling to
      chromatin and the mechanisms involved in epigenetic remodeling will contribute to
      the development of therapeutic interventions in cell fate decisions in
      development and disease.

TI  - Use and Isolation of Urinary Exosomes as Biomarkers for Diabetic Nephropathy.
LID - 149
AB  - Diabetes represents a major threat to public health and the number of patients is
      increasing alarmingly in the global scale. Particularly, the diabetic kidney
      disease (nephropathy, DN) together with its cardiovascular complications cause
      immense human suffering, highly increased risk of premature deaths, and lead to
      huge societal costs. DN is first detected when protein appears in urine
      (microalbuminuria). As in other persisting proteinuric diseases (like vasculitis)
      it heralds irreversible damage of kidney functions up to non-functional
      (end-stage) kidney and ultimately calls for kidney replacement therapy (dialysis 
      or kidney transplantation). While remarkable progress has been made in
      understanding the genetic and molecular factors associating with chronic kidney
      diseases, breakthroughs are still missing to provide comprehensive understanding 
      of events and mechanisms associated. Non-invasive diagnostic tools for early
      diagnostics of kidney damage are badly needed. Exosomes – small vesicular
      structures present in urine are released by all cell types along kidney
      structures to present with distinct surface assembly. Furthermore, exosomes carry
      a load of special proteins and nucleic acids. This “cargo” faithfully reflects
      the physiological state of their respective cells of origin and appears to serve 
      as a new pathway for downstream signaling to target cells. Accordingly, exosome
      vesicles are emerging as a valuable source for disease stage-specific information
      and as fingerprints of disease progression. Unfortunately, technical issues of
      exosome isolation are challenging and, thus, their full potential remains
      untapped. Here, we review the molecular basis of exosome secretion as well as
      their use to reveal events along the nephron. In addition to novel molecular
      information, the new methods provide the needed accurate, personalized,
      non-invasive, and inexpensive future diagnostics.

TI  - Molecular Basis of Signaling Specificity of Insulin and IGF Receptors: Neglected 
      Corners and Recent Advances.
LID - 34
AB  - Insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptors utilize common
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
      signaling pathways to mediate a broad spectrum of “metabolic” and “mitogenic”
      responses. Specificity of insulin and IGF action in vivo must in part reflect
      expression of receptors and responsive pathways in different tissues but it is
      widely assumed that it is also determined by the ligand binding and signaling
      mechanisms of the receptors. This review focuses on receptor-proximal events in
      insulin/IGF signaling and examines their contribution to specificity of
      downstream responses. Insulin and IGF receptors may differ subtly in the
      efficiency with which they recruit their major substrates (IRS-1 and IRS-2 and
      Shc) and this could influence effectiveness of signaling to “metabolic” and
      “mitogenic” responses. Other substrates (Grb2-associated binder, downstream of
      kinases, SH2Bs, Crk), scaffolds (RACK1, β-arrestins, cytohesins), and pathways
      (non-receptor tyrosine kinases, phosphoinositide kinases, reactive oxygen
      species) have been less widely studied. Some of these components appear to be
      specifically involved in “metabolic” or “mitogenic” signaling but it has not been
      shown that this reflects receptor-preferential interaction. Very few
      receptor-specific interactions have been characterized, and their roles in
      signaling are unclear. Signaling specificity might also be imparted by
      differences in intracellular trafficking or feedback regulation of receptors, but
      few studies have directly addressed this possibility. Although published data are
      not wholly conclusive, no evidence has yet emerged for signaling mechanisms that 
      are specifically engaged by insulin receptors but not IGF receptors or vice
      versa, and there is only limited evidence for differential activation of
      signaling mechanisms that are common to both receptors. Cellular context, rather 
      than intrinsic receptor activity, therefore appears to be the major determinant
      of whether responses to insulin and IGFs are perceived as “metabolic” or
      “mitogenic.”

      to reproduce. The developmental timing of this transition is controlled by pulses
      of steroid hormones, but how these pulses are generated have remained unclear? A 
      recent paper shows that in Drosophila larvae, nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of
      DHR4, a nuclear receptor, in response to prothoracicotropic hormone signaling, is
      critical for producing the correct temporal pulses of steroid hormones that
      coordinate the juvenile–adult transition.

TI  - Toward a systems-level view of dynamic phosphorylation networks.
LID - 263
AB  - To better understand how cells sense and respond to their environment, it is
      important to understand the organization and regulation of the phosphorylation
      networks that underlie most cellular signal transduction pathways. These
      networks, which are composed of protein kinases, protein phosphatases and their
      respective cellular targets, are highly dynamic. Importantly, to achieve
      signaling specificity, phosphorylation networks must be regulated at several
      levels, including at the level of protein expression, substrate recognition, and 
      spatiotemporal modulation of enzymatic activity. Here, we briefly summarize some 
      of the traditional methods used to study the phosphorylation status of cellular
      proteins before focusing our attention on several recent technological advances, 
      such as protein microarrays, quantitative mass spectrometry, and
      genetically-targetable fluorescent biosensors, that are offering new insights
      into the organization and regulation of cellular phosphorylation networks.
      Together, these approaches promise to lead to a systems-level view of dynamic
      phosphorylation networks.

TI  - Combining affinity proteomics and network context to identify new phosphatase
      substrates and adapters in growth pathways.
LID - 115
AB  - Protein phosphorylation homoeostasis is tightly controlled and pathological
      conditions are caused by subtle alterations of the cell phosphorylation profile. 
      Altered levels of kinase activities have already been associated to specific
      diseases. Less is known about the impact of phosphatases, the enzymes that
      down-regulate phosphorylation by removing the phosphate groups. This is partly
      due to our poor understanding of the phosphatase-substrate network. Much of
      phosphatase substrate specificity is not based on intrinsic enzyme specificity
      with the catalytic pocket recognizing the sequence/structure context of the
      phosphorylated residue. In addition many phosphatase catalytic subunits do not
      form a stable complex with their substrates. This makes the inference and
      validation of phosphatase substrates a non-trivial task. Here, we present a novel
      approach that builds on the observation that much of phosphatase substrate
      selection is based on the network of physical interactions linking the
      phosphatase to the substrate. We first used affinity proteomics coupled to
      quantitative mass spectrometry to saturate the interactome of eight phosphatases 
      whose down regulations was shown to affect the activation of the RAS-PI3K
      pathway. By integrating information from functional siRNA with protein
      interaction information, we develop a strategy that aims at inferring phosphatase
      physiological substrates. Graph analysis is used to identify protein scaffolds
      that may link the catalytic subunits to their substrates. By this approach we
      rediscover several previously described phosphatase substrate interactions and
      characterize two new protein scaffolds that promote the dephosphorylation of
      PTPN11 and ERK by DUSP18 and DUSP26, respectively.

TI  - Exosomal miRNAs: Biological Properties and Therapeutic Potential.
LID - 56
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding regulatory RNAs that regulate gene
      expression at the post-transcriptional level, are master regulators of a wide
      array of cellular processes. Altered miRNA expression could be a determinant of
      disease development and/or progression and manipulation of miRNA expression
      represents a potential avenue of therapy. Exosomes are cell-derived extracellular
      vesicles that promote cell–cell communication and immunoregulatory functions.
      These “bioactive vesicles” shuttle various molecules, including miRNAs, to
      recipient cells. Inappropriate release of miRNAs from exosomes may cause
      significant alterations in biological pathways that affect disease development,
      supporting the concept that miRNA-containing exosomes could serve as targeted
      therapies for particular diseases. This review briefly summarizes recent advances
      in the biology, function, and therapeutic potential of exosomal miRNAs.

TI  - Chemokine Receptor-Specific Antibodies in Cancer Immunotherapy: Achievements and 
      Challenges.
LID - 12
AB  - The 1990s brought a burst of information regarding the structure, expression
      pattern, and role in leukocyte migration and adhesion of chemokines and their
      receptors. At that time, the FDA approved the first therapeutic antibodies for
      cancer treatment. A few years later, it was reported that the chemokine receptors
      CXCR4 and CCR7 were involved on directing metastases to liver, lung, bone marrow,
      or lymph nodes, and the over-expression of CCR4, CCR6, and CCR9 by certain
      tumors. The possibility of inhibiting the interaction of chemokine receptors
      present on the surface of tumor cells with their ligands emerged as a new
      therapeutic approach. Therefore, many research groups and companies began to
      develop small molecule antagonists and specific antibodies, aiming to neutralize 
      signaling from these receptors. Despite great expectations, so far, only one
      anti-chemokine receptor antibody has been approved for its clinical use,
      mogamulizumab, an anti-CCR4 antibody, granted in Japan to treat refractory adult 
      T-cell leukemia and lymphoma. Here, we review the main achievements obtained with
      anti-chemokine receptor antibodies for cancer immunotherapy, including discovery 
      and clinical studies, proposed mechanisms of action, and therapeutic
      applications.

TI  - An Interaction Library for the FcεRI Signaling Network.
LID - 172
AB  - Antigen receptors play a central role in adaptive immune responses. Although the 
      molecular networks associated with these receptors have been extensively studied,
      we currently lack a systems-level understanding of how combinations of
      non-covalent interactions and post-translational modifications are regulated
      during signaling to impact cellular decision-making. To fill this knowledge gap, 
      it will be necessary to formalize and piece together information about individual
      molecular mechanisms to form large-scale computational models of signaling
      networks. To this end, we have developed an interaction library for signaling by 
      the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcεRI. The library consists of executable rules
      for protein–protein and protein–lipid interactions. This library extends earlier 
      models for FcεRI signaling and introduces new interactions that have not
      previously been considered in a model. Thus, this interaction library is a
      toolkit with which existing models can be expanded and from which new models can 
      be built. As an example, we present models of branching pathways from the adaptor
      protein Lat, which influence production of the phospholipid PIP3 at the plasma
      membrane and the soluble second messenger IP3. We find that inclusion of a
      positive feedback loop gives rise to a bistable switch, which may ensure robust
      responses to stimulation above a threshold level. In addition, the library is
      visualized to facilitate understanding of network circuitry and identification of
      network motifs.

AB  - The predominant expression of the γ and δ isoforms of PI3K in cells of
      hematopoietic lineage prompted speculation that inhibitors of these isoforms
      could offer opportunities for selective targeting of PI3K in the immune system in
      a range of immune-related pathologies. While there has been some success in
      developing PI3Kδ inhibitors, progress in developing selective inhibitors of PI3Kγ
      has been rather disappointing. This has prompted the search for alternative
      targets with which to modulate PI3K signaling specifically in the immune system. 
      One such target is the SH2 domain-containing inositol-5-phosphatase-1 (SHIP-1)
      which de-phosphorylates PI(3,4,5)P3 at the D5 position of the inositol ring to
      create PI(3,4)P2. In this article, we first describe the current state of PI3K
      isoform-selective inhibitor development. We then focus on the structure of SHIP-1
      and its function in the immune system. Finally, we consider the current state of 
      development of small molecule compounds that potently and selectively modulate
      SHIP activity and which offer novel opportunities to manipulate PI3K mediated
      signaling in the immune system.

TI  - gp130 cytokines are positive signals triggering changes in gene expression and
      axon outgrowth in peripheral neurons following injury.
LID - 62
AB  - Adult peripheral neurons, in contrast to adult central neurons, are capable of
      regeneration after axonal damage. Much attention has focused on the changes that 
      accompany this regeneration in two places, the distal nerve segment (where
      phagocytosis of axonal debris, changes in the surface properties of Schwann
      cells, and induction of growth factors and cytokines occur) and the neuronal cell
      body (where dramatic changes in cell morphology and gene expression occur). The
      changes in the axotomized cell body are often referred to as the “cell body
      response.” The focus of the current review is a family of cytokines, the
      glycoprotein 130 (gp130) cytokines, which produce their actions through a common 
      gp130 signaling receptor and which function as injury signals for axotomized
      peripheral neurons, triggering changes in gene expression and in neurite
      outgrowth. These cytokines play important roles in the responses of sympathetic, 
      sensory, and motor neurons to injury. The best studied of these cytokines in this
      context are leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin (IL)-6, but
      experiments with conditional gp130 knockout animals suggest that other members of
      this family, not yet determined, are also involved. The primary gp130 signaling
      pathway shown to be involved is the activation of Janus kinase (JAK) and the
      transcription factors Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT), 
      though other downstream pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase
      (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) may also play a role. gp130
      signaling may involve paracrine, retrograde, and autocrine actions of these
      cytokines. Recent studies suggest that manipulation of this cytokine system can
      also stimulate regeneration by injured central neurons.

TI  - The nuclear events guiding successful nerve regeneration.
LID - 53
AB  - Peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons survive and regenerate after nerve
      injury, whereas central nervous system (CNS) neurons lack the capacity to do so. 
      The inability of the CNS to regenerate presumably results from a lack of
      intrinsic growth activity and a permissive environment. To achieve CNS
      regeneration, we can learn from successful nerve regeneration in the PNS. Neurons
      in the PNS elicit dynamic changes in gene expression in response to permissive
      environmental cues following nerve injury. To switch gene expression on and off
      in injured neurons, transcription factors and their networks should be carefully 
      orchestrated according to the regeneration program. This is the so-called
      “intrinsic power of axonal growth.” There is an increasing repertoire of
      candidate transcription factors induced by nerve injury. Some of them potentiate 
      the survival and axonal regeneration of damaged neurons in vivo; however, our
      knowledge of transcriptional events in injured neurons is still limited. How do
      these transcription factors communicate with each other? How does the
      transcriptional machinery regulate the wide variety of regeneration-associated
      genes (RAGs) in the properly coordinated manner? In this review, we describe our 
      current understanding of the injury-inducible transcriptional factors that
      enhance the intrinsic growth capacity, and propose a potential role for
      specificity protein 1 (Sp1), which provides a platform to recruit
      injury-inducible transcription factors, in simultaneous gene regulation. Finally,
      we discuss an additional mechanism that is involved in epigenetic modifications
      in damaged neurons. A comprehensive understanding of the nuclear events in
      injured neurons will provide clues to clinical interventions for successful nerve
      regeneration.

LID - 95
AB  - The treatment of melanoma by targeted inhibition of the mutated kinase BRAF with 
      small molecules only temporarily suppresses metastatic disease. In the face of
      chemical inhibition tumor plasticity, both innate and adaptive, promotes survival
      through the biochemical and genetic reconfiguration of cellular pathways that can
      engage proliferative and migratory systems. To investigate this process,
      high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to characterize the phosphoproteome of
      this transition in vitro. A simple and accurate, label-free quantitative method
      was used to localize and quantitate thousands of phosphorylation events. We also 
      correlated changes in the phosphoproteome with the proteome to more accurately
      determine changes in the activity of regulatory kinases determined by kinase
      landscape profiling. The abundance of phosphopeptides with sites that function in
      cytoskeletal regulation, GTP/GDP exchange, protein kinase C, IGF signaling, and
      melanosome maturation were highly divergent after transition to a drug resistant 
      phenotype.

TI  - The Emerging Role of Exosomes in Epithelial–Mesenchymal-Transition in Cancer.
LID - 361
AB  - Metastasis in cancer consists of multiple steps, including
      epithelial–mesenchymal-transition (EMT), which is characterized by the loss of
      epithelial-like characteristics and the gain of mesenchymal-like attributes
      including cell migration and invasion. It is clear that the tumor
      microenvironment can promote the metastatic cascade and that intercellular
      communication is necessary for this to occur. Exosomes are small membranous
      vesicles secreted by most cell types into the extracellular environment and they 
      are important communicators in the tumor microenvironment. They promote
      angiogenesis, invasion, and proliferation in recipient cells to support tumor
      growth and a prometastatic phenotype. Although it is clear that exosomes
      contribute to cancer cell plasticity, experimental evidence to define exosome
      induced plasticity as EMT is only just coming to light. This review will discuss 
      recent research on exosomal regulation of the EMT process in the tumor
      microenvironment.

TI  - Functions and Therapeutic Roles of Exosomes in Cancer.
LID - 127
AB  - The role of exosomes in cancer development has become the focus of much research,
      due to the many emerging roles possessed by exosomes. These micro-vesicles that
      are ubiquitously released in to the extracellular milieu, have been found to
      regulate immune system function, particularly in tumorigenesis, as well as
      conditioning future metastatic sites for the attachment and growth of tumor
      tissue. Through an interaction with a range of host tissue, exosomes are able to 
      generate a pro-tumor environment that is essential for carcinogenesis. Herein, we
      discuss the contents of exosomes and their contribution to tumorigenesis, as well
      as their role in chemotherapeutic resistance and the development of novel cancer 
      treatments and the identification of cancer biomarkers.

TI  - Current Concepts in Pediatric Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive Acute
      Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
LID - 54
AB  - The t(9;22)(q34;q11) or Philadelphia chromosome creates a BCR–ABL1 fusion gene
      encoding for a chimeric BCR–ABL1 protein. It is present in 3–4% of pediatric
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), and about 25% of adult ALL cases. Prior
      to the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), Ph+ ALL was associated with a 
      very poor prognosis despite the use of intensive chemotherapy and frequently
      hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission. The
      development of TKIs revolutionized the therapy of Ph+ ALL. Addition of the first 
      generation ABL1 class TKI imatinib to intensive chemotherapy dramatically
      increased the survival for children with Ph+ ALL and established that many
      patients can be cured without HSCT. In parallel, the mechanistic understanding of
      Ph+ ALL expanded exponentially through careful mapping of pathways downstream of 
      BCR–ABL1, the discovery of mutations in master regulators of B-cell development
      such as IKZF1 (Ikaros), PAX5, and early B-cell factor (EBF), the recognition of
      the complex clonal architecture of Ph+ ALL, and the delineation of genomic,
      epigenetic, and signaling abnormalities contributing to relapse and resistance.
      Still, many important basic and clinical questions remain unanswered. Current
      clinical trials are testing second generation TKIs in patients with newly
      diagnosed Ph+ ALL. Neither the optimal duration of therapy nor the optimal
      chemotherapy backbone are currently defined. The role of HSCT in first remission 
      and post-transplant TKI therapy also require further study. In addition, it will 
      be crucial to continue to dig deeper into understanding Ph+ ALL at a mechanistic 
      level, and translate findings into complementary targeted approaches. Expanding
      targeted therapies hold great promise to decrease toxicity and improve survival
      in this high-risk disease, which provides a paradigm for how targeted therapies
      can be incorporated into treatment of other high-risk leukemias.

LID - 38
AB  - Exosomes are secreted membrane vesicles that have been proposed as an effective
      means to detect a variety of disease states, including cancer. The properties of 
      exosomes, including stability in biological fluids, allow for their efficient
      isolation and make them an ideal vehicle for studies on early disease detection
      and evaluation. Much data has been collected over recent years regarding the
      messenger RNA, microRNA, and protein contents of exosomes. In addition, many
      studies have described the functional role that exosomes play in disease
      initiation and progression. Tumor cells have been shown to secrete exosomes,
      often in increased amounts compared to normal cells, and these exosomes can carry
      the genomic and proteomic signatures characteristic of the tumor cells from which
      they were derived. While these unique signatures make exosomes ideal for cancer
      detection, exosomes derived from cancer cells have also been shown to play a
      functional role in cancer progression. Here, we review the unique genomic and
      proteomic contents of exosomes originating from cancer cells as well as their
      functional effects to promote tumor progression.

      Cancer.
LID - 21
AB  - In multicellular organisms both health and disease are defined by patterns of
      communication between the constituent cells. In addition to networks of soluble
      mediators, cells are also programed to exchange complex messages pre-assembled as
      multimolecular cargo of membraneous structures known extracellular vesicles (EV).
      Several biogenetic pathways produce EVs with different properties, and known as
      exosomes, ectosomes, and apoptotic bodies. In cancer, EVs carry molecular
      signatures and effectors of the disease, such as mutant oncoproteins, oncogenic
      transcripts, microRNA, and DNA sequences. Intercellular trafficking of such EVs
      (oncosomes) may contribute to horizontal cellular transformation, phenotypic
      reprograming, and functional re-education of recipient cells, both locally and
      systemically. The EV-mediated, reciprocal molecular exchange also includes tumor 
      suppressors, phosphoproteins, proteases, growth factors, and bioactive lipids,
      all of which participate in the functional integration of multiple cells and
      their collective involvement in tumor angiogenesis, inflammation, immunity,
      coagulopathy, mobilization of bone marrow-derived effectors, metastasis, drug
      resistance, or cellular stemness. In cases where the EV role is rate limiting
      their production and uptake may represent and unexplored anticancer therapy
      target. Moreover, oncosomes circulating in biofluids of cancer patients offer an 
      unprecedented, remote, and non-invasive access to crucial molecular information
      about cancer cells, including their driver mutations, classifiers, molecular
      subtypes, therapeutic targets, and biomarkers of drug resistance. New
      nanotechnologies are being developed to exploit this unique biomarker platform.
      Indeed, embracing the notion that human cancers are defined not only by processes
      occurring within cancer cells, but also between them, and amidst the altered
      tumor and systemic microenvironment may open new diagnostic and therapeutic
      opportunities.

TI  - Regulation of Sirtuin Function by Posttranslational Modifications.
LID - 29
AB  - Sirtuins are homologs of the yeast silencing information regulator 2 protein, an 
      NAD+-dependent (histone) deacetylase. In mammals seven different sirtuins,
      SIRT1–7, have been identified, which share a common catalytic core domain but
      possess distinct N- and C-terminal extensions. This core domain elicits
      NAD+-dependent deacetylase and in some cases also ADP-ribosyltransferase,
      demalonylase, and desuccinylase activities. Sirtuins have been implicated in key 
      cellular processes, including cell survival, autophagy, apoptosis, gene
      transcription, DNA repair, stress response, and genome stability. In addition
      some sirtuins are associated with disease, including cancer and
      neurodegeneration. These findings suggest strongly that sirtuins are tightly
      controlled and potentially responsive to different signal transduction pathways. 
      Here, we review the posttranslational regulation mechanisms of mammalian sirtuins
      and discuss their relevance regarding the physiological processes, with which the
      different sirtuins are associated. The available data suggest that the N- and
      C-terminal extensions are the targets of posttranslational modifications (PTM)
      that can affect the functions of sirtuins. Mechanistically this can be explained 
      by the interaction of these extensions with the catalytic core domain, which
      appears to be controlled by PTM at least in some cases. In contrast little is
      known about PTM and regulation of the catalytic domain itself. Together these
      findings point to key regulatory roles of the N- and C-terminal extensions in
      controlling sirtuin functions, thus connecting these regulators to different
      signaling pathways.

      markers of stress tolerance.
LID - 711
AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum; T. durum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) agricultural
      production is severely limited by various abiotic and biotic stress factors.
      Proteins are directly involved in plant stress response so it is important to
      study proteome changes under various stress conditions. Generally, both abiotic
      and biotic stress factors induce profound alterations in protein network covering
      signaling, energy metabolism (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, ATP biosynthesis,
      photosynthesis), storage proteins, protein metabolism, several other biosynthetic
      pathways (e.g., S-adenosylmethionine metabolism, lignin metabolism), transport
      proteins, proteins involved in protein folding and chaperone activities, other
      protective proteins (LEA, PR proteins), ROS scavenging enzymes as well as
      proteins affecting regulation of plant growth and development. Proteins which
      have been reported to reveal significant differences in their relative abundance 
      or posttranslational modifications between wheat, barley or related species
      genotypes under stress conditions are listed and their potential role in
      underlying the differential stress response is discussed. In conclusion,
      potential future roles of the results of proteomic studies in practical
      applications such as breeding for an enhanced stress tolerance and the
      possibilities to test and use protein markers in the breeding are suggested.

TI  - Clinical proteomics of myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 41
AB  - Myeloid leukemias are a heterogeneous group of diseases originating from bone
      marrow myeloid progenitor cells. Patients with myeloid leukemias can achieve
      long-term survival through targeted therapy, cure after intensive chemotherapy or
      short-term survival because of highly chemoresistant disease. Therefore, despite 
      the development of advanced molecular diagnostics, there is an unmet need for
      efficient therapy that reflects the advanced diagnostics. Although the molecular 
      design of therapeutic agents is aimed at interacting with specific proteins
      identified through molecular diagnostics, the majority of therapeutic agents act 
      on multiple protein targets. Ongoing studies on the leukemic cell proteome will
      probably identify a large number of new biomarkers, and the prediction of
      response to therapy through these markers is an interesting avenue for future
      personalized medicine. Mass spectrometric protein detection is a fundamental
      technique in clinical proteomics, and selected tools are presented, including
      stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), isobaric tags
      for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) and multiple reaction monitoring
      (MRM), as well as single cell determination. We suggest that protein analysis
      will play not only a supplementary, but also a prominent role in future molecular
      diagnostics, and we outline how accurate knowledge of the molecular therapeutic
      targets can be used to monitor therapy response.

TI  - Angiotensin II Regulates microRNA-132/-212 in Hypertensive Rats and Humans.
PG  - 11190-207
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs that fine tune translation
      of multiple target mRNAs, are emerging as key regulators in cardiovascular
      development and disease. MiRNAs are involved in cardiac hypertrophy, heart
      failure and remodeling following cardiac infarction; however, miRNAs involved in 
      hypertension have not been thoroughly investigated. We have recently reported
      that specific miRNAs play an integral role in Angiotensin II receptor (AT1R)
      signaling, especially after activation of the Gαq signaling pathway. Since AT1R
      blockers are widely used to treat hypertension, we undertook a detailed analysis 
      of potential miRNAs involved in Angiotensin II (AngII) mediated hypertension in
      rats and hypertensive patients, using miRNA microarray and qPCR analysis. The
      miR-132 and miR-212 are highly increased in the heart, aortic wall and kidney of 
      rats with hypertension (159 ± 12 mm Hg) and cardiac hypertrophy following chronic
      AngII infusion. In addition, activation of the endothelin receptor, another Gαq
      coupled receptor, also increased miR-132 and miR-212. We sought to extend these
      observations using human samples by reasoning that AT1R blockers may decrease
      miR-132 and miR-212. We analyzed tissue samples of mammary artery obtained from
      surplus arterial tissue after coronary bypass operations. Indeed, we found a
      decrease in expression levels of miR-132 and miR-212 in human arteries from
      bypass-operated patients treated with AT1R blockers, whereas treatment with
      β-blockers had no effect. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-132 and
      miR-212 are involved in AngII induced hypertension, providing a new perspective
      in hypertensive disease mechanisms.

TI  - Mitogen-Activated Protein (MAP) Kinase Scaffolding Proteins: A Recount.
PG  - 4854-84
AB  - The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is the canonical signaling
      pathway for many receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor. Downstream of the receptors, this pathway involves the activation of a 
      kinase cascade that culminates in a transcriptional response and affects
      processes, such as cell migration and adhesion. In addition, the strength and
      duration of the upstream signal also influence the mode of the cellular response 
      that is switched on. Thus, the same components can in principle coordinate
      opposite responses, such as proliferation and differentiation. In recent years,
      it has become evident that MAPK signaling is regulated and fine-tuned by proteins
      that can bind to several MAPK signaling proteins simultaneously and, thereby,
      affect their function. These so-called MAPK scaffolding proteins are, thus,
      important coordinators of the signaling response in cells. In this review, we
      summarize the recent advances in the research on MAPK/extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway scaffolders. We will not only review the
      well-known members of the family, such as kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), but
      also put a special focus on the function of the recently identified or less
      studied scaffolders, such as fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2,
      flotillin-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase organizer 1.

TI  - Quantitative Profiling of DNA Damage and Apoptotic Pathways in UV Damaged Cells
      Using PTMScan Direct.
PG  - 286-307
AB  - Traditional methods for analysis of peptides using liquid chromatography and
      tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) lack the specificity to comprehensively
      monitor specific biological processes due to the inherent duty cycle limitations 
      of the MS instrument and the stochastic nature of the analytical platform.
      PTMScan Direct is a novel, antibody-based method that allows quantitative
      LC-MS/MS profiling of specific peptides from proteins that reside in the same
      signaling pathway. New PTMScan Direct reagents have been produced that target
      peptides from proteins involved in DNA Damage/Cell Cycle and Apoptosis/Autophagy 
      pathways. Together, the reagents provide access to 438 sites on 237 proteins in
      these signaling cascades. These reagents have been used to profile the response
      to UV damage of DNA in human cell lines. UV damage was shown to activate
      canonical DNA damage response pathways through ATM/ATR-dependent signaling,
      stress response pathways and induce the initiation of apoptosis, as assessed by
      an increase in the abundance of peptides corresponding to cleaved, activated
      caspases. These data demonstrate the utility of PTMScan Direct as a multiplexed
      assay for profiling specific cellular responses to various stimuli, such as UV
      damage of DNA.

TI  - The Proteomics Big Challenge for Biomarkers and New Drug-Targets Discovery.
PG  - 13926-48
AB  - In the modern process of drug discovery, clinical, functional and chemical
      proteomics can converge and integrate synergies. Functional proteomics explores
      and elucidates the components of pathways and their interactions which, when
      deregulated, lead to a disease condition. This knowledge allows the design of
      strategies to target multiple pathways with combinations of pathway-specific
      drugs, which might increase chances of success and reduce the occurrence of drug 
      resistance. Chemical proteomics, by analyzing the drug interactome, strongly
      contributes to accelerate the process of new druggable targets discovery. In the 
      research area of clinical proteomics, proteome and peptidome mass
      spectrometry-profiling of human bodily fluid (plasma, serum, urine and so on), as
      well as of tissue and of cells, represents a promising tool for novel biomarker
      and eventually new druggable targets discovery. In the present review we provide 
      a survey of current strategies of functional, chemical and clinical proteomics.
      Major issues will be presented for proteomic technologies used for the discovery 
      of biomarkers for early disease diagnosis and identification of new drug targets.

AB  - Massive evidence suggests that genetic abnormalities contribute to the
      development of lung cancer. These molecular abnormalities may serve as
      diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers for this deadly disease. It is
      imperative to search these biomarkers in different tumorigenesis pathways so as
      to provide the most appropriate therapy for each individual patient with lung
      malignancy. Phosphoproteomics is a promising technology for the identification of
      biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for cancer. Thousands of proteins
      interact via physical and chemical association. Moreover, some proteins can
      covalently modify other proteins post-translationally. These post-translational
      modifications ultimately give rise to the emergent functions of cells in
      sequence, space and time. Phosphoproteomics clinical researches imply the
      comprehensive analysis of the proteins that are expressed in cells or tissues and
      can be employed at different stages. In addition, understanding the functions of 
      phosphorylated proteins requires the study of proteomes as linked systems rather 
      than collections of individual protein molecules. In fact, proteomics approaches 
      coupled with affinity chromatography strategies followed by mass spectrometry
      have been used to elucidate relevant biological questions. This article will
      discuss the relevant clues of post-translational modifications, phosphorylated
      proteins, and useful proteomics approaches to identify molecular cancer
      signatures. The recent progress in phosphoproteomics research in lung cancer will
      be also discussed.

TI  - Human Gene Control by Vital Oncogenes: Revisiting a Theoretical Model and Its
      Implications for Targeted Cancer Therapy.
PG  - 316-35
AB  - An important assumption of our current understanding of the mechanisms of
      carcinogenesis has been the belief that clarification of the cancer process would
      inevitably reveal some of the crucial mechanisms of normal human gene regulation.
      Since the momentous work of Bishop and Varmus, both the molecular and the
      biochemical processes underlying the events in the development of cancer have
      become increasingly clear. The identification of cellular signaling pathways and 
      the role of protein kinases in the events leading to gene activation have been
      critical to our understanding not only of normal cellular gene control
      mechanisms, but also have clarified some of the important molecular and
      biochemical events occurring within a cancer cell. We now know that oncogenes are
      dysfunctional proto-oncogenes and that dysfunctional tumor suppressor genes
      contribute to the cancer process. Furthermore, Weinstein and others have
      hypothesized the phenomenon of oncogene addiction as a distinct characteristic of
      the malignant cell. It can be assumed that cancer cells, indeed, become dependent
      on such vital oncogenes. The products of these vital oncogenes, such as c-myc,
      may well be the Achilles heel by which targeted molecular therapy may lead to
      truly personalized cancer therapy. The remaining problem is the need to introduce
      relevant molecular diagnostic tests such as genome microarray analysis and
      proteomic methods, especially protein kinase identification arrays, for each
      individual patient. Genome wide association studies on cancers with gene analysis
      of single nucleotide and other mutations in functional proto-oncogenes will,
      hopefully, identify dysfunctional proto-oncogenes and allow the development of
      more specific targeted drugs directed against the protein products of these vital
      oncogenes. In 1984 Willis proposed a molecular and biochemical model for
      eukaryotic gene regulation suggesting how proto-oncogenes might function within
      the normal cell. That model predicted the existence of vital oncogenes and can
      now be used to hypothesize the biochemical and molecular mechanisms that drive
      the processes leading to disruption of the gene regulatory machinery, resulting
      in the transformation of normal cells into cancer.

TI  - Yeast Two-Hybrid, a Powerful Tool for Systems Biology.
PG  - 2763-88
AB  - A key property of complex biological systems is the presence of interaction
      networks formed by its different components, primarily proteins. These are
      crucial for all levels of cellular function, including architecture, metabolism
      and signalling, as well as the availability of cellular energy. Very stable, but 
      also rather transient and dynamic protein-protein interactions generate new
      system properties at the level of multiprotein complexes, cellular compartments
      or the entire cell. Thus, interactomics is expected to largely contribute to
      emerging fields like systems biology or systems bioenergetics. The more recent
      technological development of high-throughput methods for interactomics research
      will dramatically increase our knowledge of protein interaction networks. The two
      most frequently used methods are yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening, a well
      established genetic in vivo approach, and affinity purification of complexes
      followed by mass spectrometry analysis, an emerging biochemical in vitro
      technique. So far, a majority of published interactions have been detected using 
      an Y2H screen. However, with the massive application of this method, also some
      limitations have become apparent. This review provides an overview on available
      yeast two-hybrid methods, in particular focusing on more recent approaches. These
      allow detection of protein interactions in their native environment, as e.g. in
      the cytosol or bound to a membrane, by using cytosolic signalling cascades or
      split protein constructs. Strengths and weaknesses of these genetic methods are
      discussed and some guidelines for verification of detected protein-protein
      interactions are provided.

TI  - Analyses of the combination of 6-MP and dasatinib in cell culture.
PG  - 13-22
AB  - A major tenet of cancer therapeutics is that combinations of anticancer agents
      with different mechanisms of action and different toxicities may be effective
      treatment regimens. Evaluation of additivity/synergy in cell culture may be used 
      to identify drug combination opportunities and to assess risk of
      additive/synergistic toxicity. The combination of 6-mercaptopurine and dasatinib 
      was assessed for additivity/synergy using the combination index (CI) method and a
      response surface method in six human tumor cell lines including MCF-7 and
      MDA-MB-468 breast cancer, NCI-H23 and NCI-H460 non-small cell lung cancer, and
      A498 and 786-O renal cell cancer, based on two experimental end-points: ATP
      content and colony formation. Clonal colony formation by human bone marrow CFU-GM
      was used to assess risk of enhanced toxicity. The concentration ranges tested for
      each drug were selected to encompass the clinical Cmax concentrations. The
      combination regimens were found to be additive to sub-additive by both methods of
      data analysis, but synergy was not detected. The non-small cell lung cancer cell 
      lines were the most responsive among the tumor lines tested and the renal cell
      carcinoma lines were the least responsive. The bone marrows CFU-GM were more
      sensitive to the combination regimens than were the tumor cell lines. Based upon 
      these data, it appears that the possibility of enhanced efficacy from combining
      6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and dasatinib would be associated with increased risk of 
      severe bone marrow toxicity, so the combination is unlikely to provide a
      therapeutic advantage for treating solid tumor patients where adequate bone
      marrow function must be preserved.

TI  - Mitochondrial Acetylation and Diseases of Aging.
LID - 234875
AB  - In recent years, protein lysine acetylation has emerged as a prominent and
      conserved regulatory posttranslational modification that is abundant on numerous 
      enzymes involved in the processes of intermediary metabolism. Well-characterized 
      mitochondrial processes of carbon utilization are enriched in acetyl-lysine
      modifications. Although seminal discoveries have been made in the basic biology
      of mitochondrial acetylation, an understanding of how acetylation states
      influence enzyme function and metabolic reprogramming during pathological states 
      remains largely unknown. This paper will examine our current understanding of
      eukaryotic acetate metabolism and present recent findings in the field of
      mitochondrial acetylation biology. The implications of mitochondrial acetylation 
      for the aging process will be discussed, as well as its potential implications
      for the unique and localized metabolic states that occur during the
      aging-associated conditions of heart failure and cancer growth.

TI  - Implications of tyrosine phosphoproteomics in cervical carcinogenesis.
PG  - 2
AB  - Background: Worldwide cervical cancer remains a leading cause of mortality from
      gynecologic malignancies. The link between cervical cancer and persistent
      infection with HPV has been established. At a molecular level little is known
      about the transition from the precancerous state to invasive cancer. To elucidate
      this process, cervical biopsies from human specimens were obtained from
      precancerous state to stage III disease. Methods: Cervical biopsies were obtained
      from patients with a diagnosis of cervical cancer undergoing definitive surgery
      or staging operation. Biopsies were obtained from patients with precancerous
      lesions at the time of their excisional procedure. Control samples were obtained 
      from patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions such as fibroids.
      Samples were subjected to proteomic profiling using two dimensional gel
      electrophoresis with subsequent trypsin digestion followed by MALDI-TOF protein
      identification. Candidate proteins were then further studied using western
      blotting, immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry. Results: Annexin A1 and
      DNA-PKcs were found to be differentially expressed. Phosphorylated annexin A1 was
      up regulated in diseased states in comparison to control and its level was
      strongly detected in the serum of cervical cancer patients compared to controls. 
      DNA-PKcs was noted to be hyperphosphorylated and fragmented in cancer when
      compared to controls. By immunohistochemistry annexin A1 was noted in the
      vascular environment in cancer and certain precancerous samples. Conclusion: This
      study suggests a probable role for protein tyrosine phosphorylation in cervical
      carcinogenesis. Annexin A1 and DNA-PK cs may have synergistic effects with HPV
      infection. Precancerous lesions that may progress to cervical cancer may be
      differentiated from lesions that will not base on similar immunohistochemical
      profile to invasive squamous cell carcinoma.

TI  - Biological properties of extracellular vesicles and their physiological
      functions.
LID - 10.3402/jev.v4.27066
AB  - In the past decade, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been recognized as potent
      vehicles of intercellular communication, both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This
      is due to their capacity to transfer proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, thereby 
      influencing various physiological and pathological functions of both recipient
      and parent cells. While intensive investigation has targeted the role of EVs in
      different pathological processes, for example, in cancer and autoimmune diseases,
      the EV-mediated maintenance of homeostasis and the regulation of physiological
      functions have remained less explored. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview 
      of the current understanding of the physiological roles of EVs, which has been
      written by crowd-sourcing, drawing on the unique EV expertise of academia-based
      scientists, clinicians and industry based in 27 European countries, the United
      States and Australia. This review is intended to be of relevance to both
      researchers already working on EV biology and to newcomers who will encounter
      this universal cell biological system. Therefore, here we address the molecular
      contents and functions of EVs in various tissues and body fluids from cell
      systems to organs. We also review the physiological mechanisms of EVs in
      bacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants to highlight the functional uniformity of
      this emerging communication system.

TI  - Nanotopographical Control of Stem Cell Differentiation.
LID - 120623
AB  - Stem cells have the capacity to differentiate into various lineages, and the
      ability to reliably direct stem cell fate determination would have tremendous
      potential for basic research and clinical therapy. Nanotopography provides a
      useful tool for guiding differentiation, as the features are more durable than
      surface chemistry and can be modified in size and shape to suit the desired
      application. In this paper, nanotopography is examined as a means to guide
      differentiation, and its application is described in the context of different
      subsets of stem cells, with a particular focus on skeletal (mesenchymal) stem
      cells. To address the mechanistic basis underlying the topographical effects on
      stem cells, the likely contributions of indirect (biochemical signal-mediated)
      and direct (force-mediated) mechanotransduction are discussed. Data from
      proteomic research is also outlined in relation to topography-mediated fate
      determination, as this approach provides insight into the global molecular
      changes at the level of the functional effectors.

TI  - Identification and proteomic profiling of exosomes in human cerebrospinal fluid.
PG  - 5
AB  - Background: Exosomes are released from multiple cell types, contain protein and
      RNA species, and have been exploited as a novel reservoir for disease biomarker
      discovery. They can transfer information between cells and may cause pathology,
      for example, a role for exosomes has been proposed in the pathophysiology of
      Alzheimer's disease. Although studied in several biofluids, exosomes have not
      been extensively studied in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from humans. The
      objective of this study was to determine: 1) whether human CSF contains exosomes 
      and 2) the variability in exosomal protein content across individuals. Methods:
      CSF was collected from 5 study participants undergoing thoraco-abdominal aortic
      aneurysm repair (around 200 - 500 ml per participant) and low-density membrane
      vesicles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The presence of exosomes was
      determined by western blot for marker proteins, isopycnic centrifugation on a
      sucrose step gradient and transmission electron microscopy with immuno-labelling.
      Whole protein profiling was performed using Fourier transform ion cyclotron
      resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR). Results: Flotillin 1 and tumor
      susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), two exosomal marker proteins, were identified
      in the ultracentrifugation pellet using western blot. These markers localized to 
      a density consistent with exosomes following isopycnic centrifugation.
      Transmission electron microscopy visualized structures consistent with exosomes
      in size and appearance that labelled positive for flotillin 1. Therefore, the
      pellet that resulted from ultracentrifugation of human CSF contained exosomes.
      FT-ICR profiling of this pellet was performed and 84-161 ions were detected per
      study participant. Around one third of these ions were only present in a single
      study participant and one third were detected in all five. With regard to ion
      quantity, the median coefficient of variation was 81% for ions detected in two or
      more samples. Conclusions: Exosomes were identified in human CSF and their
      proteome is a potential new reservoir for biomarker discovery in neurological
      disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. However, techniques used to concentrate
      exosomes from CSF need refinement to reduce variability. In this study we used
      relatively large starting volumes of human CSF, future studies will focus on
      exosome isolation from smaller 'real life' clinical samples; a key challenge in
      the development of exosomes as translational tools.

TI  - Role of SIRT3 in the regulation of redox balance during oral carcinogenesis.
PG  - 68
AB  - Background: Sirtuins (SIRT1-7) are a family of NAD-dependent deacetylases, which 
      play an important role in regulating cancer tumorigenesis; however, their role in
      oral cancer has been controversial. SIRT3 is localized in the mitochondria, where
      it deacetylates and activates several enzymes involved in cellular redox balance 
      and defense against oxidative damage. Results: We found that compared with normal
      human oral keratinocytes (HOK), SIRT3 is highly expressed in oral squamous cell
      carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines, but the enzymatic deacetylation is significantly
      reduced. We also sequenced the entire coding region of SIRT3 and found the same
      mutation in 2 different OSCC cell lines. This point mutation is located in close 
      proximity to the active site of deacetylase in the SIRT3 protein, and reduces the
      overall enzymatic efficiency of deacetylation. Furthermore, up-regulation of
      SIRT3 inhibited the cell growth of OSCCs and decreased the levels of basal
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both OSCC lines. To verify that the SIRT3
      sequence variation was associated with oral carcinogenesis, we sequenced the
      SIRT3 gene from 21 OSCC patients, and 5 of the 21 patients (23.8%) carried the
      heterozygous missense mutation, p.Val208Ile. The heterozygous missense mutation
      in these patients was present in gremlin DNA isolated from both normal and tumor 
      tissues. Conclusions: Our findings provide a valuable insight into the potential 
      role of SIRT3 in the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma, by showing that
      a non-synonymous point mutation in SIRT3 contributes to reduced catalytic
      activity of the protein and affects redox balance in OSCCs.

TI  - Dasatinib reduces FAK phosphorylation increasing the effects of RPI-1 inhibition 
      in a RET/PTC1-expressing cell line.
PG  - 278
AB  - Background: TPC-1 is a papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC)-derived cell line that
      spontaneously expresses the oncogene RET/PTC1. TPC-1 treated with the RET/PTC1
      inhibitor RPI-1 displayed a cytostatic and reversible inhibition of cell
      proliferation and a strong activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). As
      dasatinib inhibition of Src results in reduction of FAK activation, we evaluated 
      the effects of TPC-1 treatment with dasatinib in combination with RPI-1. Results:
      Dasatinib (100 nM) strongly reduced TPC-1 proliferation and induced marked
      changes in TPC-1 morphology. Cells appeared smaller and more contracted, with
      decreased cell spreading, due to the inhibition of phosphorylation of important
      cytoskeletal proteins (p130CAS, Crk, and paxillin) by dasatinib. The combination 
      of RPI-1 with dasatinib demonstrated enhanced effects on cell proliferation (more
      than 80% reduction) and on the phosphotyrosine protein profile. In particular,
      RPI-1 reduced the phosphorylation of RET, MET, DCDB2, CTND1, and PLCγ, while
      dasatinib acted on the phosphorylation of EGFR, EPHA2, and DOK1. Moreover,
      dasatinib completely abrogated the phosphorylation of FAK at all tyrosine sites
      (Y576, Y577, Y861, Y925) with the exception of the autoactivation site (Y397).
      Notably, the pharmacological treatments induced an overexpression of integrin β1 
      (ITB1) that was correlated with a mild enhancement in phosphorylation of ERK1/2
      and STAT3, known for their roles in prevention of apoptosis and in increase of
      proliferation and survival. A reduction in Akt, p38 and JNK1/2 activation was
      observed. Conclusions: All data demonstrate that the combination of the two drugs
      effectively reduced cell proliferation (by more than 80%), significantly
      decreased Tyr phosphorylation of almost all phosphorylable proteins, and altered 
      the morphology of the cells, supporting high cytostatic effects. Following the
      combined treatment, cell survival pathways appeared to be mediated by STAT3 and
      ERK activities resulting from integrin clustering and FAK autophosphorylation.
      EphA2 may also contribute, at least in part, to integrin and FAK activation. In
      conclusion, these data implicate ITB1 and EphA2 as promising therapeutic targets 
      in PTC.

TI  - Differential genetic interactions of yeast stress response MAPK pathways.
LID - 800
AB  - Genetic interaction screens have been applied with great success in several
      organisms to study gene function and the genetic architecture of the cell.
      However, most studies have been performed under optimal growth conditions even
      though many functional interactions are known to occur under specific cellular
      conditions. In this study, we have performed a large-scale genetic interaction
      analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae involving approximately 49 × 1,200 double
      mutants in the presence of five different stress conditions, including osmotic,
      oxidative and cell wall-altering stresses. This resulted in the generation of a
      differential E-MAP (or dE-MAP) comprising over 250,000 measurements of
      conditional interactions. We found an extensive number of conditional genetic
      interactions that recapitulate known stress-specific functional associations.
      Furthermore, we have also uncovered previously unrecognized roles involving the
      phosphatase regulator Bud14, the histone methylation complex COMPASS and membrane
      trafficking complexes in modulating the cell wall integrity pathway. Finally, the
      osmotic stress differential genetic interactions showed enrichment for genes
      coding for proteins with conditional changes in phosphorylation but not for genes
      with conditional changes in gene expression. This suggests that conditional
      genetic interactions are a powerful tool to dissect the functional importance of 
      the different response mechanisms of the cell.

TI  - Targeting a cell state common to triple-negative breast cancers.
LID - 789
AB  - Some mutations in cancer cells can be exploited for therapeutic intervention.
      However, for many cancer subtypes, including triple-negative breast cancer
      (TNBC), no frequently recurring aberrations could be identified to make such an
      approach clinically feasible. Characterized by a highly heterogeneous mutational 
      landscape with few common features, many TNBCs cluster together based on their
      ‘basal-like’ transcriptional profiles. We therefore hypothesized that targeting
      TNBC cells on a systems level by exploiting the transcriptional cell state might 
      be a viable strategy to find novel therapies for this highly aggressive disease. 
      We performed a large-scale chemical genetic screen and identified a group of
      compounds related to the drug PKC412 (midostaurin). PKC412 induced apoptosis in a
      subset of TNBC cells enriched for the basal-like subtype and inhibited tumor
      growth in vivo. We employed a multi-omics approach and computational modeling to 
      address the mechanism of action and identified spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) as a 
      novel and unexpected target in TNBC. Quantitative phosphoproteomics revealed that
      SYK inhibition abrogates signaling to STAT3, explaining the selectivity for
      basal-like breast cancer cells. This non-oncogene addiction suggests that
      chemical SYK inhibition may be beneficial for a specific subset of TNBC patients 
      and demonstrates that targeting cell states could be a viable strategy to
      discover novel treatment strategies.

TI  - Harmonic oscillator model of the insulin and IGF1 receptors' allosteric binding
      and activation.
PG  - 243
AB  - The insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors activate overlapping
      signalling pathways that are critical for growth, metabolism, survival and
      longevity. Their mechanism of ligand binding and activation displays complex
      allosteric properties, which no mathematical model has been able to account for. 
      Modelling these receptors' binding and activation in terms of interactions
      between the molecular components is problematical due to many unknown biochemical
      and structural details. Moreover, substantial combinatorial complexity
      originating from multivalent ligand binding further complicates the problem. On
      the basis of the available structural and biochemical information, we develop a
      physically plausible model of the receptor binding and activation, which is based
      on the concept of a harmonic oscillator. Modelling a network of interactions
      among all possible receptor intermediaries arising in the context of the model
      (35, for the insulin receptor) accurately reproduces for the first time all the
      kinetic properties of the receptor, and provides unique and robust estimates of
      the kinetic parameters. The harmonic oscillator model may be adaptable for many
      other dimeric/dimerizing receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors and
      G-protein-coupled receptors where ligand crosslinking occurs.

      analysis of the in vivo phosphoproteomics profiles of human normal and
      cataractous lenses with the aim of identifying specific phosphorylation sites
      which may provide insights into the physiologic significance of phosphorylation
      in relation to cataract formation. Methods: To improve detection sensitivity of
      low abundant proteins, we first adopted SDS-gel electrophoresis fractionation of 
      lens extracts to identify and compare the protein compositions between normal and
      cataractous lenses, followed by tryptic digestion, enrichment of phosphopeptides 
      by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and nano-liquid
      chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) analysis. Results:
      By comprehensively screening of the phosphoproteome in normal and cataractous
      lenses, we identified 32 phosphoproteins and 73 phosphorylated sites. The most
      abundantly phosphorylated proteins are two subunits of β-crystallin, i.e.,
      βB1-crystallin (12%) and βB2-crystallin (12%). Moreover, serine was found to be
      the most abundantly phosphorylated residue (72%) in comparison with threonine
      (24%) and tyrosine (4%) in the lens phosphoproteome. The quantitative analysis
      revealed significant and distinct changes of 19 phosphoproteins corresponding to 
      28 phosphorylated sites between these two types of human lenses, including 20
      newly discovered novel phosphorylation sites on lens proteins. Conclusions: The
      shotgun phosphoproteomics approach to characterize protein phosphorylation may be
      adapted and extended to the comprehensive analysis of other types of
      post-translational modification of lens proteins in vivo. The identification of
      these novel phosphorylation sites in lens proteins that showed differential
      expression in the cataractous lens may bear some unknown physiologic significance
      and provide insights into phosphorylation-related human eye diseases, which
      warrant further investigation in the future.

AB  - Most cancers are characterized by multiple molecular alterations, but
      identification of the key proteins involved in these signaling pathways is
      currently beyond reach. We show that the inhibitor PU-H71 preferentially targets 
      tumor-enriched Hsp90 complexes and affinity captures Hsp90-dependent oncogenic
      client proteins. We have used PU-H71 affinity capture to design a proteomic
      approach that, when combined with bioinformatic pathway analysis, identifies
      dysregulated signaling networks and key oncoproteins in chronic myeloid leukemia.
      The identified interactome overlaps with the well-characterized altered proteome 
      in this cancer, indicating that this method can provide global insights into the 
      biology of individual tumors, including primary patient specimens. In addition,
      we show that this approach can be used to identify previously uncharacterized
      oncoproteins and mechanisms, potentially leading to new targeted therapies. We
      further show that the abundance of the PU-H71-enriched Hsp90 species, which is
      not dictated by Hsp90 expression alone, is predictive of the cell’s sensitivity
      to Hsp90 inhibition.

      signalling.
LID - 6265
AB  - Cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion is a fundamental requirement for
      multicellular existence due to roles in positioning, proliferation and
      differentiation. Phosphorylation plays a major role in adhesion signalling;
      however, a full understanding of the phosphorylation events that occur at sites
      of adhesion is lacking. Here we report a proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis 
      of adhesion complexes isolated from cells spread on fibronectin. We identify
      1,174 proteins, 499 of which are phosphorylated (1,109 phosphorylation sites),
      including both well-characterized and novel adhesion-regulated phosphorylation
      events. Immunoblotting suggests that two classes of phosphorylated residues are
      found at adhesion sites—those induced by adhesion and those constitutively
      phosphorylated but recruited in response to adhesion. Kinase prediction analysis 
      identifies novel kinases with putative roles in adhesion signalling including
      CDK1, inhibition of which reduces adhesion complex formation. This
      phospho-adhesome data set constitutes a valuable resource to improve our
      understanding of the signalling mechanisms through which cell–ECM interactions
      control cell behaviour.

TI  - Activation of diverse signaling pathways by oncogenic PIK3CA mutations.
PG  - 4961
AB  - The PIK3CA gene is frequently mutated in human cancers. Here we carry out a
      SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis using isogenic knockin cell
      lines containing ‘driver’ oncogenic mutations of PIK3CA to dissect the signaling 
      mechanisms responsible for oncogenic phenotypes induced by mutant PIK3CA. From
      8,075 unique phosphopeptides identified, we observe that aberrant activation of
      PI3K pathway leads to increased phosphorylation of a surprisingly wide variety of
      kinases and downstream signaling networks. Here, by integrating phosphoproteomic 
      data with human protein microarray-based AKT1 kinase assays, we discover and
      validate six novel AKT1 substrates, including cortactin. Through mutagenesis
      studies, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of cortactin by AKT1 is important
      for mutant PI3K enhanced cell migration and invasion. Our study describes a
      quantitative and global approach for identifying mutation-specific signaling
      events and for discovering novel signaling molecules as readouts of pathway
      activation or potential therapeutic targets.

TI  - The nuclear envelope environment and its cancer connections.
PG  - 196-209
AB  - Because of the association between aberrant nuclear structure and tumour grade,
      nuclear morphology is an indispensible criterion in the current pathological
      assessment of cancer. Components of the nuclear envelope environment have central
      roles in many aspects of cell function that affect tumour development and
      progression. As the roles of the nuclear envelope components, including nuclear
      pore complexes and nuclear lamina, are being deciphered in molecular detail there
      are opportunities to harness this knowledge for cancer therapeutics and biomarker
      development. In this Review, we summarize the progress that has been made in our 
      understanding of the nuclear envelope and the implications of changes in this
      environment for cancer biology.

TI  - NuRD: A multi-faceted chromatin remodeling complex in regulating cancer biology.
PG  - 588-96
AB  - The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD; also known as Mi-2) complex
      regulates gene expression at the level of chromatin. The NuRD complex has been
      identified – using both genetic and molecular analyses – as a key determinant of 
      differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells and during development in various
      model systems. Similar to other chromatin remodelers, such as SWI/SNF and
      polycomb complexes, NuRD has also been implicated in the regulation of
      transcriptional events integral to oncogenesis and cancer progression. Emerging
      molecular details regarding recruitment of NuRD to specific loci during
      development and modulation of these events in cancer are used to illustrate how
      inappropriate localization of the complex could contribute to tumor biology.

TI  - The role of AXL and the in vitro activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor BGB324 in Ewing sarcoma.
PG  - 12753-68
AB  - New targets for Ewing sarcoma (ES) patients are urgently needed. Therefore, we
      investigated the expression and genetic aberrations of the oncogenic receptor
      tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL in ES and determined the efficacy of AXL targeting on
      cell viability and migration. First, AXL and Gas6 (ligand) mRNA expression was
      determined by RT-PCR on 29 ES samples. Low, medium and high AXL mRNA expression
      was observed in 31% (n = 9), 48% (n = 14) and 21% (n = 6) of samples. Gas6 was
      abundantly present in all specimens. We next tested AXL protein expression
      immunohistochemically in 36 tumors (primary, post-chemotherapy, metastasized and 
      relapsed samples) from 25 ES patients. Low, medium and high AXL protein
      expression was observed in 17% (n = 6), 19% (n = 7) and 36% (n = 13) of samples. 
      In primary tumors (n = 15), high AXL expression correlated significantly with a
      worse overall survival compared to patients with lower expression (61 vs. 194
      months, p = 0.026). No genetic aberrations were detected in the AXL RTK domain (n
      = 29). The AXL-inhibitor BGB324 affected viability (IC50 0.79–2.13 μmol/L) and
      migratory potential of all tested ES cell lines in vitro (n = 5–6). BGB324
      chemosensitized chemotherapy-resistant ES-4 cells to vincristine and doxorubicin.
      These data suggest that AXL is a potential novel, druggable therapeutic target in
      ES.

TI  - Axl as a mediator of cellular growth and survival.
PG  - 8818-52
AB  - The control of cellular growth and proliferation is key to the maintenance of
      homeostasis. Survival, proliferation, and arrest are regulated, in part, by
      Growth Arrest Specific 6 (Gas6) through binding to members of the TAM receptor
      tyrosine kinase family. Activation of the TAM receptors leads to downstream
      signaling through common kinases, but the exact mechanism within each cellular
      context varies and remains to be completely elucidated. Deregulation of the TAM
      family, due to its central role in mediating cellular proliferation, has been
      implicated in multiple diseases. Axl was cloned as the first TAM receptor in a
      search for genes involved in the progression of chronic to acute-phase leukemia, 
      and has since been established as playing a critical role in the progression of
      cancer. The oncogenic nature of Axl is demonstrated through its activation of
      signaling pathways involved in proliferation, migration, inhibition of apoptosis,
      and therapeutic resistance. Despite its recent discovery, significant progress
      has been made in the development of effective clinical therapeutics targeting
      Axl. In order to accurately define the role of Axl in normal and diseased
      processes, it must be analyzed in a cell type-specific context.

TI  - AXL kinase as a novel target for cancer therapy.
PG  - 9546-63
AB  - The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase and its major ligand, GAS6 have been
      demonstrated to be overexpressed and activated in many human cancers (such as
      lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer) and have been correlated with poor
      prognosis, promotion of increased invasiveness/metastasis, the EMT phenotype and 
      drug resistance. Targeting AXL in different model systems with specific small
      molecule kinase inhibitors or antibodies alone or in combination with other drugs
      can lead to inactivation of AXL-mediated signaling pathways and can lead to
      regained drug sensitivity and improved therapeutic efficacy, defining AXL as a
      promising novel target for cancer therapeutics. This review highlights the data
      supporting AXL as a novel treatment candidate in a variety of cancers as well as 
      the current status of drug development targeting the AXL/GAS6 axis and future
      perspectives in this emerging field.

TI  - Mutational analysis of genes coding for cell surface proteins in colorectal
      cancer cell lines reveal novel altered pathways, druggable mutations and mutated 
      epitopes for targeted therapy.
PG  - 9199-213
AB  - We carried out a mutational analysis of 3,594 genes coding for cell surface
      proteins (Surfaceome) in 23 colorectal cancer cell lines, searching for new
      altered pathways, druggable mutations and mutated epitopes for targeted therapy
      in colorectal cancer. A total of 3,944 somatic non-synonymous substitutions and
      595 InDels, occurring in 2,061 (57%) Surfaceome genes were catalogued. We
      identified 48 genes not previously described as mutated in colorectal tumors in
      the TCGA database, including genes that are mutated and expressed in >10% of the 
      cell lines (SEMA4C, FGFRL1, PKD1, FAM38A, WDR81, TMEM136, SLC36A1, SLC26A6,
      IGFLR1). Analysis of these genes uncovered important roles for FGF and SEMA4
      signaling in colorectal cancer with possible therapeutic implications. We also
      found that cell lines express on average 11 druggable mutations, including
      frequent mutations (>20%) in the receptor tyrosine kinases AXL and EPHA2, which
      have not been previously considered as potential targets for colorectal cancer.
      Finally, we identified 82 cell surface mutated epitopes, however expression of
      only 30% of these epitopes was detected in our cell lines. Notwithstanding, 92%
      of these epitopes were expressed in cell lines with the mutator phenotype,
      opening new venues for the use of “general” immune checkpoint drugs in this
      subset of patients.

TI  - Mechanisms of AXL overexpression and function in Imatinib-resistant chronic
      myeloid leukemia cells.
PG  - 874-85
AB  - AXL is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the TAM family, the function of which is
      poorly understood. We previously identified AXL overexpression in Imatinib
      (IM)-resistant CML cell lines and patients. The present study was conducted to
      investigate the role of AXL and the mechanisms underlying AXL overexpression in
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI)-resistant CML cells. We present evidence that
      high AXL expression level is a feature of TKI-resistant CML cells and knockdown
      of AXL sensitized TKI-resistant cells to IM. In addition, expression of wild-type
      AXL but not a dominant negative form of AXL confers IM-sensitive CML cells the
      capacity to resist IM effect. AXL overexpression required PKCα and β and
      constitutive activation of ERK1/2. Accordingly, GF109203X a PKC inhibitor, U0126 
      a MEK1 inhibitor and PKCα/β knockdown restore sensitivity to IM while PKCα or
      PKCβ overexpression in CML cells promotes protection against IM-induced cell
      death. Finally, using luciferase promoter activity assays we established that AXL
      is regulated transcriptionally through the AP1 transcription factor. Our findings
      reveal an unexpected role of AXL in resistance to TKI in CML cells, identify the 
      molecular mechanisms involved in its overexpression and support the notion that
      AXL is a new marker of resistance to TKI in CML.

TI  - Neuroblastoma Tyrosine Kinase Signaling Networks Involve FYN and LYN in Endosomes
      and Lipid Rafts.
LID - e1004130
AB  - Protein phosphorylation plays a central role in creating a highly dynamic network
      of interacting proteins that reads and responds to signals from growth factors in
      the cellular microenvironment. Cells of the neural crest employ multiple
      signaling mechanisms to control migration and differentiation during development.
      It is known that defects in these mechanisms cause neuroblastoma, but how
      multiple signaling pathways interact to govern cell behavior is unknown. In a
      phosphoproteomic study of neuroblastoma cell lines and cell fractions, including 
      endosomes and detergent-resistant membranes, 1622 phosphorylated proteins were
      detected, including more than half of the receptor tyrosine kinases in the human 
      genome. Data were analyzed using a combination of graph theory and pattern
      recognition techniques that resolve data structure into networks that incorporate
      statistical relationships and protein-protein interaction data. Clusters of
      proteins in these networks are indicative of functional signaling pathways. The
      analysis indicates that receptor tyrosine kinases are functionally
      compartmentalized into distinct collaborative groups distinguished by activation 
      and intracellular localization of SRC-family kinases, especially FYN and LYN.
      Changes in intracellular localization of activated FYN and LYN were observed in
      response to stimulation of the receptor tyrosine kinases, ALK and KIT. The
      results suggest a mechanism to distinguish signaling responses to activation of
      different receptors, or combinations of receptors, that govern the behavior of
      the neural crest, which gives rise to neuroblastoma.

TI  - Data-Derived Modeling Characterizes Plasticity of MAPK Signaling in Melanoma.
LID - e1003795
AB  - The majority of melanomas have been shown to harbor somatic mutations in the
      RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, which play a major role in regulation of 
      proliferation and survival. The prevalence of these mutations makes these kinase 
      signal transduction pathways an attractive target for cancer therapy. However,
      tumors have generally shown adaptive resistance to treatment. This adaptation is 
      achieved in melanoma through its ability to undergo neovascularization, migration
      and rearrangement of signaling pathways. To understand the dynamic, nonlinear
      behavior of signaling pathways in cancer, several computational modeling
      approaches have been suggested. Most of those models require that the pathway
      topology remains constant over the entire observation period. However, changes in
      topology might underlie adaptive behavior to drug treatment. To study signaling
      rearrangements, here we present a new approach based on Fuzzy Logic (FL) that
      predicts changes in network architecture over time. This adaptive modeling
      approach was used to investigate pathway dynamics in a newly acquired
      experimental dataset describing total and phosphorylated protein signaling over
      four days in A375 melanoma cell line exposed to different kinase inhibitors.
      First, a generalized strategy was established to implement a parameter-reduced FL
      model encoding non-linear activity of a signaling network in response to
      perturbation. Next, a literature-based topology was generated and parameters of
      the FL model were derived from the full experimental dataset. Subsequently, the
      temporal evolution of model performance was evaluated by leaving time-defined
      data points out of training. Emerging discrepancies between model predictions and
      experimental data at specific time points allowed the characterization of
      potential network rearrangement. We demonstrate that this adaptive FL modeling
      approach helps to enhance our mechanistic understanding of the molecular
      plasticity of melanoma.

TI  - Prediction and Prioritization of Rare Oncogenic Mutations in the Cancer Kinome
      Using Novel Features and Multiple Classifiers.
LID - e1003545
AB  - Cancer is a genetic disease that develops through a series of somatic mutations, 
      a subset of which drive cancer progression. Although cancer genome sequencing
      studies are beginning to reveal the mutational patterns of genes in various
      cancers, identifying the small subset of “causative” mutations from the large
      subset of “non-causative” mutations, which accumulate as a consequence of the
      disease, is a challenge. In this article, we present an effective machine
      learning approach for identifying cancer-associated mutations in human protein
      kinases, a class of signaling proteins known to be frequently mutated in human
      cancers. We evaluate the performance of 11 well known supervised learners and
      show that a multiple-classifier approach, which combines the performances of
      individual learners, significantly improves the classification of known
      cancer-associated mutations. We introduce several novel features related
      specifically to structural and functional characteristics of protein kinases and 
      find that the level of conservation of the mutated residue at specific
      evolutionary depths is an important predictor of oncogenic effect. We consolidate
      the novel features and the multiple-classifier approach to prioritize and
      experimentally test a set of rare unconfirmed mutations in the epidermal growth
      factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR). Our studies identify T725M and L861R as
      rare cancer-associated mutations inasmuch as these mutations increase EGFR
      activity in the absence of the activating EGF ligand in cell-based assays.

TI  - A Systems-Level Interrogation Identifies Regulators of Drosophila Blood Cell
      Number and Survival.
LID - e1005056
AB  - In multicellular organisms, cell number is typically determined by a balance of
      intracellular signals that positively and negatively regulate cell survival and
      proliferation. Dissecting these signaling networks facilitates the understanding 
      of normal development and tumorigenesis. Here, we study signaling by the
      Drosophila PDGF/VEGF Receptor (Pvr) in embryonic blood cells (hemocytes) and in
      the related cell line Kc as a model for the requirement of PDGF/VEGF receptors in
      vertebrate cell survival and proliferation. The system allows the investigation
      of downstream and parallel signaling networks, based on the ability of Pvr to
      activate Ras/Erk, Akt/TOR, and yet-uncharacterized signaling pathway/s, which
      redundantly mediate cell survival and contribute to proliferation. Using Kc
      cells, we performed a genome wide RNAi screen for regulators of cell number in a 
      sensitized, Pvr deficient background. We identified the receptor tyrosine kinase 
      (RTK) Insulin-like receptor (InR) as a major Pvr Enhancer, and the nuclear
      hormone receptors Ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (usp), corresponding 
      to mammalian Retinoid X Receptor (RXR), as Pvr Suppressors. In vivo analysis in
      the Drosophila embryo revealed a previously unrecognized role for EcR to promote 
      apoptotic death of embryonic blood cells, which is balanced with pro-survival
      signaling by Pvr and InR. Phosphoproteomic analysis demonstrates distinct modes
      of cell number regulation by EcR and RTK signaling. We define common
      phosphorylation targets of Pvr and InR that include regulators of cell survival, 
      and unique targets responsible for specialized receptor functions. Interestingly,
      our analysis reveals that the selection of phosphorylation targets by signaling
      receptors shows qualitative changes depending on the signaling status of the
      cell, which may have wide-reaching implications for other cell regulatory
      systems.

TI  - HAM-5 Functions As a MAP Kinase Scaffold during Cell Fusion in Neurospora crassa.
LID - e1004783
AB  - Cell fusion in genetically identical Neurospora crassa germlings and in hyphae is
      a highly regulated process involving the activation of a conserved MAP kinase
      cascade that includes NRC-1, MEK-2 and MAK-2. During chemotrophic growth in
      germlings, the MAP kinase cascade members localize to conidial anastomosis tube
      (CAT) tips every ∼8 minutes, perfectly out of phase with another protein that is 
      recruited to the tip: SOFT, a recently identified scaffold for the MAK-1 MAP
      kinase pathway in Sordaria macrospora. How the MAK-2 oscillation process is
      initiated, maintained and what proteins regulate the MAP kinase cascade is
      currently unclear. A global phosphoproteomics approach using an allele of mak-2
      (mak-2Q100G) that can be specifically inhibited by the ATP analog 1NM-PP1 was
      utilized to identify MAK-2 kinase targets in germlings that were potentially
      involved in this process. One such putative target was HAM-5, a protein of
      unknown biochemical function. Previously, Δham-5 mutants were shown to be
      deficient for hyphal fusion. Here we show that HAM-5-GFP co-localized with NRC-1,
      MEK-2 and MAK-2 and oscillated with identical dynamics from the cytoplasm to CAT 
      tips during chemotropic interactions. In the Δmak-2 strain, HAM-5-GFP localized
      to punctate complexes that did not oscillate, but still localized to the germling
      tip, suggesting that MAK-2 activity influences HAM-5 function/localization.
      However, MAK-2-GFP showed cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in a Δham-5 strain
      and did not localize to puncta. Via co-immunoprecipitation experiments, HAM-5 was
      shown to physically interact with NRC-1, MEK-2 and MAK-2, suggesting that it
      functions as a scaffold/transport hub for the MAP kinase cascade members for
      oscillation and chemotropic interactions during germling and hyphal fusion in N. 
      crassa. The identification of HAM-5 as a scaffold-like protein will help to link 
      the activation of MAK-2 cascade to upstream factors and proteins involved in this
      intriguing process of fungal communication.

TI  - The Yeast Sks1p Kinase Signaling Network Regulates Pseudohyphal Growth and
      Glucose Response.
LID - e1004183
AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes a dramatic growth transition from
      its unicellular form to a filamentous state, marked by the formation of
      pseudohyphal filaments of elongated and connected cells. Yeast pseudohyphal
      growth is regulated by signaling pathways responsive to reductions in the
      availability of nitrogen and glucose, but the molecular link between pseudohyphal
      filamentation and glucose signaling is not fully understood. Here, we identify
      the glucose-responsive Sks1p kinase as a signaling protein required for
      pseudohyphal growth induced by nitrogen limitation and coupled nitrogen/glucose
      limitation. To identify the Sks1p signaling network, we applied mass
      spectrometry-based quantitative phosphoproteomics, profiling over 900
      phosphosites for phosphorylation changes dependent upon Sks1p kinase activity.
      From this analysis, we report a set of novel phosphorylation sites and highlight 
      Sks1p-dependent phosphorylation in Bud6p, Itr1p, Lrg1p, Npr3p, and Pda1p. In
      particular, we analyzed the Y309 and S313 phosphosites in the pyruvate
      dehydrogenase subunit Pda1p; these residues are required for pseudohyphal growth,
      and Y309A mutants exhibit phenotypes indicative of impaired aerobic respiration
      and decreased mitochondrial number. Epistasis studies place SKS1 downstream of
      the G-protein coupled receptor GPR1 and the G-protein RAS2 but upstream of or at 
      the level of cAMP-dependent PKA. The pseudohyphal growth and glucose signaling
      transcription factors Flo8p, Mss11p, and Rgt1p are required to achieve wild-type 
      SKS1 transcript levels. SKS1 is conserved, and deletion of the SKS1 ortholog SHA3
      in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans results in abnormal colony morphology. 
      Collectively, these results identify Sks1p as an important regulator of
      filamentation and glucose signaling, with additional relevance towards
      understanding stress-responsive signaling in C. albicans.

TI  - A Multi-Omics Approach Identifies Key Hubs Associated with Cell Type-Specific
      Responses of Airway Epithelial Cells to Staphylococcal Alpha-Toxin.
LID - e0122089
AB  - Responsiveness of cells to alpha-toxin (Hla) from Staphylococcus aureus appears
      to occur in a cell-type dependent manner. Here, we compare two human bronchial
      epithelial cell lines, i.e. Hla-susceptible 16HBE14o- and Hla-resistant S9 cells,
      by a quantitative multi-omics strategy for a better understanding of Hla-induced 
      cellular programs. Phosphoproteomics revealed a substantial impact on
      phosphorylation-dependent signaling in both cell models and highlights
      alterations in signaling pathways associated with cell-cell and cell-matrix
      contacts as well as the actin cytoskeleton as key features of early rHla-induced 
      effects. Along comparable changes in down-stream activity of major protein
      kinases significant differences between both models were found upon
      rHla-treatment including activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR 
      and mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK1/3 signaling in S9 and repression in
      16HBE14o- cells. System-wide transcript and protein expression profiling indicate
      induction of an immediate early response in either model. In addition, EGFR and
      MAPK1/3-mediated changes in gene expression suggest cellular recovery and
      survival in S9 cells but cell death in 16HBE14o- cells. Strikingly, inhibition of
      the EGFR sensitized S9 cells to Hla indicating that the cellular capacity of
      activation of the EGFR is a major protective determinant against Hla-mediated
      cytotoxic effects.

TI  - Proteome-Wide Lysine Acetylation in Cortical Astrocytes and Alterations That
      Occur during Infection with Brain Parasite Toxoplasma gondii.
LID - e0117966
AB  - Lysine acetylation is a reversible post-translational modification (PTM) that has
      been detected on thousands of proteins in nearly all cellular compartments. The
      role of this widespread PTM has yet to be fully elucidated, but can impact
      protein localization, interactions, activity, and stability. Here we present the 
      first proteome-wide survey of lysine acetylation in cortical astrocytes, a
      subtype of glia that is a component of the blood-brain barrier and a key
      regulator of neuronal function and plasticity. We identified 529 lysine
      acetylation sites across 304 proteins found in multiple cellular compartments
      that largely function in RNA processing/transcription, metabolism, chromatin
      biology, and translation. Two hundred and seventy-seven of the acetylated lysines
      we identified on 186 proteins have not been reported previously in any other cell
      type. We also mapped an acetylome of astrocytes infected with the brain parasite,
      Toxoplasma gondii. It has been shown that infection with T. gondii modulates host
      cell gene expression, including several lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) and
      deacetylase (KDAC) genes, suggesting that the host acetylome may also be altered 
      during infection. In the T. gondii-infected astrocytes, we identified 34 proteins
      exhibiting a level of acetylation >2-fold and 24 with a level of acetylation
      <2-fold relative to uninfected astrocytes. Our study documents the first
      acetylome map for cortical astrocytes, uncovers novel lysine acetylation sites,
      and demonstrates that T. gondii infection produces an altered acetylome.

TI  - Regulation of Neuronal Cav3.1 Channels by Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5 (Cdk5).
LID - e0119134
AB  - Low voltage-activated (LVA) T-type Ca2+ channels activate in response to
      subthreshold membrane depolarizations and therefore represent an important source
      of Ca2+ influx near the resting membrane potential. In neurons, these proteins
      significantly contribute to control relevant physiological processes including
      neuronal excitability, pacemaking and post-inhibitory rebound burst firing. Three
      subtypes of T-type channels (Cav3.1 to Cav3.3) have been identified, and using
      functional expression of recombinant channels diverse studies have validated the 
      notion that T-type Ca2+ channels can be modulated by various endogenous ligands
      as well as by second messenger pathways. In this context, the present study
      reveals a previously unrecognized role for cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in
      the regulation of native T-type channels in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, as well 
      as recombinant Cav3.1channels heterologously expressed in HEK-293 cells. Cdk5 and
      its co-activators play critical roles in the regulation of neuronal
      differentiation, cortical lamination, neuronal cell migration and axon outgrowth.
      Our results show that overexpression of Cdk5 causes a significant increase in
      whole cell patch clamp currents through T-type channels in N1E-115 cells, while
      siRNA knockdown of Cdk5 greatly reduced these currents. Consistent with this,
      overexpression of Cdk5 in HEK-293 cells stably expressing Cav3.1channels
      upregulates macroscopic currents. Furthermore, using site-directed mutagenesis we
      identified a major phosphorylation site at serine 2234 within the C-terminal
      region of the Cav3.1subunit. These results highlight a novel role for Cdk5 in the
      regulation of T-type Ca2+ channels.

TI  - Loss of Prolyl Carboxypeptidase in Two-Kidney, One-Clip Goldblatt Hypertensive
      Mice.
LID - e0117899
AB  - It is well documented that angiotensin (Ang) II contributes to kidney disease
      progression. The protease prolyl carboxypeptidase (PRCP) is highly expressed in
      the kidney and may be renoprotective by degrading Ang II to Ang-(1-7). The aim of
      the study was to investigate whether renal PRCP protein expression and activity
      are altered in two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) Goldblatt hypertensive mice. Left
      renal artery was constricted by using 0.12 mm silver clips. Blood pressure was
      measured using telemetry over the eleven weeks of study period and revealed an
      immediate increase in 2K1C animals during the first week of clip placement which 
      was followed by a gradual decrease to baseline blood pressure. Similarly, urinary
      albumin excretion was significantly increased one week after 2K1C and returned to
      baseline levels during the following weeks. At 2 weeks and at the end of the
      study, renal pathologies were exacerbated in the 2K1C model as revealed by a
      significant increase in mesangial expansion and renal fibrosis. Renal PRCP
      expression and activity were significantly reduced in clipped kidneys.
      Immunofluorescence revealed the loss of renal tubular PRCP but not glomerular
      PRCP. In contrast, expression of prolyl endopeptidase, another enzyme capable of 
      converting Ang II into Ang-(1-7), was not affected, while angiotensin converting 
      enzyme was elevated in unclipped kidneys and renin was increased in clipped
      kidneys. Results suggest that PRCP is suppressed in 2K1C and that this
      downregulation may attenuate renoprotective effects via impaired Ang II
      degradation by PRCP.

      Oxide Nanoparticles.
LID - e114390
AB  - Copper (II) oxide (CuO) nanoparticles (NP) are widely used in industry and
      medicine. In our study we evaluated the response of BEAS-2B human lung cells to
      CuO NP, using Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture
      (SILAC)-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics. Pathway modeling of the protein
      differential expression showed that CuO NP affect proteins relevant in cellular
      function and maintenance, protein synthesis, cell death and survival, cell cycle 
      and cell morphology. Some of the signaling pathways represented by BEAS-2B
      proteins responsive to the NP included mTOR signaling, protein ubiquitination
      pathway, actin cytoskeleton signaling and epithelial adherens junction signaling.
      Follow-up experiments showed that CuO NP altered actin cytoskeleton, protein
      phosphorylation and protein ubiquitination level.

TI  - Functional Aspects of the EGF-Induced MAP Kinase Cascade: A Complex
      Self-Organizing System Approach.
LID - e111612
AB  - The EGF-induced MAP kinase cascade is one of the most important and best
      characterized networks in intracellular signalling. It has a vital role in the
      development and maturation of living organisms. However, when deregulated, it is 
      involved in the onset of a number of diseases. Based on a computational model
      describing a “surface” and an “internalized” parallel route, we use systems
      biology techniques to characterize aspects of the network’s functional
      organization. We examine the re-organization of protein groups from low to high
      external stimulation, define functional groups of proteins within the network,
      determine the parameter best encoding for input intensity and predict the effect 
      of protein removal to the system’s output response. Extensive functional
      re-organization of proteins is observed in the lower end of stimulus
      concentrations. As we move to higher concentrations the variability is less
      pronounced. 6 functional groups have emerged from a consensus clustering
      approach, reflecting different dynamical aspects of the network. Mutual
      information investigation revealed that the maximum activation rate of the two
      output proteins best encodes for stimulus intensity. Removal of each protein of
      the network resulted in a range of graded effects, from complete silencing to
      intense activation. Our results provide a new “vista” of the EGF-induced MAP
      kinase cascade, from the perspective of complex self-organizing systems.
      Functional grouping of the proteins reveals an organizational scheme contrasting 
      the current understanding of modular topology. The six identified groups may
      provide the means to experimentally follow the dynamics of this complex network. 
      Also, the vulnerability analysis approach may be used for the development of
      novel therapeutic targets in the context of personalized medicine.

TI  - Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Improves Insulin Sensitivity and Synergizes with
      Insulin in Human Adipose Stem Cell-Derived (hASC) Adipocytes.
LID - e111767
AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) has evolved as a major metabolic regulator,
      the pharmacological administration of which causes weight loss, insulin
      sensitivity and glucose control in rodents and humans. To understand the
      molecular mechanisms by which FGF21 exerts its metabolic effects, we developed a 
      human in vitro model of adipocytes to examine crosstalk between FGF21 and insulin
      signaling. Human adipose stem cell-derived (hASC) adipocytes were acutely treated
      with FGF21 alone, insulin alone, or in combination. Insulin signaling under these
      conditions was assessed by measuring tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor
      (InsR), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), and serine 473 phosphorylation of
      Akt, followed by a functional assay using 14C-2-deoxyglucose [14C]-2DG to measure
      glucose uptake in these cells. FGF21 alone caused a modest increase of glucose
      uptake, but treatment with FGF21 in combination with insulin had a synergistic
      effect on glucose uptake in these cells. The presence of FGF21 also effectively
      lowered the insulin concentration required to achieve the same level of glucose
      uptake compared to the absence of FGF21 by 10-fold. This acute effect of FGF21 on
      insulin signaling was not due to IR, IGF-1R, or IRS-1 activation. Moreover, we
      observed a substantial increase in basal S473-Akt phosphorylation by FGF21 alone,
      in contrast to the minimal shift in basal glucose uptake. Taken together, our
      data demonstrate that acute co-treatment of hASC-adipocytes with FGF21 and
      insulin can result in a synergistic improvement in glucose uptake. These effects 
      were shown to occur at or downstream of Akt, or separate from the canonical
      insulin signaling pathway.

TI  - Identification of the PLK2-Dependent Phosphopeptidome by Quantitative Proteomics.
LID - e111018
AB  - Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) has been recently recognized as the major enzyme
      responsible for phosphorylation of α-synuclein at S129 in vitro and in vivo,
      suggesting that this kinase may play a key role in the pathogenesis of
      Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies. Moreover PLK2 seems to be
      implicated in cell division, oncogenesis, and synaptic regulation of the brain.
      However little is known about the phosphoproteome generated by PLK2 and,
      consequently the overall impact of PLK2 on cellular signaling. To fill this gap
      we exploited an approach based on in vitro kinase assay and quantitative
      phosphoproteomics. A proteome-derived peptide library obtained by digestion of
      undifferentiated human neuroblastoma cell line was exhaustively dephosphorylated 
      by lambda phosphatase followed by incubation with or without PLK2 recombinant
      kinase. Stable isotope labeling based quantitative phosphoproteomics was applied 
      to identify the phosphosites generated by PLK2. A total of 98 unique
      PLK2-dependent phosphosites from 89 proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS.
      Analysis of the primary structure of the identified phosphosites allowed the
      detailed definition of the kinase specificity and the compilation of a list of
      potential PLK2 targets among those retrieved in PhosphositePlus, a curated
      database of in cell/vivo phosphorylation sites.

LID - e110873
AB  - This study aimed to characterize a soluble proteome of popliteal lymph nodes
      during lymphadenitis induced by intradermal injection of Bacillus anthracis
      Sterne spores in mice using tandem LC-MS/MS and reverse-phase protein microarray 
      with antibodies specific to epitopes of phosphorylated proteins. More than 380
      proteins were detected in the normal intra-nodal lymph, while the infectious
      process resulted in the profound changes in the protein abundances and appearance
      of 297 unique proteins. These proteins belong to an array of processes reflecting
      response to wounding, inflammation and perturbations of hemostasis, innate immune
      response, coagulation and fibrinolysis, regulation of body fluid levels and
      vascular disturbance among others. Comparison of lymph and serum revealed 83
      common proteins. Also, using 71 antibodies specific to total and phosphorylated
      forms of proteins we carried initial characterization of circulating lymph
      phosphoproteome which brought additional information regarding signaling pathways
      operating in the lymphatics. The results demonstrate that the proteome of
      intra-nodal lymph serves as a sensitive sentinel of the processes occurring
      within the lymph nodes during infection. The acute innate response of the lymph
      nodes to anthrax is accompanied by cellular damage and inflammation with a large 
      number of up- and down-regulated proteins many of which are distinct from those
      detected in serum. MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier
      PXD001342.

      Shp2 in Noonan and LEOPARD Syndrome.
LID - e106682
AB  - Noonan syndrome (NS) and LEOPARD syndrome (LS) cause congenital afflictions such 
      as short stature, hypertelorism and heart defects. More than 50% of NS and almost
      all of LS cases are caused by activating and inactivating mutations of the
      phosphatase Shp2, respectively. How these biochemically opposing mutations lead
      to similar clinical outcomes is not clear. Using zebrafish models of NS and LS
      and mass spectrometry-based phosphotyrosine proteomics, we identified a
      down-regulated peptide of Fer kinase in both NS and LS. Further investigation
      showed a role for Fer during development, where morpholino-based knockdown caused
      craniofacial defects, heart edema and short stature. During gastrulation, loss of
      Fer caused convergence and extension defects without affecting cell fate.
      Moreover, Fer knockdown cooperated with NS and LS, but not wild type Shp2 to
      induce developmental defects, suggesting a role for Fer in the pathogenesis of
      both NS and LS.

TI  - Phosphorylation Site Dynamics of Early T-cell Receptor Signaling.
LID - e104240
AB  - In adaptive immune responses, T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling impacts multiple
      cellular processes and results in T-cell differentiation, proliferation, and
      cytokine production. Although individual protein–protein interactions and
      phosphorylation events have been studied extensively, we lack a systems-level
      understanding of how these components cooperate to control signaling dynamics,
      especially during the crucial first seconds of stimulation. Here, we used
      quantitative proteomics to characterize reshaping of the T-cell phosphoproteome
      in response to TCR/CD28 co-stimulation, and found that diverse dynamic patterns
      emerge within seconds. We detected phosphorylation dynamics as early as 5 s and
      observed widespread regulation of key TCR signaling proteins by 30 s. Development
      of a computational model pointed to the presence of novel regulatory mechanisms
      controlling phosphorylation of sites with central roles in TCR signaling. The
      model was used to generate predictions suggesting unexpected roles for the
      phosphatase PTPN6 (SHP-1) and shortcut recruitment of the actin regulator WAS.
      Predictions were validated experimentally. This integration of proteomics and
      modeling illustrates a novel, generalizable framework for solidifying
      quantitative understanding of a signaling network and for elucidating missing
      links.

TI  - SPO24 Is a Transcriptionally Dynamic, Small ORF-Encoding Locus Required for
      Efficient Sporulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
LID - e105058
AB  - In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, meiosis and sporulation are highly regulated
      responses that are driven in part by changes in RNA expression. Alternative mRNA 
      forms with extended 5′ UTRs are atypical in S. cerevisiae, and 5′ extensions with
      upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are even more unusual. Here we characterize 
      the gene YPR036W-A, now renamed SPO24, which encodes a very small (67-amino-acid)
      protein. This gene gives rise to two mRNA forms: a shorter form throughout
      meiosis and a longer, 5′-extended form in mid-late meiosis. The latter form
      includes a uORF for a 14-amino-acid peptide (Spo24u14). Deletion of the
      downstream ORF (dORF) leads to sporulation defects and the appearance of
      pseudohyphae-like projections. Experiments with luciferase reporters indicate
      that the uORF does not downregulate dORF translation. The protein encoded by the 
      dORF (Spo24d67) localizes to the prospore membrane and is differentially
      phosphorylated during meiosis. Transcription of the 5′-extended mRNA in
      mid-meiosis depends upon the presence of two middle sporulation elements (MSEs). 
      Removal of the MSEs severely inhibits the mid-meiotic appearance of the
      5′-extended mRNA and limits the ability of plasmid-borne SPO24 to rescue the
      sporulation defect of a spo24Δ mutant, suggesting that the 5′-extended mRNA is
      functionally important. These results reveal Spo24d67 as a sporulation-related
      factor that is encoded by a transcriptionally dynamic, uORF-containing locus.

TI  - Identification of Significant Features by the Global Mean Rank Test.
LID - e104504
AB  - With the introduction of omics-technologies such as transcriptomics and
      proteomics, numerous methods for the reliable identification of significantly
      regulated features (genes, proteins, etc.) have been developed. Experimental
      practice requires these tests to successfully deal with conditions such as small 
      numbers of replicates, missing values, non-normally distributed expression
      levels, and non-identical distributions of features. With the MeanRank test we
      aimed at developing a test that performs robustly under these conditions, while
      favorably scaling with the number of replicates. The test proposed here is a
      global one-sample location test, which is based on the mean ranks across
      replicates, and internally estimates and controls the false discovery rate.
      Furthermore, missing data is accounted for without the need of imputation. In
      extensive simulations comparing MeanRank to other frequently used methods, we
      found that it performs well with small and large numbers of replicates, feature
      dependent variance between replicates, and variable regulation across features on
      simulation data and a recent two-color microarray spike-in dataset. The tests
      were then used to identify significant changes in the phosphoproteomes of cancer 
      cells induced by the kinase inhibitors erlotinib and 3-MB-PP1 in two
      independently published mass spectrometry-based studies. MeanRank outperformed
      the other global rank-based methods applied in this study. Compared to the
      popular Significance Analysis of Microarrays and Linear Models for Microarray
      methods, MeanRank performed similar or better. Furthermore, MeanRank exhibits
      more consistent behavior regarding the degree of regulation and is robust against
      the choice of preprocessing methods. MeanRank does not require any imputation of 
      missing values, is easy to understand, and yields results that are easy to
      interpret. The software implementing the algorithm is freely available for
      academic and commercial use.

TI  - Salt-Induced Changes in Cardiac Phosphoproteome in a Rat Model of Chronic Renal
      Failure.
LID - e100331
AB  - Heart damage is widely present in patients with chronic kidney disease. Salt diet
      is the most important environmental factor affecting development of chronic renal
      failure and cardiovascular diseases. The proteins involved in chronic kidney
      disease -induced heart damage, especially their posttranslational modifications, 
      remain largely unknown to date. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 5/6 nephrectomy
      (chronic renal failure model) or sham operation were treated for 2 weeks with a
      normal-(0.4% NaCl), or high-salt (4% NaCl) diet. We employed TiO2 enrichment,
      iTRAQ labeling and liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry strategy for
      phosphoproteomic profiling of left ventricular free walls in these animals. A
      total of 1724 unique phosphopeptides representing 2551 non-redundant
      phosphorylation sites corresponding to 763 phosphoproteins were identified.
      During normal salt feeding, 89 (54%) phosphopeptides upregulated and 76 (46%)
      phosphopeptides downregulated in chronic renal failure rats relative to sham
      rats. In chronic renal failure rats, high salt intake induced upregulation of 84 
      (49%) phosphopeptides and downregulation of 88 (51%) phosphopeptides. Database
      searches revealed that most of the identified phospholproteins were important
      signaling molecules such as protein kinases, receptors and phosphatases. These
      phospholproteins were involved in energy metabolism, cell communication, cell
      differentiation, cell death and other biological processes. The Search Tool for
      the Retrieval of Interacting Genes analysis revealed functional links among 15
      significantly regulated phosphoproteins in chronic renal failure rats compared to
      sham group, and 23 altered phosphoproteins induced by high salt intake. The
      altered phosphorylation levels of two proteins involved in heart damage, lamin A 
      and phospholamban were validated. Expression of the downstream genes of these two
      proteins, desmin and SERCA2a, were also analyzed.

TI  - Predicting Kinase Activity in Angiotensin Receptor Phosphoproteomes Based on
      Sequence-Motifs and Interactions.
LID - e94672
AB  - Recent progress in the understanding of seven-transmembrane receptor (7TMR)
      signalling has promoted the development of a new generation of pathway selective 
      ligands. The angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1aR) is one of the most studied
      7TMRs with respect to selective activation of the β-arrestin dependent
      signalling. Two complimentary global phosphoproteomics studies have analyzed the 
      complex signalling induced by the AT1aR. Here we integrate the data sets from
      these studies and perform a joint analysis using a novel method for prediction of
      differential kinase activity from phosphoproteomics data. The method builds upon 
      NetworKIN, which applies sophisticated linear motif analysis in combination with 
      contextual network modelling to predict kinase-substrate associations with high
      accuracy and sensitivity. These predictions form the basis for subsequently
      nonparametric statistical analysis to identify likely activated kinases. This
      suggested that AT1aR-dependent signalling activates 48 of the 285 kinases
      detected in HEK293 cells. Of these, Aurora B, CLK3 and PKG1 have not previously
      been described in the pathway whereas others, such as PKA, PKB and PKC, are well 
      known. In summary, we have developed a new method for kinase-centric analysis of 
      phosphoproteomes to pinpoint differential kinase activity in large-scale data
      sets.

TI  - Quantification of Pancreatic Cancer Proteome and Phosphorylome: Indicates
      Molecular Events Likely Contributing to Cancer and Activity of Drug Targets.
LID - e90948
AB  - Objective: LC-MS/MS phospho-proteomics is an essential technology to help unravel
      the complex molecular events that lead to and propagate cancer. We have developed
      a global phospho-proteomic workflow to determine activity of signaling pathways
      and drug targets in pancreatic cancer tissue for clinical application. Methods:
      Peptides resulting from tryptic digestion of proteins extracted from frozen
      tissue of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and background pancreas (n = 12), were
      labelled with tandem mass tags (TMT 8-plex), separated by strong cation exchange 
      chromatography, then were analysed by LC-MS/MS directly or first enriched for
      phosphopeptides using IMAC and TiO2, prior to analysis. In-house, commercial and 
      freeware bioinformatic platforms were used to identify relevant biological events
      from the complex dataset. Results: Of 2,101 proteins identified, 152 demonstrated
      significant difference in abundance between tumor and non-tumor tissue. They
      included proteins that are known to be up-regulated in pancreatic cancer (e.g.
      Mucin-1), but the majority were new candidate markers such as HIPK1 & MLCK. Of
      the 6,543 unique phosphopeptides identified (6,284 unique phosphorylation sites),
      635 showed significant regulation, particularly those from proteins involved in
      cell migration (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors & MRCKα) and formation of
      focal adhesions. Activator phosphorylation sites on FYN, AKT1, ERK2, HDAC1 and
      other drug targets were found to be highly modulated (≥2 fold) in different cases
      highlighting their predictive power. Conclusion: Here we provided critical
      information enabling us to identify the common and unique molecular events likely
      contributing to cancer in each case. Such information may be used to help predict
      more bespoke therapy suitable for an individual case.

TI  - Searching for Novel Cdk5 Substrates in Brain by Comparative Phosphoproteomics of 
      Wild Type and Cdk5−/− Mice.
LID - e90363
AB  - Protein phosphorylation is the most common post-translational modification that
      regulates several pivotal functions in cells. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is
      a proline-directed serine/threonine kinase which is mostly active in the nervous 
      system. It regulates several biological processes such as neuronal migration,
      cytoskeletal dynamics, axonal guidance and synaptic plasticity among others. In
      search for novel substrates of Cdk5 in the brain we performed quantitative
      phosphoproteomics analysis, isolating phosphoproteins from whole brain derived
      from E18.5 Cdk5+/+ and Cdk5−/− embryos, using an Immobilized Metal-Ion Affinity
      Chromatography (IMAC), which specifically binds to phosphorylated proteins. The
      isolated phosphoproteins were eluted and isotopically labeled for relative and
      absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and mass spectrometry identification. We found 40
      proteins that showed decreased phosphorylation at Cdk5−/− brains. In addition,
      out of these 40 hypophosphorylated proteins we characterized two proteins,
      :MARCKS (Myristoylated Alanine-Rich protein Kinase C substrate) and Grin1 (G
      protein regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1). MARCKS is known to be
      phosphorylated by Cdk5 in chick neural cells while Grin1 has not been reported to
      be phosphorylated by Cdk5. When these proteins were overexpressed in N2A
      neuroblastoma cell line along with p35, serine phosphorylation in their Cdk5
      motifs was found to be increased. In contrast, treatments with roscovitine, the
      Cdk5 inhibitor, resulted in an opposite effect on serine phosphorylation in N2A
      cells and primary hippocampal neurons transfected with MARCKS. In summary, the
      results presented here identify Grin 1 as novel Cdk5 substrate and confirm
      previously identified MARCKS as a a bona fide Cdk5 substrate.

      full thickness, reconstituted 3-dimensional skin tissue model 48 hr after
      exposure to 3, 10 and 200 cGy of X-rays. Overall, 135 proteins showed statistical
      significant difference between the sham (0 cGy) and any of the irradiated groups 
      (3, 10 or 200 cGy) on the basis of Dunnett adjusted t-test; among these, 97
      proteins showed a trend of downregulation and 9 proteins showed a trend of
      upregulation with increasing radiation dose. In addition, there were 21 and 8
      proteins observed to have irregular trends with the 10 cGy irradiated group
      either having the highest or the lowest level among all three radiated doses.
      Moreover, two proteins, carboxypeptidase E and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal
      hydrolase isozyme L1 were sensitive to ionizing radiation, but relatively
      independent of radiation dose. Conversely, proteasome activator complex subunit 2
      protein appeared to be sensitive to the dose of radiation, as rapid upregulation 
      of this protein was observed when radiation doses were increased from 3, to 10 or
      200 cGy. These results suggest that different mechanisms of action exist at the
      secretome level for low and high doses of ionizing radiation.

TI  - Whole Genome Analyses of a Well-Differentiated Liposarcoma Reveals Novel SYT1 and
      DDR2 Rearrangements.
LID - e87113
AB  - Liposarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma, but little is known about the
      genomic basis of this disease. Given the low cell content of this tumor type, we 
      utilized flow cytometry to isolate the diploid normal and aneuploid tumor
      populations from a well-differentiated liposarcoma prior to array comparative
      genomic hybridization and whole genome sequencing. This work revealed massive
      highly focal amplifications throughout the aneuploid tumor genome including MDM2,
      a gene that has previously been found to be amplified in well-differentiated
      liposarcoma. Structural analysis revealed massive rearrangement of chromosome 12 
      and 11 gene fusions, some of which may be part of double minute chromosomes
      commonly present in well-differentiated liposarcoma. We identified a hotspot of
      genomic instability localized to a region of chromosome 12 that includes a highly
      conserved, putative L1 retrotransposon element, LOC100507498 which resides within
      a gene cluster (NAV3, SYT1, PAWR) where 6 of the 11 fusion events occurred.
      Interestingly, a potential gene fusion was also identified in amplified DDR2,
      which is a potential therapeutic target of kinase inhibitors such as dastinib,
      that are not routinely used in the treatment of patients with liposarcoma.
      Furthermore, 7 somatic, damaging single nucleotide variants have also been
      identified, including D125N in the PTPRQ protein. In conclusion, this work is the
      first to report the entire genome of a well-differentiated liposarcoma with novel
      chromosomal rearrangements associated with amplification of therapeutically
      targetable genes such as MDM2 and DDR2.

TI  - Proteome Analysis for Downstream Targets of Oncogenic KRAS - the Potential
      Participation of CLIC4 in Carcinogenesis in the Lung.
LID - e87193
AB  - This study investigated the proteome modulated by oncogenic KRAS in immortalized 
      airway epithelial cells. Chloride intracellular channel protein 4 (CLIC4), S100
      proteins (S100A2 and S100A11), tropomyosin 2, cathepsin L1, integrinsα3,
      eukaryotic elongation factor 1, vimentin, and others were discriminated. We here 
      focused on CLIC4 to investigate its potential involvement in carcinogenesis in
      the lung because previous studies suggested that some chloride channels and
      chloride channel regulators could function as tumor suppressors. CILC4 protein
      levels were reduced in some lung cancer cell lines. The restoration of CLIC4 in
      lung cancer cell lines in which CLIC4 expression was reduced attenuated their
      growth activity. The immunohistochemical expression of the CLIC4 protein was
      weaker in primary lung cancer cells than in non-tumorous airway epithelial cells 
      and was occasionally undetectable in some tumors. CLIC4 protein levels were
      significantly lower in a subtype of mucinous ADC than in others, and were also
      significantly lower in KRAS-mutated ADC than in EGFR-mutated ADC. These results
      suggest that the alteration in CLIC4 could be involved in restrictedly the
      development of a specific fraction of lung adenocarcinomas. The potential benefit
      of the proteome modulated by oncogenic KRAS to lung cancer research has been
      demonstrated.

TI  - Phosphocaveolin-1 Enforces Tumor Growth and Chemoresistance in Rhabdomyosarcoma.
LID - e84618
AB  - Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) can ambiguously behave as either tumor suppressor or oncogene 
      depending on its phosphorylation state and the type of cancer. In this study we
      show that Cav-1 was phosphorylated on tyrosine 14 (pCav-1) by Src-kinase family
      members in various human cell lines and primary mouse cultures of
      rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most frequent soft-tissue sarcoma affecting
      childhood. Cav-1 overexpression in the human embryonal RD or alveolar RH30 cells 
      yielded increased pCav-1 levels and reinforced the phosphorylation state of
      either ERK or AKT kinase, respectively, in turn enhancing in vitro cell
      proliferation, migration, invasiveness and chemoresistance. In contrast, reducing
      the pCav-1 levels by administration of a Src-kinase inhibitor or through targeted
      Cav-1 silencing counteracted the malignant in vitro phenotype of RMS cells.
      Consistent with these results, xenotransplantation of Cav-1 overexpressing RD
      cells into nude mice resulted in substantial tumor growth in comparison to
      control cells. Taken together, these data point to pCav-1 as an important and
      therapeutically valuable target for overcoming the progression and multidrug
      resistance of RMS.

TI  - Phosphoproteomics and Bioinformatics Analyses of Spinal Cord Proteins in Rats
      with Morphine Tolerance.
LID - e83817
AB  - Introduction: Morphine is the most effective pain-relieving drug, but it can
      cause unwanted side effects. Direct neuraxial administration of morphine to
      spinal cord not only can provide effective, reliable pain relief but also can
      prevent the development of supraspinal side effects. However, repeated neuraxial 
      administration of morphine may still lead to morphine tolerance. Methods: To
      better understand the mechanism that causes morphine tolerance, we induced
      tolerance in rats at the spinal cord level by giving them twice-daily injections 
      of morphine (20 µg/10 µL) for 4 days. We confirmed tolerance by measuring paw
      withdrawal latencies and maximal possible analgesic effect of morphine on day 5. 
      We then carried out phosphoproteomic analysis to investigate the global
      phosphorylation of spinal proteins associated with morphine tolerance. Finally,
      pull-down assays were used to identify phosphorylated types and sites of 14-3-3
      proteins, and bioinformatics was applied to predict biological networks impacted 
      by the morphine-regulated proteins. Results: Our proteomics data showed that
      repeated morphine treatment altered phosphorylation of 10 proteins in the spinal 
      cord. Pull-down assays identified 2 serine/threonine phosphorylated sites in
      14-3-3 proteins. Bioinformatics further revealed that morphine impacted on
      cytoskeletal reorganization, neuroplasticity, protein folding and modulation,
      signal transduction and biomolecular metabolism. Conclusions: Repeated morphine
      administration may affect multiple biological networks by altering protein
      phosphorylation. These data may provide insight into the mechanism that underlies
      the development of morphine tolerance.

TI  - Endogenous Carbamylation of Renal Medullary Proteins.
LID - e82655
AB  - Protein carbamylation is a post-translational modification that can occur in the 
      presence of urea. In solution, urea is in equilibrium with ammonium cyanate, and 
      carbamylation occurs when cyanate ions react with the amino groups of lysines,
      arginines, protein N-termini, as well as sulfhydryl groups of cysteines. The
      concentration of urea is elevated in the renal inner medulla compared with other 
      tissues. Due to the high urea concentration, we hypothesized that carbamylation
      can occur endogenously within the rat inner medulla. Using immunoblotting of rat 
      kidney cortical and medullary homogenates with a carbamyl-lysine specific
      antibody, we showed that carbamylation is present in a large number of inner
      medullary proteins. Using protein mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of rat renal inner
      medulla, we identified 456 unique carbamylated sites in 403 proteins, including
      many that play important physiological roles in the renal medulla [Data can be
      accessed at
      https://helixweb.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/Carbamylation/Carbamylation_peptide_sorted
      .html]. We conclude that protein carbamylation occurs endogenously in the kidney,
      modifying many physiologically important proteins.

LID - e82513
AB  - Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor of childhood with a heterogenous clinical
      presentation that reflects differences in activation of complex biological
      signaling pathways. Protein phosphorylation is a key component of cellular signal
      transduction and plays a critical role in processes that control cancer cell
      growth and survival. We used shotgun LC/MS to compare phosphorylation between a

      and a human neural precursor cell line (NPC), modeling a normal baseline neural
      crest cell. 2181 unique phosphorylation sites representing 1171 proteins and 2598
      phosphopeptides were found. Protein kinases accounted for 6% of the proteome,
      with a predominance of tyrosine kinases, supporting their prominent role in
      oncogenic signaling pathways. Highly abundant receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
      phosphopeptides in the NB10 cell line relative to the NPC cell line included RET,
      insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor/insulin receptor (IGF-1R/IR), and
      fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). Multiple phosphorylated peptides
      from downstream mediators of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS pathways were also highly 
      abundant in NB10 relative to NPC. Our analysis highlights the importance of RET, 
      IGF-1R/IR and FGFR1 as RTKs in neuroblastoma and suggests a methodology that can 
      be used to identify potential novel biological therapeutic targets. Furthermore, 
      application of this previously unexploited technology in the clinic opens the
      possibility of providing a new wide-scale molecular signature to assess disease
      progression and prognosis.

TI  - HDAC4 Does Not Act as a Protein Deacetylase in the Postnatal Murine Brain In
      Vivo.
LID - e80849
AB  - Reversible protein acetylation provides a central mechanism for controlling gene 
      expression and cellular signaling events. It is governed by the antagonistic
      commitment of two enzymes families: the histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the
      histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDAC4, like its class IIa counterparts, is a potent
      transcriptional repressor through interactions with tissue specific transcription
      factors via its N-terminal domain. Whilst the lysine deacetylase activity of the 
      class IIa HDACs is much less potent than that of the class I enzymes, HDAC4 has
      been reported to influence protein deacetylation through its interaction with
      HDAC3. To investigate the influence of HDAC4 on protein acetylation we employed
      the immunoaffinity-based AcetylScan proteomic method. We identified many proteins
      known to be modified by acetylation, but found that the absence of HDAC4 had no
      effect on the acetylation profile of the murine neonate brain. This is consistent
      with the biochemical data suggesting that HDAC4 may not function as a lysine
      deacetylase, but these in vivo data do not support the previous report showing
      that the enzymatic activity of HDAC3 might be modified by its interaction with
      HDAC4. To complement this work, we used Affymetrix arrays to investigate the
      effect of HDAC4 knock-out on the transcriptional profile of the postnatal murine 
      brain. There was no effect on global transcription, consistent with the absence
      of a differential histone acetylation profile. Validation of the array data by
      Taq-man qPCR indicated that only protamine 1 and Igfbp6 mRNA levels were
      increased by more than one-fold and only Calml4 was decreased. The lack of a
      major effect on the transcriptional profile is consistent with the cytoplasmic
      location of HDAC4 in the P3 murine brain.

      Plasma Membrane between Normal and Preeclampsia Pregnancies with High-Resolution 
      Mass Spectrometry.
LID - e80480
AB  - Preeclampsia is a serious complication of pregnancy, which affects 2–8% of all
      pregnancies and is one of the leading causes of maternal and perinatal mortality 
      and morbidity worldwide. To better understand the molecular mechanisms involved
      in pathological development of placenta in preeclampsia, we used high-resolution 
      LC-MS/MS technologies to construct a comparative N-glycoproteomic and
      phosphoproteomic profiling of human placental plasma membrane in normal and
      preeclamptic pregnancies. A total of 1027 N-glyco- and 2094 phospho- sites were
      detected in human placental plasma membrane, and 5 N-glyco- and 38 phospho-
      proteins, respectively, with differentially expression were definitively
      identified between control and preeclamptic placental plasma membrane. Further
      bioinformatics analysis indicated that these differentially expressed proteins
      correlate with several specific cellular processes occurring during pathological 
      changes of preeclamptic placental plasma membrane.

TI  - Global Phosphotyrosine Proteomics Identifies PKCδ as a Marker of Responsiveness
      to Src Inhibition in Colorectal Cancer.
LID - e80207
AB  - Sensitive and specific biomarkers of protein kinase inhibition can be leveraged
      to accelerate drug development studies in oncology by associating early molecular
      responses with target inhibition. In this study, we utilized unbiased shotgun
      phosphotyrosine (pY) proteomics to discover novel biomarkers of response to
      dasatinib, a small molecule Src-selective inhibitor, in preclinical models of
      colorectal cancer (CRC). We performed unbiased mass spectrometry shotgun pY
      proteomics to reveal the pY proteome of cultured HCT-116 colonic carcinoma cells,
      and then extended this analysis to HCT-116 xenograft tumors to identify pY
      biomarkers of dasatinib-responsiveness in vivo. Major dasatinib-responsive pY
      sites in xenograft tumors included sites on delta-type protein kinase C (PKCδ),
      CUB-domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1), Type-II SH2-domain-containing inositol
      5-phosphatase (SHIP2), and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (RPTPα).
      The pY313 site PKCδ was further supported as a relevant biomarker of
      dasatinib-mediated Src inhibition in HCT-116 xenografts by immunohistochemistry
      and immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antibody. Reduction of PKCδ pY313 was
      further correlated with dasatinib-mediated inhibition of Src and diminished
      growth as spheroids of a panel of human CRC cell lines. These studies reveal PKCδ
      pY313 as a promising readout of Src inhibition in CRC and potentially other solid
      tumors and may reflect responsiveness to dasatinib in a subset of colorectal
      cancers.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteome Analysis Unveils LAT as a Modulator of CD3ζ and
      ZAP-70 Tyrosine Phosphorylation.
LID - e77423
AB  - Signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR) initiates adaptive immunity and its
      perturbation may results in autoimmunity. The plasma membrane scaffolding protein
      LAT acts as a central organizer of the TCR signaling machinery to activate many
      functional pathways. LAT-deficient mice develop an autoimmune syndrome but the
      mechanism of this pathology is unknown. In this work we have compared global
      dynamics of TCR signaling by MS-based quantitative phosphoproteomics in
      LAT-sufficient and LAT-defective Jurkat T cells. Surprisingly, we found that many
      TCR-induced phosphorylation events persist in the absence of LAT, despite ERK and
      PLCγ1 phosphorylation being repressed. Most importantly, the absence of LAT
      resulted in augmented and persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of CD3ζ and ZAP70. 
      This indicates that LAT signaling hub is also implicated in negative feedback
      signals to modulate upstream phosphorylation events. Phosphorylation kinetics
      data resulting from this investigation is documented in a database (phosphoTCR)
      accessible online. The MS data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange with
      identifier PXD000341.

TI  - Effect of IRS4 Levels on PI 3-Kinase Signalling.
LID - e73327
AB  - Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and IRS2 are well-characterized adapter
      proteins that relay signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to downstream
      components of signalling pathways. In contrast, the function of IRS4 is not well 
      understood. IRS4 overexpression has been associated with acute lymphoblastic
      leukaemia and subungual exostosis, while point mutations of IRS4 have been found 
      in melanomas. Here, we show that while IRS4 expression is low in most cancer cell
      lines, IRS4 mRNA and protein levels are markedly elevated in certain cells
      including the NCI-H720, DMS114, HEK293T and HEK293AAV lines. Surprisingly, IRS4
      expression was also strongly induced when HEK293 cells were infected with
      retroviral particles and selected under puromycin, making IRS4 expression a
      potential off-target effect of retroviral expression vectors. Cells with high
      expression of IRS4 displayed high phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate
      (PIP3) levels, as well as elevated Akt and p70 S6 kinase activities, even in the 
      absence of growth factors. PI 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling in these cells depends
      on IRS4, even though these cells also express IRS1/2. Knockdown of IRS4 also
      inhibited cell proliferation in cells with high levels of IRS4. Together, these
      findings suggest IRS4 as a potential therapeutic target for cancers with high
      expression of this protein.

TI  - Cell Cycle Regulated Phosphorylation of the Telomere-Associated Protein TIN2.
LID - e71697
AB  - The protein TIN2 is a member of telomere-binding protein complex that serves to
      cap and protect mammalian chromosome ends. As a number of proteins in this
      complex are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner, we investigated
      whether TIN2 is modified by phosphorylation as well. We performed
      phospho-proteomic analysis of human TIN2, and identified two phosphorylated
      residues, serines 295 and 330. We demonstrated that both these sites were
      phosphorylated during mitosis in human cells, as detected by Phos-tag reagent and
      phosphorylation-specific antibodies. Phosphorylation of serines 295 and 330
      appeared to be mediated, at least in part, by the mitotic kinase RSK2.
      Specifically, phosphorylation of TIN2 at both these residues was increased upon
      expression of RSK2 and reduced by an inhibitor of the RSK family of kinases.
      Moreover, RSK2 phosphorylated TIN2 in vitro. The identification of these
      specifically timed post-translational events during the cell cycle suggests a
      potential mitotic regulation of TIN2 by phosphorylation.

TI  - Exosomal Signaling during Hypoxia Mediates Microvascular Endothelial Cell
      Migration and Vasculogenesis.
LID - e68451
AB  - Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are critical processes in fetal circulation and
      placental vasculature development. Placental mesenchymal stem cells (pMSC) are
      known to release paracrine factors (some of which are contained within exosomes) 
      that promote angiogenesis and cell migration. The aims of this study were: to
      determine the effects of oxygen tension on the release of exosomes from pMSC; and
      to establish the effects of pMSC-derived exosomes on the migration and angiogenic
      tube formation of placental microvascular endothelial cells (hPMEC). pMSC were
      isolated from placental villi (8–12 weeks of gestation, n = 6) and cultured under
      an atmosphere of 1%, 3% or 8% O2. Cell-conditioned media were collected and
      exosomes (exo-pMSC) isolated by differential and buoyant density centrifugation. 
      The dose effect (5–20 µg exosomal protein/ml) of pMSC-derived exosomes on hPMEC
      migration and tube formation were established using a real-time, live-cell
      imaging system (Incucyte™). The exosome pellet was resuspended in PBS and protein
      content was established by mass spectrometry (MS). Protein function and canonical
      pathways were identified using the PANTHER program and Ingenuity Pathway
      Analysis, respectively. Exo-pMSC were identified, by electron microscopy, as
      spherical vesicles, with a typical cup-shape and diameters around of 100 nm and
      positive for exosome markers: CD63, CD9 and CD81. Under hypoxic conditions (1%
      and 3% O2) exo-pMSC released increased by 3.3 and 6.7 folds, respectively, when
      compared to the controls (8% O2; p<0.01). Exo-pMSC increased hPMEC migration by
      1.6 fold compared to the control (p<0.05) and increased hPMEC tube formation by
      7.2 fold (p<0.05). MS analysis identified 390 different proteins involved in
      cytoskeleton organization, development, immunomodulatory, and cell-to-cell
      communication. The data obtained support the hypothesis that pMSC-derived
      exosomes may contribute to placental vascular adaptation to low oxygen tension
      under both physiological and pathological conditions.

TI  - Application of Multiplexed Kinase Inhibitor Beads to Study Kinome Adaptations in 
      Drug-Resistant Leukemia.
LID - e66755
AB  - Protein kinases play key roles in oncogenic signaling and are a major focus in
      the development of targeted cancer therapies. Imatinib, a BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor, is a successful front-line treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia 
      (CML). However, resistance to imatinib may be acquired by BCR-Abl mutations or
      hyperactivation of Src family kinases such as Lyn. We have used multiplexed
      kinase inhibitor beads (MIBs) and quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to compare 
      kinase expression and activity in an imatinib-resistant (MYL-R) and -sensitive
      (MYL) cell model of CML. Using MIB/MS, expression and activity changes of over
      150 kinases were quantitatively measured from various protein kinase families.
      Statistical analysis of experimental replicates assigned significance to 35 of
      these kinases, referred to as the MYL-R kinome profile. MIB/MS and immunoblotting
      confirmed the over-expression and activation of Lyn in MYL-R cells and identified
      additional kinases with increased (MEK, ERK, IKKα, PKCβ, NEK9) or decreased (Abl,
      Kit, JNK, ATM, Yes) abundance or activity. Inhibiting Lyn with dasatinib or by
      shRNA-mediated knockdown reduced the phosphorylation of MEK and IKKα. Because
      MYL-R cells showed elevated NF-κB signaling relative to MYL cells, as
      demonstrated by increased IκBα and IL-6 mRNA expression, we tested the effects of
      an IKK inhibitor (BAY 65-1942). MIB/MS and immunoblotting revealed that BAY
      65-1942 increased MEK/ERK signaling and that this increase was prevented by
      co-treatment with a MEK inhibitor (AZD6244). Furthermore, the combined inhibition
      of MEK and IKKα resulted in reduced IL-6 mRNA expression, synergistic loss of
      cell viability and increased apoptosis. Thus, MIB/MS analysis identified MEK and 
      IKKα as important downstream targets of Lyn, suggesting that co-targeting these
      kinases may provide a unique strategy to inhibit Lyn-dependent imatinib-resistant
      CML. These results demonstrate the utility of MIB/MS as a tool to identify
      dysregulated kinases and to interrogate kinome dynamics as cells respond to
      targeted kinase inhibition.

TI  - Computational Model of Gab1/2-Dependent VEGFR2 Pathway to Akt Activation.
LID - e67438
AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signal transduction is central to
      angiogenesis in development and in pathological conditions such as cancer,
      retinopathy and ischemic diseases. However, no detailed mass-action models of
      VEGF receptor signaling have been developed. We constructed and validated the
      first computational model of VEGFR2 trafficking and signaling, to study the
      opposing roles of Gab1 and Gab2 in regulation of Akt phosphorylation in
      VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells. Trafficking parameters were optimized against 
      5 previously published in vitro experiments, and the model was validated against 
      six independent published datasets. The model showed agreement at several key
      nodes, involving scaffolding proteins Gab1, Gab2 and their complexes with Shp2.
      VEGFR2 recruitment of Gab1 is greater in magnitude, slower, and more sustained
      than that of Gab2. As Gab2 binds VEGFR2 complexes more transiently than Gab1,
      VEGFR2 complexes can recycle and continue to participate in other signaling
      pathways. Correspondingly, the simulation results show a log-linear relationship 
      between a decrease in Akt phosphorylation and Gab1 knockdown while a linear
      relationship was observed between an increase in Akt phosphorylation and Gab2
      knockdown. Global sensitivity analysis demonstrated the importance of
      initial-concentration ratios of antagonistic molecular species (Gab1/Gab2 and
      PI3K/Shp2) in determining Akt phosphorylation profiles. It also showed that
      kinetic parameters responsible for transient Gab2 binding affect the system at
      specific nodes. This model can be expanded to study multiple signaling contexts
      and receptor crosstalk and can form a basis for investigation of therapeutic
      approaches, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), overexpression of key
      signaling proteins or knockdown experiments.

TI  - A Role of TGFß1 Dependent 14-3-3σ Phosphorylation at Ser69 and Ser74 in the
      Regulation of Gene Transcription, Stemness and Radioresistance.
LID - e65163
AB  - Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) is a potent regulator of tumorigenesis,
      although mechanisms defining its tumor suppressing and tumor promoting activities
      are not understood. Here we describe phosphoproteome profiling of TGFβ signaling 
      in mammary epithelial cells, and show that 60 identified TGFβ-regulated
      phosphoproteins form a network with scale-free characteristics. The network
      highlighted interactions, which may distribute signaling inputs to regulation of 
      cell proliferation, metabolism, differentiation and cell organization. In this
      report, we identified two novel and TGFβ-dependent phosphorylation sites of
      14-3-3σ, i.e. Ser69 and Ser74. We observed that 14-3-3σ phosphorylation is a
      feed-forward mechanism in TGFβ/Smad3-dependent transcription. TGFβ-dependent
      14-3-3σ phosphorylation may provide a scaffold for the formation of the protein
      complexes which include Smad3 and p53 at the Smad3-specific CAGA element.
      Furthermore, breast tumor xenograft studies in mice and radiobiological assays
      showed that phosphorylation of 14-3-3σ at Ser69 and Ser74 is involved in
      regulation of cancer progenitor population and radioresistance in breast cancer
      MCF7 cells. Our data suggest that TGFβ-dependent phosphorylation of 14-3-3σ
      orchestrates a functional interaction of TGFβ/Smad3 with p53, plays a role in the
      maintenance of cancer stem cells and could provide a new potential target for
      intervention in breast cancer.

TI  - Involvement of Phosphorylation of Adenosine 5′-Monophosphate-Activated Protein
      Kinase in PTTH-Stimulated Ecdysteroidogenesis in Prothoracic Glands of the
      Silkworm, Bombyx mori.
LID - e63102
AB  - In this study, we investigated inhibition of the phosphorylation of adenosine
      5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by prothoracicotropic hormone
      (PTTH) in prothoracic glands of the silkworm, Bombyx mori. We found that
      treatment with PTTH in vitro inhibited AMPK phosphorylation in time- and
      dose-dependent manners, as seen on Western blots of glandular lysates probed with
      antibody directed against AMPKα phosphorylated at Thr172. Moreover, in vitro
      inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation by PTTH was also verified by in vivo
      experiments: injection of PTTH into day 7 last instar larvae greatly inhibited
      glandular AMPK phosphorylation. PTTH-inhibited AMPK phosphorylation appeared to
      be partially reversed by treatment with LY294002, indicating involvement of
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. A chemical activator of AMPK
      (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside, AICAR) increased both basal
      and PTTH-inhibited AMPK phosphorylation. Treatment with AICAR also inhibited
      PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroidogenesis of prothoracic glands. The mechanism
      underlying inhibition of PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroidogenesis by AICAR was further
      investigated by determining the phosphorylation of eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) 
      and p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K), two known downstream signaling targets
      of the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). Upon treatment with AICAR,
      decreases in PTTH-stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP and S6K were detected. In
      addition, treatment with AICAR did not affect PTTH-stimulated extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, indicating that AMPK
      phosphorylation is not upstream signaling for ERK phosphorylation. Examination of
      gene expression levels of AMPKα, β, and γ by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
      showed that PTTH did not affect AMPK transcription. From these results, it is
      assumed that inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation, which lies upstream of
      PTTH-stimulated TOR signaling, may play a role in PTTH stimulation of
      ecdysteroidogenesis.

TI  - Novel Binding Partners and Differentially Regulated Phosphorylation Sites Clarify
      Eps8 as a Multi-Functional Adaptor.
LID - e61513
AB  - Eps8 is involved in both cell signalling and receptor trafficking. It is a known 
      phosphorylation substrate for two proteins involved in the fibroblast growth
      factor receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway: the receptor itself and Src. Here we
      report a differential proteomic analysis of Eps8 aimed to identify specific FGFR 
      and Src family kinase dependent phosphosites and co-associated phosphodependent
      binding partners. This study reveals a total of 22 Eps8 pTyr and pSer/Thr
      phosphorylation sites, including those that are dependent on Src family and FGFR 
      kinase activity. Peptide affinity purification of proteins that bind to a
      selection of the pTyr phosphosites has identified a range of novel Eps8 binding
      partners including members of the intracellular vesicle trafficking machinery
      (clathrin and AP-2), proteins which have been shown to regulate activated
      receptor trafficking (NBR1 and Vav2), and proteins involved in receptor
      signalling (IRS4 and Shp2). Collectively this study significantly extends the
      understanding of Eps8 post-translational modification by regulated
      phosphorylation, identifies novel Eps8 binding partners implicated in receptor
      trafficking and signalling, and confirms the functions of Eps8 at the nexus of
      receptor signalling and vesicular trafficking.

TI  - Phosphorylation of mRNA Decapping Protein Dcp1a by the ERK Signaling Pathway
      during Early Differentiation of 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes.
LID - e61697
AB  - Background: Turnover of mRNA is a critical step in the regulation of gene
      expression, and an important step in mRNA decay is removal of the 5′ cap. We
      previously demonstrated that the expression of some immediate early gene mRNAs is
      controlled by RNA stability during early differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes.
      Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that the mouse decapping protein
      Dcp1a is phosphorylated via the ERK signaling pathway during early
      differentiation of preadipocytes. Mass spectrometry analysis and site-directed
      mutagenesis combined with a kinase assay identified ERK pathway–mediated dual
      phosphorylation at Ser 315 and Ser 319 of Dcp1a. To understand the functional
      effects of Dcp1a phosphorylation, we examined protein-protein interactions
      between Dcp1a and other decapping components with co-immunoprecipitation. Dcp1a
      interacted with Ddx6 and Edc3 through its proline-rich C-terminal extension,
      whereas the conserved EVH1 (enabled vasodilator-stimulated protein homology 1)
      domain in the N terminus of Dcp1a showed a stronger interaction with Dcp2. Once
      ERK signaling was activated, the interaction between Dcp1a and Ddx6, Edc3, or
      Edc4 was not affected by Dcp1a phosphorylation. Phosphorylated Dcp1a did,
      however, enhanced interaction with Dcp2. Protein complexes immunoprecipitated
      with the recombinant phosphomimetic Dcp1a(S315D/S319D) mutant contained more Dcp2
      than did those immunoprecipitated with the nonphosphorylated Dcp1a(S315A/S319A)
      mutant. In addition, Dcp1a associated with AU-rich element (ARE)-containing mRNAs
      such as MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), whose mRNA stability was analyzed under the
      overexpression of Dcp1a constructs in the Dcp1a knockdown 3T3-L1 cells.
      Conclusions/Significance: Our findings suggest that ERK-phosphorylated Dcp1a
      enhances its interaction with the decapping enzyme Dcp2 during early
      differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells.

      MAPK/ERK-mediated signal transduction of gastric cancer cell line BGC-823,
      suggesting that PKG II might inhibit other EGFR-triggered signal transduction
      pathways and related biological activities of gastric cancer cells. This paper
      was designed to investigate the potential inhibition of PKG II on
      EGF/EGFR-induced migration activity and the related signal transduction pathways.
      Methodology/Principal Findings: In gastric cancer cell line AGS, expression and
      activity of PKG II were increased by infecting the cells with adenoviral
      construct encoding PKG II cDNA (Ad-PKG II) and treating the cells with cGMP
      analogue 8-pCPT-cGMP. Phosphorylation of proteins was detected by Western
      Blotting and active small G protein Ras and Rac1 was measured by “Pull-down”
      method. Cell migration activity was detected with trans-well equipment. Binding
      between PKG II and EGFR was detected with Co-IP. The results showed EGF
      stimulated migration of AGS cell and the effect was related to PLCγ1 and
      ERK-mediated signal transduction pathways. PKG II inhibited EGF-induced migration
      activity and blocked EGF-initiated signal transduction of PLCγ1 and
      MAPK/ERK-mediated pathways through preventing EGF-induced Tyr 992 and Tyr 1068
      phosphorylation of EGFR. PKG II bound with EGFR and caused threonine
      phosphorylation of it. Conclusion/Significance: Our results systemically confirms
      the inhibition of PKG II on EGF-induced migration and related signal transduction
      of PLCγ1 and MAPK/ERK-mediated pathways, indicating that PKG II has a fargoing
      inhibition on EGF/EGFR related signal transduction and biological activities of
      gastric cancer cells through phosphorylating EGFR and blocking the activation of 
      it.

TI  - Global Analysis of Neuronal Phosphoproteome Regulation by Chondroitin Sulfate
      Proteoglycans.
LID - e59285
AB  - Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are major components of the
      extracellular matrix which mediate inhibition of axonal regeneration after injury
      to the central nervous system (CNS). Several neuronal receptors for CSPGs have
      recently been identified; however, the signaling pathways by which CSPGs restrict
      axonal growth are still largely unknown. In this study, we applied quantitative
      phosphoproteomics to investigate the global changes in protein phosphorylation
      induced by CSPGs in primary neurons. In combination with isobaric Tags for
      Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling, strong cation exchange
      chromatography (SCX) fractionation, immobilized metal affinity chromatography
      (IMAC) and LC-MS/MS, we identified and quantified 2214 unique phosphopeptides
      corresponding to 1118 phosphoproteins, with 118 changing significantly in
      abundance with CSPG treatment. The proteins that were regulated by CSPGs included
      key components of synaptic vesicle trafficking, axon guidance mediated by
      semaphorins, integrin signaling, cadherin signaling and EGF receptor signaling
      pathways. A significant number of the regulated proteins are cytoskeletal and
      related proteins that have been implicated in regulating neurite growth. Another 
      highly represented protein category regulated by CSPGs is nucleic acid binding
      proteins involved in RNA post-transcriptional regulation. Together, by screening 
      the overall phosphoproteome changes induced by CSPGs, this data expand our
      understanding of CSPG signaling, which provides new insights into development of 
      strategies for overcoming CSPG inhibition and promoting axonal regeneration after
      CNS injury.

TI  - Mapping of p140Cap Phosphorylation Sites: The EPLYA and EGLYA Motifs Have a Key
      Role in Tyrosine Phosphorylation and Csk Binding, and Are Substrates of the Abl
      Kinase.
LID - e54931
AB  - Protein phosphorylation tightly regulates specific binding of effector proteins
      that control many diverse biological functions of cells (e. g. signaling,
      migration and proliferation). p140Cap is an adaptor protein, specifically
      expressed in brain, testis and epithelial cells, that undergoes phosphorylation
      and tunes its interactions with other regulatory molecules via post-translation
      modification. In this work, using mass spectrometry, we found that p140Cap is in 
      vivo phosphorylated on tyrosine (Y) within the peptide GEGLpYADPYGLLHEGR (from
      now on referred to as EGLYA) as well as on three serine residues. Consistently,
      EGLYA has the highest score of in silico prediction of p140Cap phosphorylation.
      To further investigate the p140Cap function, we performed site specific
      mutagenesis on tyrosines inserted in EGLYA and EPLYA, a second sequence with the 
      same highest score of phosphorylation. The mutant protein, in which both
      EPLYA/EGLYA tyrosines were converted to phenylalanine, was no longer tyrosine
      phosphorylated, despite the presence of other tyrosine residues in p140Cap
      sequence. Moreover, this mutant lost its ability to bind the C-terminal Src
      kinase (Csk), previously shown to interact with p140Cap by Far Western analysis. 
      In addition, we found that in vitro and in HEK-293 cells, the Abelson kinase is
      the major kinase involved in p140Cap tyrosine phosphorylation on the EPLYA and
      EGLYA sequences. Overall, these data represent an original attempt to in vivo
      characterise phosphorylated residues of p140Cap. Elucidating the function of
      p140Cap will provide novel insights into its biological activity not only in
      normal cells, but also in tumors.

TI  - A Telomerase Immortalized Human Proximal Tubule Cell Line with a Truncation
      Mutation (Q4004X) in Polycystin-1.
LID - e55191
AB  - Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is associated with a variety
      of cellular phenotypes in renal epithelial cells. Cystic epithelia are secretory 
      as opposed to absorptive, have higher proliferation rates in cell culture and
      have some characteristics of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions [1], [2]. In
      this communication we describe a telomerase immortalized cell line that expresses
      proximal tubule markers and is derived from renal cysts of an ADPKD kidney. These
      cells have a single detectable truncating mutation (Q4004X) in polycystin-1.
      These cells make normal appearing but shorter cilia and fail to assemble
      polycystin-1 in the cilia, and less uncleaved polycystin-1 in membrane fractions.
      This cell line has been maintained in continuous passage for over 35 passages
      without going into senescence. Nephron segment specific markers suggest a
      proximal tubule origin for these cells and the cell line will be useful to study 
      mechanistic details of cyst formation in proximal tubule cells.

TI  - A Quantitative Proteomic Analysis Uncovers the Relevance of CUL3 in Bladder
      Cancer Aggressiveness.
LID - e53328
AB  - To identify aggressiveness-associated molecular mechanisms and biomarker
      candidates in bladder cancer, we performed a SILAC (Stable Isotope Labelling by
      Amino acids in Cell culture) proteomic analysis comparing an invasive T24 and an 
      aggressive metastatic derived T24T bladder cancer cell line. A total of 289
      proteins were identified differentially expressed between these cells with high
      confidence. Complementary and validation analyses included comparison of protein 
      SILAC data with mRNA expression ratios obtained from oligonucleotide microarrays,
      and immunoblotting. Cul3, an overexpressed protein in T24T, involved in the
      ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, was
      selected for further investigation. Functional analyses revealed that Cul3
      silencing diminished proliferative, migration and invasive rates of T24T cells,
      and restored the expression of cytoskeleton proteins identified to be
      underexpressed in T24T cells by SILAC, such as ezrin, moesin, filamin or
      caveolin. Cul3 immunohistochemical protein patterns performed on bladder tumours 
      spotted onto tissue microarrays (n = 284), were associated with tumor staging,
      lymph node metastasis and disease-specific survival. Thus, the SILAC approach
      identified that Cul3 modulated the aggressive phenotype of T24T cells by
      modifying the expression of cytoskeleton proteins involved in bladder cancer
      aggressiveness; and played a biomarker role for bladder cancer progression, nodal
      metastasis and clinical outcome assessment.

TI  - Characterization of the Phosphoproteome in SLE Patients.
LID - e53129
AB  - Protein phosphorylation is a complex regulatory event that is involved in the
      signaling networks that affect virtually every cellular process. The protein
      phosphorylation may be a novel source for discovering biomarkers and drug
      targets. However, a systematic analysis of the phosphoproteome in patients with
      SLE has not been performed. To clarify the pathogenesis of systemic lupus
      erythematosus (SLE), we compared phosphoprotein expression in PBMCs from SLE
      patients and normal subjects using proteomics analyses. Phosphopeptides were
      enriched using TiO2 from PBMCs isolated from 15 SLE patients and 15 healthy
      subjects and then analyzed by automated LC-MS/MS analysis. Phosphorylation sites 
      were identified and quantitated by MASCOT and MaxQuant. A total of 1035
      phosphorylation sites corresponding to 618 NCBI-annotated genes were identified
      in SLE patients compared with normal subjects. Differentially expressed proteins,
      peptides and phosphorylation sites were then subjected to bioinformatics
      analyses. Gene ontology(GO) and pathway analyses showed that nucleic acid
      metabolism, cellular component organization, transport and multicellular
      organismal development pathways made up the largest proportions of the
      differentially expressed genes. Pathway analyses showed that the
      mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway and actin cytoskeleton 
      regulators made up the largest proportions of the metabolic pathways. Network
      analysis showed that rous sarcoma oncogene (SRC), v-rel reticuloendotheliosis
      viral oncogene homolog A (RELA), histone deacetylase (HDA1C) and protein kinase
      C, delta (PRKCD) play important roles in the stability of the network. These data
      suggest that aberrant protein phosphorylation may contribute to SLE pathogenesis.

TI  - Quantitative Phosphoproteomics Reveals SLP-76 Dependent Regulation of PAG and Src
      Family Kinases in T Cells.
LID - e46725
AB  - The SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) plays a critical
      scaffolding role in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. As an adaptor protein that
      contains multiple protein-binding domains, SLP-76 interacts with many signaling
      molecules and links proximal receptor stimulation to downstream effectors. The
      function of SLP-76 in TCR signaling has been widely studied using the Jurkat
      human leukaemic T cell line through protein disruption or site-directed
      mutagenesis. However, a wide-scale characterization of SLP-76-dependant
      phosphorylation events is still lacking. Quantitative profiling of over a hundred
      tyrosine phosphorylation sites revealed new modes of regulation of
      phosphorylation of PAG, PI3K, and WASP while reconfirming previously established 
      regulation of Itk, PLCγ, and Erk phosphorylation by SLP-76. The absence of SLP-76
      also perturbed the phosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFKs) Lck and Fyn, and 
      subsequently a large number of SFK-regulated signaling molecules. Altogether our 
      data suggests unique modes of regulation of positive and negative feedback
      pathways in T cells by SLP-76, reconfirming its central role in the pathway.

TI  - The Weak Complex between RhoGAP Protein ARHGAP22 and Signal Regulatory Protein
      14-3-3 Has 1∶2 Stoichiometry and a Single Peptide Binding Mode.
LID - e41731
AB  - ARHGAP22 is a RhoGAP protein comprising an N-terminal PH domain, a RhoGAP domain 
      and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain. It has recently been identified as an Akt
      substrate that binds 14-3-3 proteins in response to treatment with growth factors
      involved in cell migration. We used a range of biophysical techniques to
      investigate the weak interaction between 14-3-3 and a truncated form of ARHGAP22 
      lacking the coiled-coil domain. This weak interaction could be stabilized by
      chemical cross-linking which we used to show that: a monomer of ARHGAP22 binds a 
      dimer of 14-3-3; the ARHGAP22 PH domain is required for the 14-3-3 interaction;
      the RhoGAP domain is unlikely to participate in the interaction; Ser16 is the
      more important of two predicted 14-3-3 binding sites; and, phosphorylation of
      Ser16 may not be necessary for 14-3-3 interaction under the conditions we used.
      Small angle X-ray scattering and cross-link information were used to generate
      solution structures of the isolated proteins and of the cross-linked
      ARHGAP22:14-3-3 complex, showing that no major rearrangement occurs in either
      protein upon binding, and supporting a role for the PH domain and N-terminal
      peptide of ARHGAP22 in the 14-3-3 interaction. Small-angle X-ray scattering
      measurements of mixtures of ARHGAP22 and 14-3-3 were used to establish that the
      affinity of the interaction is ∼30 µM.

TI  - Mathematical Modelling of the MAP Kinase Pathway Using Proteomic Datasets.
LID - e42230
AB  - The advances in proteomics technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity and
      valuable resources to understand how living organisms execute necessary functions
      at systems levels. However, little work has been done up to date to utilize the
      highly accurate spatio-temporal dynamic proteome data generated by
      phosphoprotemics for mathematical modeling of complex cell signaling pathways.
      This work proposed a novel computational framework to develop mathematical models
      based on proteomic datasets. Using the MAP kinase pathway as the test system, we 
      developed a mathematical model including the cytosolic and nuclear subsystems;
      and applied the genetic algorithm to infer unknown model parameters. Robustness
      property of the mathematical model was used as a criterion to select the
      appropriate rate constants from the estimated candidates. Quantitative
      information regarding the absolute protein concentrations was used to refine the 
      mathematical model. We have demonstrated that the incorporation of more
      experimental data could significantly enhance both the simulation accuracy and
      robustness property of the proposed model. In addition, we used the MAP kinase
      pathway inhibited by phosphatases with different concentrations to predict the
      signal output influenced by different cellular conditions. Our predictions are in
      good agreement with the experimental observations when the MAP kinase pathway was
      inhibited by phosphatase PP2A and MKP3. The successful application of the
      proposed modeling framework to the MAP kinase pathway suggests that our method is
      very promising for developing accurate mathematical models and yielding insights 
      into the regulatory mechanisms of complex cell signaling pathways.

TI  - First Insight into the Kinome of Human Regulatory T Cells.
LID - e40896
AB  - Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are essential for controlling peripheral tolerance by 
      the active suppression of various immune cells including conventional T effector 
      cells (Teffs). Downstream of the T cell receptor (TCR), more than 500 protein
      kinases encoded by the human genome have to be considered in signaling cascades
      regulating the activation of Tregs and Teffs, respectively. Following TCR
      engagement, Tregs posses a number of unique attributes, such as constitutive
      expression of Foxp3, hyporesponsiveness and poor cytokine production.
      Furthermore, recent studies showed that altered regulation of protein kinases is 
      important for Treg function. These data indicate that signaling pathways in Tregs
      are distinctly organized and alterations at the level of protein kinases
      contribute to the unique Treg phenotype. However, kinase-based signaling networks
      in Tregs are poorly understood and necessitate further systematic
      characterization. In this study, we analyzed the differential expression of
      kinases in Tregs and Teffs by using a kinase-selective proteome strategy. In
      total, we revealed quantitative information on 185 kinases expressed in the human
      CD4+ T cell subsets. The majority of kinases was equally abundant in both T cell 
      subsets, but 11 kinases were differentially expressed in Tregs. Most strikingly, 
      Tregs showed an altered expression of cell cycle kinases including CDK6.
      Quantitative proteomics generates first comparative insight into the kinase
      complements of the CD4+ Teff and Treg subset. Treg-specific expression pattern of
      11 protein kinases substantiate the current opinion that TCR-mediated signaling
      cascades are altered in Tregs and further suggests that Tregs exhibit significant
      specificities in cell-cycle control and progression.

TI  - Identifying Biological Network Structure, Predicting Network Behavior, and
      Classifying Network State With High Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR).
LID - e37664
AB  - This work presents an adapted Random Sampling - High Dimensional Model
      Representation (RS-HDMR) algorithm for synergistically addressing three key
      problems in network biology: (1) identifying the structure of biological networks
      from multivariate data, (2) predicting network response under previously
      unsampled conditions, and (3) inferring experimental perturbations based on the
      observed network state. RS-HDMR is a multivariate regression method that
      decomposes network interactions into a hierarchy of non-linear component
      functions. Sensitivity analysis based on these functions provides a clear
      physical and statistical interpretation of the underlying network structure. The 
      advantages of RS-HDMR include efficient extraction of nonlinear and cooperative
      network relationships without resorting to discretization, prediction of network 
      behavior without mechanistic modeling, robustness to data noise, and favorable
      scalability of the sampling requirement with respect to network size. As a
      proof-of-principle study, RS-HDMR was applied to experimental data measuring the 
      single-cell response of a protein-protein signaling network to various
      experimental perturbations. A comparison to network structure identified in the
      literature and through other inference methods, including Bayesian and
      mutual-information based algorithms, suggests that RS-HDMR can successfully
      reveal a network structure with a low false positive rate while still capturing
      non-linear and cooperative interactions. RS-HDMR identified several higher-order 
      network interactions that correspond to known feedback regulations among multiple
      network species and that were unidentified by other network inference methods.
      Furthermore, RS-HDMR has a better ability to predict network response under
      unsampled conditions in this application than the best statistical inference
      algorithm presented in the recent DREAM3 signaling-prediction competition.
      RS-HDMR can discern and predict differences in network state that arise from
      sources ranging from intrinsic cell-cell variability to altered experimental
      conditions, such as when drug perturbations are introduced. This ability
      ultimately allows RS-HDMR to accurately classify the experimental conditions of a
      given sample based on its observed network state.

TI  - The IkappaB Kinase Family Phosphorylates the Parkinson’s Disease Kinase LRRK2 at 
      Ser935 and Ser910 during Toll-Like Receptor Signaling.
LID - e39132
AB  - Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are strongly associated with
      late-onset autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 is highly expressed in
      immune cells and recent work points towards a link between LRRK2 and innate
      immunity. Here we demonstrate that stimulation of the Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)
      pathway by MyD88-dependent agonists in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or
      RAW264.7 macrophages induces marked phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser910 and
      Ser935, the phosphorylation sites that regulate the binding of 14-3-3 to LRRK2.
      Phosphorylation of these residues is prevented by knock-out of MyD88 in BMDMs,
      but not the alternative TLR adaptor protein TRIF. Utilising both pharmacological 
      inhibitors, including a new TAK1 inhibitor, NG25, and genetic models, we provide 
      evidence that both the canonical (IKKα and IKKβ) and IKK-related (IKKε and TBK1) 
      kinases mediate TLR agonist induced phosphorylation of LRRK2 in vivo. Moreover,
      all four IKK members directly phosphorylate LRRK2 at Ser910 and Ser935 in vitro. 
      Consistent with previous work describing Ser910 and Ser935 as pharmacodynamic
      biomarkers of LRRK2 activity, we find that the TLR independent basal
      phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser910 and Ser935 is abolished following treatment of
      macrophages with LRRK2 kinase inhibitors. However, the increased phosphorylation 
      of Ser910 and Ser935 induced by activation of the MyD88 pathway is insensitive to
      LRRK2 kinase inhibitors. Finally, employing LRRK2-deficient BMDMs, we present
      data indicating that LRRK2 does not play a major role in regulating the secretion
      of inflammatory cytokines induced by activation of the MyD88 pathway. Our
      findings provide the first direct link between LRRK2 and the IKKs that mediate
      many immune responses. Further work is required to uncover the physiological
      roles that phosphorylation of LRRK2 by IKKs play in controlling macrophage
      biology and to determine how phosphorylation of LRRK2 by IKKs impacts upon the
      use of Ser910 and Ser935 as pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

TI  - Increased Urinary Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 in Renal Transplant Patients
      with Diabetes.
LID - e37649
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expressed in the kidney and may be a
      renoprotective enzyme, since it converts angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7). ACE2 
      has been detected in urine from patients with chronic kidney disease. We measured
      urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels in renal transplant patients (age 54
      yrs, 65% male, 38% diabetes, n = 100) and healthy controls (age 45 yrs, 26% male,
      n = 50), and determined factors associated with elevated urinary ACE2 in the
      patients. Urine from transplant subjects was also assayed for ACE mRNA and
      protein. No subjects were taking inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system.
      Urinary ACE2 levels were significantly higher in transplant patients compared to 
      controls (p = 0.003 for ACE2 activity, and p≤0.001 for ACE2 protein by ELISA or
      western analysis). Transplant patients with diabetes mellitus had significantly
      increased urinary ACE2 activity and protein levels compared to non-diabetics
      (p<0.001), while ACE2 mRNA levels did not differ. Urinary ACE activity and
      protein were significantly increased in diabetic transplant subjects, while ACE
      mRNA levels did not differ from non-diabetic subjects. After adjusting for
      confounding variables, diabetes was significantly associated with urinary ACE2
      activity (p = 0.003) and protein levels (p<0.001), while female gender was
      associated with urinary mRNA levels for both ACE2 and ACE. These data indicate
      that urinary ACE2 is increased in renal transplant recipients with diabetes,
      possibly due to increased shedding from tubular cells. Urinary ACE2 could be a
      marker of renal renin-angiotensin system activation in these patients.

TI  - A Novel Classification of Lung Cancer into Molecular Subtypes.
LID - e31906
AB  - The remarkably heterogeneous nature of lung cancer has become more apparent over 
      the last decade. In general, advanced lung cancer is an aggressive malignancy
      with a poor prognosis. The discovery of multiple molecular mechanisms underlying 
      the development, progression, and prognosis of lung cancer, however, has created 
      new opportunities for targeted therapy and improved outcome. In this paper, we
      define “molecular subtypes” of lung cancer based on specific actionable genetic
      aberrations. Each subtype is associated with molecular tests that define the
      subtype and drugs that may potentially treat it. We hope this paper will be a
      useful guide to clinicians and researchers alike by assisting in therapy decision
      making and acting as a platform for further study. In this new era of cancer
      treatment, the ‘one-size-fits-all’ paradigm is being forcibly pushed
      aside—allowing for more effective, personalized oncologic care to emerge.

TI  - Phosphorylation Provides a Negative Mode of Regulation for the Yeast Rab GTPase
      Sec4p.
LID - e24332
AB  - The Rab family of Ras-related GTPases are part of a complex signaling circuitry
      in eukaryotic cells, yet we understand little about the mechanisms that underlie 
      Rab protein participation in such signal transduction networks, or how these
      networks are integrated at the physiological level. Reversible protein
      phosphorylation is widely used by cells as a signaling mechanism. Several
      phospho-Rabs have been identified, however the functional consequences of the
      modification appear to be diverse and need to be evaluated on an individual
      basis. In this study we demonstrate a role for phosphorylation as a negative
      regulatory event for the action of the yeast Rab GTPase Sec4p in regulating
      polarized growth. Our data suggest that the phosphorylation of the Rab Sec4p
      prevents interactions with its effector, the exocyst component Sec15p, and that
      the inhibition may be relieved by a PP2A phosphatase complex containing the
      regulatory subunit Cdc55p.

TI  - Identification of a Phosphorylation-Dependent Nuclear Localization Motif in
      Interferon Regulatory Factor 2 Binding Protein 2.
LID - e24100
AB  - Background: Interferon regulatory factor 2 binding protein 2 (IRF2BP2) is a
      muscle-enriched transcription factor required to activate vascular endothelial
      growth factor-A (VEGFA) expression in muscle. IRF2BP2 is found in the nucleus of 
      cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. During the process of skeletal muscle
      differentiation, some IRF2BP2 becomes relocated to the cytoplasm, although the
      functional significance of this relocation and the mechanisms that control
      nucleocytoplasmic localization of IRF2BP2 are not yet known.
      Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, by fusing IRF2BP2 to green fluorescent
      protein and testing a series of deletion and site-directed mutagenesis
      constructs, we mapped the nuclear localization signal (NLS) to an evolutionarily 
      conserved sequence 354ARKRKPSP361 in IRF2BP2. This sequence corresponds to a
      classical nuclear localization motif bearing positively charged arginine and
      lysine residues. Substitution of arginine and lysine with negatively charged
      aspartic acid residues blocked nuclear localization. However, these residues were
      not sufficient because nuclear targeting of IRF2BP2 also required phosphorylation
      of serine 360 (S360). Many large-scale phosphopeptide proteomic studies had
      reported previously that serine 360 of IRF2BP2 is phosphorylated in numerous
      human cell types. Alanine substitution at this site abolished IRF2BP2 nuclear
      localization in C2C12 myoblasts and CV1 cells. In contrast, substituting serine
      360 with aspartic acid forced nuclear retention and prevented cytoplasmic
      redistribution in differentiated C2C12 muscle cells. As for the effects of these 
      mutations on VEGFA promoter activity, the S360A mutation interfered with VEGFA
      activation, as expected. Surprisingly, the S360D mutation also interfered with
      VEGFA activation, suggesting that this mutation, while enforcing nuclear entry,
      may disrupt an essential activation function of IRF2BP2.
      Conclusions/Significance: Nuclear localization of IRF2BP2 depends on
      phosphorylation near a conserved NLS. Changes in phosphorylation status likely
      control nucleocytoplasmic localization of IRF2BP2 during muscle differentiation.

TI  - Phosphoproteomics Identifies Oncogenic Ras Signaling Targets and Their
      Involvement in Lung Adenocarcinomas.
LID - e20199
AB  - Background: Ras is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers, including
      lung cancer, leading to constitutive activation of MAPK signaling. Despite
      decades of research focused on the Ras oncogene, Ras-targeted phosphorylation
      events and signaling pathways have not been described on a proteome-wide scale.
      Methodology/Principal Findings: By functional phosphoproteomics, we studied the
      molecular mechanics of oncogenic Ras signaling using a pathway-based approach. We
      identified Ras-regulated phosphorylation events (n = 77) using label-free
      comparative proteomics analysis of immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells 
      with and without the expression of oncogenic Ras. Many were newly identified as
      potential targets of the Ras signaling pathway. A majority (∼60%) of the
      Ras-targeted events consisted of a [pSer/Thr]-Pro motif, indicating the
      involvement of proline-directed kinases. By integrating the phosphorylated
      signatures into the Pathway Interaction Database, we further inferred
      Ras-regulated pathways, including MAPK signaling and other novel cascades, in
      governing diverse functions such as gene expression, apoptosis, cell growth, and 
      RNA processing. Comparisons of Ras-regulated phosphorylation events, pathways,
      and related kinases in lung cancer-derived cells supported a role of oncogenic
      Ras signaling in lung adenocarcinoma A549 and H322 cells, but not in large cell
      carcinoma H1299 cells. Conclusions/Significance: This study reveals
      phosphorylation events, signaling networks, and molecular functions that are
      regulated by oncogenic Ras. The results observed in this study may aid to extend 
      our knowledge on Ras signaling in lung cancer.

TI  - The Participation of Calponin in the Cross Talk between 20-Hydroxyecdysone and
      Juvenile Hormone Signaling Pathways by Phosphorylation Variation.
LID - e19776
AB  - 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone (JH) signaling pathways interact to
      mediate insect development, but the mechanism of this interaction is poorly
      understood. Here, a calponin homologue domain (Chd) containing protein (HaCal) is
      reported to play a key role in the cross talk between 20E and JH signaling by
      varying its phosphorylation. Chd is known as an actin binding domain present in
      many proteins including some signaling proteins. Using an epidermal cell line
      (HaEpi), HaCal was found to be up-regulated by either 20E or the JH analog
      methoprene (JHA). 20E induced rapid phosphorylation of HaCal whereas no
      phosphorylation occurred with JHA. HaCal could be quickly translocated into the
      nuclei through 20E or JH signaling but interacted with USP1 only under the
      mediation of JHA. Knockdown of HaCal by RNAi blocked the 20E inducibility of
      USP1, PKC and HR3, and also blocked the JHA inducibility of USP1, PKC and JHi.
      After gene silencing of HaCal by ingestion of dsHaCal expressed by Escherichia
      coli, the larval development was arrested and the gene expression of USP1, PKC,
      HR3 and JHi were blocked. These composite data suggest that HaCal plays roles in 
      hormonal signaling by quickly transferring into nucleus to function as a
      phosphorylated form in the 20E pathway and as a non-phosphorylated form
      interacting with USP1 in the JH pathway to facilitate 20E or JH signaling
      cascade, in short, by switching its phosphorylation status to regulate insect
      development.

TI  - Identification of Phosphoproteins as Possible Differentiation Markers in
      All-Trans-Retinoic Acid-Treated Neuroblastoma Cells.
LID - e18254
AB  - Background: Neuroblastic tumors account for 9–10% of pediatric tumors and
      neuroblastoma (NB) is the first cause of death in pre-school age children. NB is 
      classified in four stages, depending on the extent of spreading. A fifth type of 
      NB, so-called stage 4S (S for special), includes patients with metastatic tumors 
      but with an overall survival that approximates 75% at five years. In most of
      these cases, the tumor regresses spontaneously and regression is probably
      associated with delayed neuroblast cell differentiation. Methodology/Principal
      Findings: In order to identify new early markers to follow and predict this
      process for diagnostic and therapeutics intents, we mimicked the differentiation 
      process treating NB cell line SJ-NK-P with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) at
      different times; therefore the cell proteomic pattern by mass spectrometry and
      the phosphoproteomic pattern by a 2-DE approach coupled with anti-phosphoserine
      and anti-phosphotyrosine western blotting were studied. Conclusions/Significance:
      Proteomic analysis identified only two proteins whose expression was
      significantly different in treated cells versus control cells: nucleoside
      diphosphate kinase A (NDKA) and reticulocalbin-1 (RCN1), which were both
      downregulated after 9 days of ATRA treatment. However, phosphoproteomic analysis 
      identified 8 proteins that were differentially serine-phosphorylated and 3 that
      were differentially tyrosine-phosphorylated after ATRA treatment. All proteins
      were significantly regulated (at least 0.5-fold down-regulated). Our results
      suggest that differentially phosphorylated proteins could be considered as more
      promising markers of differentiation for NB than differentially expressed
      proteins.

TI  - Survey of Activated FLT3 Signaling in Leukemia.
LID - e19169
AB  - Activating mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) are found in
      approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3 is
      therefore an attractive drug target. However, the molecular mechanisms by which
      FLT3 mutations lead to cell transformation in AML remain unclear. To develop a
      better understanding of FLT3 signaling as well as its downstream effectors, we
      performed detailed phosphoproteomic analysis of FLT3 signaling in human leukemia 
      cells. We identified over 1000 tyrosine phosphorylation sites from about 750
      proteins in both AML (wild type and mutant FLT3) and B cell acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (normal and amplification of FLT3) cell lines. Furthermore, using stable
      isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), we were able to
      quantified over 400 phosphorylation sites (pTyr, pSer, and pThr) that were
      responsive to FLT3 inhibition in FLT3 driven human leukemia cell lines. We also
      extended this phosphoproteomic analysis on bone marrow from primary AML patient
      samples, and identify over 200 tyrosine and 800 serine/threonine phosphorylation 
      sites in vivo. This study showed that oncogenic FLT3 regulates proteins involving
      diverse cellular processes and affects multiple signaling pathways in human
      leukemia that we previously appreciated, such as Fc epsilon RI-mediated
      signaling, BCR, and CD40 signaling pathways. It provides a valuable resource for 
      investigation of oncogenic FLT3 signaling in human leukemia.

TI  - Biased Signaling of the Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Can Be Mediated through
      Distinct Mechanisms.
LID - e14135
AB  - Background: Seven transmembrane receptors (7TMRs) can adopt different active
      conformations facilitating a selective activation of either G protein or
      β-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways. This represents an opportunity for
      development of novel therapeutics targeting selective biological effects of a
      given receptor. Several studies on pathway separation have been performed, many
      of these on the Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). It has been shown that
      certain ligands or mutations facilitate internalization and/or recruitment of
      β-arrestins without activation of G proteins. However, the underlying molecular
      mechanisms remain largely unresolved. For instance, it is unclear whether such
      selective G protein-uncoupling is caused by a lack of ability to interact with G 
      proteins or rather by an increased ability of the receptor to recruit
      β-arrestins. Since uncoupling of G proteins by increased ability to recruit
      β-arrestins could lead to different cellular or in vivo outcomes than lack of
      ability to interact with G proteins, it is essential to distinguish between these
      two mechanisms. Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied five AT1R mutants
      previously published to display pathway separation: D74N, DRY/AAY, Y292F, N298A, 
      and Y302F (Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering: 2.50, 3.49–3.51, 7.43, 7.49, and
      7.53). We find that D74N, DRY/AAY, and N298A mutants are more prone to β-arrestin
      recruitment than WT. In contrast, receptor mutants Y292F and Y302F showed
      impaired ability to recruit β-arrestin in response to Sar1-Ile4-Ile8 (SII) Ang
      II, a ligand solely activating the β-arrestin pathway. Conclusions/Significance: 
      Our analysis reveals that the underlying conformations induced by these AT1R
      mutants most likely represent principally different mechanisms of uncoupling the 
      G protein, which for some mutants may be due to their increased ability to
      recruit β-arrestin2. Hereby, these findings have important implications for drug 
      discovery and 7TMR biology and illustrate the necessity of uncovering the exact
      molecular determinants for G protein-coupling and β-arrestin recruitment,
      respectively.

TI  - Independent Interactions of Phosphorylated β-Catenin with E-Cadherin at Cell-Cell
      Contacts and APC at Cell Protrusions.
LID - e14127
AB  - Background: The APC tumour suppressor functions in several cellular processes
      including the regulation of β-catenin in Wnt signalling and in cell adhesion and 
      migration. Findings: In this study, we establish that in epithelial cells
      N-terminally phosphorylated β-catenin specifically localises to several
      subcellular sites including cell-cell contacts and the ends of cell protrusions. 
      N-terminally phosphorylated β-catenin associates with E-cadherin at adherens
      junctions and with APC in cell protrusions. We isolated APC-rich protrusions from
      stimulated cells and detected β-catenin, GSK3β and CK1α, but not axin. The
      APC/phospho-β-catenin complex in cell protrusions appears to be distinct from the
      APC/axin/β-catenin destruction complex. GSK3β phosphorylates the APC-associated
      population of β-catenin, but not the cell junction population. β-catenin
      associated with APC is rapidly phosphorylated and dephosphorylated. HGF and
      wound-induced cell migration promote the localised accumulation of APC and
      phosphorylated β-catenin at the leading edge of migrating cells. APC siRNA and
      analysis of colon cancer cell lines show that functional APC is required for
      localised phospho-β-catenin accumulation in cell protrusions. Conclusions: We
      conclude that N-terminal phosphorylation of β-catenin does not necessarily lead
      to its degradation but instead marks distinct functions, such as cell migration
      and/or adhesion processes. Localised regulation of APC-phospho-β-catenin
      complexes may contribute to the tumour suppressor activity of APC.

TI  - Phosphoproteomics-Based Modeling Defines the Regulatory Mechanism Underlying
      Aberrant EGFR Signaling.
LID - e13926
AB  - Background: Mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) results in a 
      discordant cell signaling, leading to the development of various diseases.
      However, the mechanism underlying the alteration of downstream signaling due to
      such mutation has not yet been completely understood at the system level. Here,
      we report a phosphoproteomics-based methodology for characterizing the regulatory
      mechanism underlying aberrant EGFR signaling using computational network
      modeling. Methodology/Principal Findings: Our phosphoproteomic analysis of the
      mutation at tyrosine 992 (Y992), one of the multifunctional docking sites of
      EGFR, revealed network-wide effects of the mutation on EGF signaling in a
      time-resolved manner. Computational modeling based on the temporal activation
      profiles enabled us to not only rediscover already-known protein interactions
      with Y992 and internalization property of mutated EGFR but also further gain
      model-driven insights into the effect of cellular content and the regulation of
      EGFR degradation. Our kinetic model also suggested critical reactions
      facilitating the reconstruction of the diverse effects of the mutation on
      phosphoproteome dynamics. Conclusions/Significance: Our integrative approach
      provided a mechanistic description of the disorders of mutated EGFR signaling
      networks, which could facilitate the development of a systematic strategy toward 
      controlling disease-related cell signaling.

TI  - Proteins Involved in Platelet Signaling Are Differentially Regulated in Acute
      Coronary Syndrome: A Proteomic Study.
LID - e13404
AB  - Background: Platelets play a fundamental role in pathological events underlying
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Because platelets do not have a nucleus,
      proteomics constitutes an optimal approach to follow platelet molecular events
      associated with the onset of the acute episode. Methodology/Principal Findings:
      We performed the first high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based 
      proteome analysis of circulating platelets from patients with non-ST segment
      elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). Proteins were identified by mass spectrometry and
      validations were by western blotting. Forty protein features (corresponding to 22
      unique genes) were found to be differentially regulated between NSTE-ACS patients
      and matched controls with chronic ischemic cardiopathy. The number of differences
      decreased at day 5 (28) and 6 months after the acute event (5). Interestingly, a 
      systems biology approach demonstrated that 16 of the 22 differentially regulated 
      proteins identified are interconnected as part of a common network related to
      cell assembly and organization and cell morphology, processes very related to
      platelet activation. Indeed, 14 of those proteins are either signaling or
      cytoskeletal, and nine of them are known to participate in platelet activation by
      αIIbβ3 and/or GPVI receptors. Several of the proteins identified participate in
      platelet activation through post-translational modifications, as shown here for
      ILK, Src and Talin. Interestingly, the platelet-secreted glycoprotein SPARC was
      down-regulated in NSTE-ACS patients compared to stable controls, which is
      consistent with a secretion process from activated platelets.
      Conclusions/Significance: The present study provides novel information on
      platelet proteome changes associated with platelet activation in NSTE-ACS,
      highlighting the presence of proteins involved in platelet signaling. This
      investigation paves the way for future studies in the search for novel
      platelet-related biomarkers and drug targets in ACS.

TI  - Raptor is Phosphorylated by cdc2 during Mitosis.
LID - e9197
AB  - Background: The appropriate control of mitotic entry and exit is reliant on a
      series of interlocking signaling events that coordinately drive the biological
      processes required for accurate cell division. Overlaid onto these signals that
      promote orchestrated cell division are checkpoints that ensure appropriate
      mitotic spindle formation, a lack of DNA damage, kinetochore attachment, and that
      each daughter cell has the appropriate complement of DNA. We recently discovered 
      that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) modulates the G2/M phase of cell cycle
      progression in part through its suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin
      (mTOR) signaling. AMPK directly phosphorylates the critical mTOR binding partner 
      raptor inhibiting mTORC1 (mTOR-raptor rapamycin sensitive mTOR kinase complex 1).
      As mTOR has been previously tied to mitotic control, we examined further how
      raptor may contribute to this process. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have
      discovered that raptor becomes highly phosphorylated in cells in mitosis.
      Utilizing tandem mass spectrometry, we identified a number of novel
      phosphorylation sites in raptor, and using phospho-specific antibodies
      demonstrated that raptor becomes phosphorylated on
      phospho-serine/threonine-proline sites in mitosis. A combination of site-directed
      mutagenesis in a tagged raptor cDNA and analysis with a series of new
      phospho-specific antibodies generated against different sites in raptor revealed 
      that Serine 696 and Threonine 706 represent two key sites in raptor
      phosphorylated in mitosis. We demonstrate that the mitotic cyclin-dependent
      kinase cdc2/CDK1 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating these sites, and
      its mitotic partner Cyclin B efficiently coimmunoprecipitates with raptor in
      mitotic cells. Conclusions/Significance: This study demonstrates that the key
      mTOR binding partner raptor is directly phosphorylated during mitosis by cdc2.
      This reinforces previous studies suggesting that mTOR activity is highly
      regulated and important for mitotic progression, and points to a direct
      modulation of the mTORC1 complex during mitosis.

TI  - Sequence Alignment Reveals Possible MAPK Docking Motifs on HIV Proteins.
LID - e8942
AB  - Over the course of HIV infection, virus replication is facilitated by the
      phosphorylation of HIV proteins by human ERK1 and ERK2 mitogen-activated protein 
      kinases (MAPKs). MAPKs are known to phosphorylate their substrates by first
      binding with them at a docking site. Docking site interactions could be viable
      drug targets because the sequences guiding them are more specific than
      phosphorylation consensus sites. In this study we use multiple bioinformatics
      tools to discover candidate MAPK docking site motifs on HIV proteins known to be 
      phosphorylated by MAPKs, and we discuss the possibility of targeting docking
      sites with drugs. Using sequence alignments of HIV proteins of different
      subtypes, we show that MAPK docking patterns previously described for human
      proteins appear on the HIV matrix, Tat, and Vif proteins in a strain dependent
      manner, but are absent from HIV Rev and appear on all HIV Nef strains. We revise 
      the regular expressions of previously annotated MAPK docking patterns in order to
      provide a subtype independent motif that annotates all HIV proteins. One revision
      is based on a documented human variant of one of the substrate docking motifs,
      and the other reduces the number of required basic amino acids in the standard
      docking motifs from two to one. The proposed patterns are shown to be consistent 
      with in silico docking between ERK1 and the HIV matrix protein. The motif usage
      on HIV proteins is sufficiently different from human proteins in amino acid
      sequence similarity to allow for HIV specific targeting using small-molecule
      drugs.

TI  - Dissecting the Signaling Events That Impact Classical Nuclear Import and Target
      Nuclear Transport Factors.
LID - e8420
AB  - Background: Signaling through MEK→ERK1/2 and PI3 kinases is implicated in many
      aspects of cell physiology, including the survival of oxidant exposure. Oxidants 
      play a role in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes, many of
      which rely on transport in and out of the nucleus. However, how oxidative stress 
      impacts nuclear trafficking is not well defined. Methodology/Principal Findings: 
      To better understand the effect of stress on nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, we
      exposed cells to the oxidant diethyl maleate. This treatment activated MEK→ERK1/2
      as well as PI3 kinase→Akt cascades and triggered the inhibition of classical
      nuclear import. To define the molecular mechanisms that regulate nuclear
      transport, we examined whether MEK and PI3 kinase signaling affected the
      localization of key transport factors. Using recently developed tools for image
      acquisition and analysis, the subcellular distributions of importin-α, CAS, and
      nucleoporins Nup153 and Nup88 were quantified in different cellular compartments.
      These studies identified specific profiles for the localization of transport
      factors in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and at the nuclear envelope. Our results
      demonstrate that MEK and PI3 kinase signaling as well as oxidative stress control
      nuclear trafficking and the localization of transport components. Furthermore,
      stress not only induced changes in transport factor distribution, but also
      upregulated post-translational modification of transport factors. Our results are
      consistent with the idea that the phosphorylation of importin-α, CAS, Nup153, and
      Nup88, and the O-GlcNAc modification of Nup153 increase when cells are exposed to
      oxidant. Conclusions/Significance: Our studies defined the complex regulation of 
      classical nuclear import and identified key transport factors that are targeted
      by stress, MEK, and PI3 kinase signaling.

TI  - Multisite Phosphorylation of the Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor Cdc24 during 
      Yeast Cell Polarization.
LID - e6563
AB  - Background: Cell polarization is essential for processes such as cell migration
      and asymmetric cell division. A common regulator of cell polarization in most
      eukaryotic cells is the conserved Rho GTPase, Cdc42. In budding yeast, Cdc42 is
      activated by a single guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Cdc24. The mechanistic 
      details of Cdc24 activation at the onset of yeast cell polarization are unclear. 
      Previous studies have suggested an important role for phosphorylation of Cdc24,
      which may regulate activity or function of the protein, representing a key step
      in the symmetry breaking process. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we
      directly ask whether multisite phosphorylation of Cdc24 plays a role in its
      regulation. We identify through mass spectrometry analysis over thirty putative
      in vivo phosphorylation sites. We first focus on sites matching consensus
      sequences for cyclin-dependent and p21-activated kinases, two kinase families
      that have been previously shown to phosphorylate Cdc24. Through site-directed
      mutagenesis, yeast genetics, and light and fluorescence microscopy, we show that 
      nonphosphorylatable mutations of these consensus sites do not lead to any
      detectable consequences on growth rate, morphology, kinetics of polarization, or 
      localization of the mutant protein. We do, however, observe a change in the
      mobility shift of mutant Cdc24 proteins on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that we have
      indeed perturbed its phosphorylation. Finally, we show that mutation of all
      identified phosphorylation sites does not cause observable defects in growth rate
      or morphology. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that lack of phosphorylation
      on Cdc24 has no overt functional consequences in budding yeast. Yeast cell
      polarization may be more tightly regulated by inactivation of Cdc42 by GTPase
      activating proteins or by alternative methods of Cdc24 regulation, such as
      conformational changes or oligomerization.

TI  - Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) Mediated Tyrosine Phosphor-Proteome from
      Drosophila S2 (ErbB1) Cells Reveals Novel Signaling Networks.
LID - e2877
AB  - Protein phosphorylation mediates many critical cellular responses and is
      essential for many biological functions during development. About one-third of
      cellular proteins are phosphorylated, representing the phosphor-proteome, and
      phosphorylation can alter a protein's function, activity, localization and
      stability. Tyrosine phosphorylation events mediated by aberrant activation of
      Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) pathways have been proven to be involved in the
      development of several diseases including cancer. To understand the systems
      biology of RTK activation, we have developed a phosphor-proteome focused on
      tyrosine phosphorylation events under insulin and EGF signaling pathways using
      the PhosphoScan® technique coupled with high-throughput mass spectrometry
      analysis. Comparative proteomic analyses of all these tyrosine phosphorylation
      events revealed that around 70% of these pY events are conserved in human
      orthologs and paralogs. A careful analysis of published in vivo tyrosine
      phosphorylation events from literature and patents revealed that around 38% of pY
      events from Drosophila proteins conserved on 185 human proteins are confirmed in 
      vivo tyrosine phosphorylation events. Hence the data are validated partially
      based on available reports, and the credibility of the remaining 62% of novel
      conserved sites that are unpublished so far is very high but requires further
      follow-up studies. The novel pY events found in this study that are conserved on 
      human proteins could potentially lead to the discovery of drug targets and
      biomarkers for the detection of various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Analysis of EGFR signaling pathway in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells by
      quantitative phosphoproteomics.
PG  - 35
AB  - Background: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is usually overexpressed 
      in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and is associated with pathogenesis of NPC.
      However, the downstream signaling proteins of EGFR in NPC have not yet been
      completely understood at the system level. The aim of this study was identify
      novel downstream proteins of EGFR signaling pathway in NPC cells. Results: We
      analyzed EGFR-regulated phosphoproteome in NPC CNE2 cells using 2D-DIGE and mass 
      spectrometry analysis after phosphoprotein enrichment. As a result, 33
      nonredundant phosphoproteins including five known EGFR-regulated proteins and
      twenty-eight novel EGFR-regulated proteins in CNE2 were identified, three
      differential phosphoproteins were selectively validated, and two differential
      phosphoproteins (GSTP1 and GRB2) were showed interacted with phospho-EGFR.
      Bioinformatics analysis showed that 32 of 33 identified proteins contain
      phosphorylation modification sites, and 17 identified proteins are signaling
      proteins. GSTP1, one of the EGFR-regulated proteins, associated with
      chemoresistance was analyzed. The results showed that GSTP1 could contribute to
      paclitaxel resistance in EGF-stimulated CNE2 cells. Furthermore, an EGFR
      signaling network based on the identified EGFR-regulated phosphoproteins were
      constructed using Pathway Studio 5.0 software, which includes canonical and novel
      EGFR-regulated proteins and implicates the possible biological roles for those
      proteins. Conclusion: The data not only can extend our knowledge of canonical
      EGFR signaling, but also will be useful to understand the molecular mechanisms of
      EGFR in NPC pathogenesis and search therapeutic targets for NPC.

AB  - An encouraging approach for the diagnosis and effective therapy of immunological 
      pathologies, which would include cancer, is the identification of proteins and
      phosphorylated proteins. Disease proteomics, in particular, is a potentially
      useful method for this purpose. A key role is played by protein phosphorylation
      in the regulation of normal immunology disorders and targets for several new
      cancer drugs and drug candidates are cancer cells and protein kinases. Protein
      phosphorylation is a highly dynamic process. The functioning of new drugs is of
      major importance as is the selection of those patients who would respond best to 
      a specific treatment regime. In all major aspects of cellular life signalling
      networks are key elements which play a major role in inter- and intracellular
      communications. They are involved in diverse processes such as cell-cycle
      progression, cellular metabolism, cell-cell communication and appropriate
      response to the cellular environment. A whole range of networks that are involved
      in the regulation of cell development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis,
      and immunologic responses is contained in the latter. It is so necessary to
      understand and monitor kinase signalling pathways in order to understand many
      immunology pathologies. Enrichment of phosphorylated proteins or peptides from
      tissue or bodily fluid samples is required. The application of technologies such 
      as immunoproteomic techniques, phosphoenrichments and mass spectrometry (MS) is
      crucial for the identification and quantification of protein phosphorylation
      sites in order to advance in clinical research. Pharmacodynamic readouts of
      disease states and cellular drug responses in tumour samples will be provided as 
      the field develops. We aim to detail the current and most useful techniques with 
      research examples to isolate and carry out clinical phosphoproteomic studies
      which may be helpful for immunology and cancer research. Different phosphopeptide
      enrichment and quantitative techniques need to be combined to achieve good
      phosphopeptide recovery and good up- and-down phospho-regulation protein studies.

TI  - Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid Treatment Reveals Crosstalks among Proteome,
      Ubiquitylome and Acetylome in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer A549 Cell Line.
LID - 9520
AB  - Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is a well-known histone deacetylase (HDAC)
      inhibitor and has been used as practical therapy for breast cancer and non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It is previously demonstrated that SAHA treatment could
      extensively change the profile of acetylome and proteome in cancer cells.
      However, little is known about the impact of SAHA on other protein modifications 
      and the crosstalks among different modifications and proteome, hindering the deep
      understanding of SAHA-mediated cancer therapy. In this work, by using SILAC
      technique, antibody-based affinity enrichment and high-resolution LC-MS/MS
      analysis, we investigated quantitative proteome, acetylome and ubiquitylome as
      well as crosstalks among the three datasets in A549 cells toward SAHA treatment. 
      In total, 2968 proteins, 1099 acetylation sites and 1012 ubiquitination sites
      were quantified in response to SAHA treatment, respectively. With the aid of
      intensive bioinformatics, we revealed that the proteome and ubiquitylome were
      negatively related upon SAHA treatment. Moreover, the impact of SAHA on acetylome
      resulted in 258 up-regulated and 99 down-regulated acetylation sites at the
      threshold of 1.5 folds. Finally, we identified 55 common sites with both
      acetylation and ubiquitination, among which ubiquitination level in 43 sites
      (78.2%) was positive related to acetylation level.

TI  - Interactome analysis of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α1 and -β1 in INS-1
      pancreatic beta-cells by affinity purification-mass spectrometry.
LID - 4376
AB  - The heterotrimeric enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a major
      metabolic factor that regulates the homeostasis of cellular energy. In
      particular, AMPK mediates the insulin resistance that is associated with type 2
      diabetes. Generally, cellular processes require tight regulation of protein
      kinases, which is effected through their formation of complex with other proteins
      and substrates. Despite their critical function in regulation and pathogenesis,
      there are limited data on the interaction of protein kinases. To identify
      proteins that interact with AMPK, we performed large-scale affinity purification 
      (AP)-mass spectrometry (MS) of the AMPK-α1 and -β1 subunits. Through a
      comprehensive analysis, using a combination of immunoprecipitaion and ion trap
      mass spectrometry, we identified 381 unique proteins in the AMPKα/β interactomes:
      325 partners of AMPK-α1 and 243 for AMPK-β1. Further, we identified 196 novel
      protein-protein interactions with AMPK-α1 and AMPK-β1. Notably, in our
      bioinformatics analysis, the novel interaction partners mediated functions that
      are related to the regulation of actin organization. Specifically, several such
      proteins were linked to pancreatic beta-cell functions, including
      glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, beta-cell development, beta-cell
      differentiation, and cell-cell communication.

TI  - The mutational landscape of phosphorylation signaling in cancer.
LID - 2651
AB  - Somatic mutations in cancer genomes include drivers that provide selective
      advantages to tumor cells and passengers present due to genome instability.
      Discovery of pan-cancer drivers will help characterize biological systems
      important in multiple cancers and lead to development of better therapies. Driver
      genes are most often identified by their recurrent mutations across tumor
      samples. However, some mutations are more important for protein function than
      others. Thus considering the location of mutations with respect to functional
      protein sites can predict their mechanisms of action and improve the sensitivity 
      of driver gene detection. Protein phosphorylation is a post-translational
      modification central to cancer biology and treatment, and frequently altered by
      driver mutations. Here we used our ActiveDriver method to analyze known
      phosphorylation sites mutated by single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in The Cancer 
      Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) pan-cancer dataset of 3,185 genomes and 12
      cancer types. Phosphorylation-related SNVs (pSNVs) occur in ~90% of tumors, show 
      increased conservation and functional mutation impact compared to other
      protein-coding mutations, and are enriched in cancer genes and pathways.
      Gene-centric analysis found 150 known and candidate cancer genes with significant
      pSNV recurrence. Using a novel computational method, we predict that 29% of these
      mutations directly abolish phosphorylation or modify kinase target sites to
      rewire signaling pathways. This analysis shows that incorporation of information 
      about protein signaling sites will improve computational pipelines for variant
      function prediction.

PG  - ra17
AB  - Adaptor proteins link surface receptors to intracellular signaling pathways, and 
      potentially control the way cells respond to nutrient availability. Mice
      deficient in p66Shc, the most-recently evolved isoform of the Shc1 adaptor
      proteins and a mediator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling display resistance 
      to diabetes and obesity. Using quantitative mass spectrometry, we found that
      p66Shc inhibited glucose metabolism. Depletion of p66Shc enhanced glycolysis and 
      increased the allocation of glucose-derived carbon into anabolic metabolism,
      characteristics of a metabolic shift called the Warburg effect. This change in
      metabolism was mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), because
      inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin reversed the glycolytic phenotype caused by
      p66Shc deficiency. Thus, unlike the other isoforms of Shc1, p66Shc appears to
      antagonize insulin and mTOR signaling, which limits glucose uptake and
      metabolism. Our results identify a critical inhibitory role for p66Shc in
      anabolic metabolism.

TI  - The Transcription Factor TFEB Links mTORC1 Signaling to Transcriptional Control
      of Lysosome Homeostasis.
PG  - ra42
AB  - Lysosomes are the major cellular site for clearance of defective organelles and
      digestion of internalized material. Demand on lysosomal capacity varies greatly, 
      but the mechanisms that adjust lysosomal function to maintain cellular
      homeostasis are unknown. In this study, we identify an interaction between mTOR
      and the TFEB transcription factor on the surface of lysosomes that allows mTOR to
      transduce signals arising from changes in lysosomal status to TFEB and thus
      control the ability of TFEB to enter the nucleus. This occurs via regulation of
      the serine 211 phosphorylation-dependent binding of 14-3-3 proteins to TFEB.
      These results identify TFEB as a novel target of mTOR that couples the
      transcriptional regulation of genes encoding proteins of autophagosomes and
      lysosomes to cellular need. We further present evidence that the closely related 
      MITF and TFE3 transcription factors are regulated in a similar manner, thus
      broadening the range of physiological contexts under which such regulation may
      prove important.

TI  - Global Phosphoproteomics Reveals Crosstalk between Bcr-Abl and Negative Feedback 
      Mechanisms Controlling Src Signaling.
PG  - ra18
AB  - In subtypes and late stages of leukemias driven by the tyrosine kinase fusion
      protein Bcr-Abl, Src signaling critically contributes to the leukemic phenotype. 
      We performed global tyrosine phosphoprofiling using quantitative mass
      spectrometry of Bcr-Abl transformed cells in which the activities of the Src
      family kinases (SFKs) were perturbed to build a detailed context-dependent
      network of cancer signaling. Perturbation of the SFKs Lyn and Hck with genetics
      or inhibitors revealed Bcr-Abl downstream phosphorylation events either mediated 
      by or independent of SFKs. We identified multiple negative feedback mechanisms
      within the network of signaling events affected by Bcr-Abl and SFKs, and found
      that Bcr-Abl attenuated these inhibitory mechanisms. The Csk binding protein Pag1
      (also known as Cbp) and the tyrosine phosphatase Ptpn18 both mediated negative
      feedback to SFKs. We observed Bcr-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of the phosphatase
      Shp2 (Ptpn11) and this may contribute to the suppression of these negative
      feedback mechanisms to promote Bcr-Abl-activated SFK signaling. Csk and a
      kinase-deficient Csk mutant both produced similar globally repressive signaling
      consequences, suggesting a critical role for the adaptor protein function of Csk 
      in its inhibition of Bcr-Abl and SFK signaling. The identified Bcr-Abl-activated 
      SFK regulatory mechanisms are candidates for dysregulation during leukemia
      progression and acquisition of SFK-mediated drug resistance.

TI  - ABL Tyrosine Kinases: Evolution of Function, Regulation, and Specificity*.
PG  - re6
AB  - ABL-family proteins comprise one of the best conserved branches of the tyrosine
      kinases. Each ABL protein contains an SH3-SH2-TK (Src homology 3–Src homology
      2–tyrosine kinase) domain cassette, which confers autoregulated kinase activity
      and is common among nonreceptor tyrosine kinases. This cassette is coupled to an 
      actin-binding and -bundling domain, which makes ABL proteins capable of
      connecting phosphoregulation with actin-filament reorganization. Two vertebrate
      paralogs, ABL1 and ABL2, have evolved to perform specialized functions. ABL1
      includes nuclear localization signals and a DNA binding domain through which it
      mediates DNA damage-repair functions, whereas ABL2 has additional binding
      capacity for actin and for microtubules to enhance its cytoskeletal remodeling
      functions. Several types of posttranslational modifications control ABL catalytic
      activity, subcellular localization, and stability, with consequences for both
      cytoplasmic and nuclear ABL functions. Binding partners provide additional
      regulation of ABL catalytic activity, substrate specificity, and downstream
      signaling. Information on ABL regulatory mechanisms is being mined to provide new
      therapeutic strategies against hematopoietic malignancies caused by BCR-ABL1 and 
      related leukemogenic proteins.

TI  - Akt-RSK-S6-kinase Signaling Networks Activated by Oncogenic Receptor Tyrosine
      Kinases.
PG  - ra64
AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activate pathways mediated by serine/threonine
      (Ser/Thr) kinases such as the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)-Akt pathway,
      the Ras-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-RSK pathway, and the mTOR
      (mammalian target of rapamycin)-p70 S6 pathway that control important aspects of 
      cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The Akt, RSK, and p70 S6 family of
      protein kinases transmit signals by phosphorylating substrates on a RxRxxS/T
      motif. Here, we developed a large-scale proteomic approach to identify over 200
      substrates of this kinase family in cancer cell lines driven by the c-Met,
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), or platelet-derived growth factor
      receptor a (PDGFRα) RTKs. We identified a subset of proteins with RxRxxS/T sites 
      for which phosphorylation was decreased by RTKIs as well as by inhibitors of the 
      PI3K, mTOR, and MAPK pathways and determined the effects of siRNA directed
      against these substrates on cell viability. We found that phosphorylation of the 
      protein chaperone SGTA (small glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat-containing 
      protein alpha) at Ser305 is essential for PDGFRα stabilization and cell survival 
      in PDGFRα-dependent cancer cells. Our approach provides a new view of RTK and
      Akt-RSK-S6 kinase signaling, revealing many previously unidentified Akt-RSK-S6
      kinase substrates that merit further consideration as targets for combination
      therapy with RTKIs.

TI  - Signaling to Transcription Networks in the Neuronal Retrograde Injury Response.
PG  - ra53
AB  - Retrograde signaling from axon to soma activates intrinsic regeneration
      mechanisms in lesioned peripheral sensory neurons; however, the links between
      axonal injury signaling and the cell body response are not well understood. Here,
      we used phosphoproteomics and microarrays to implicate ~900 phosphoproteins in
      retrograde injury signaling in rat sciatic nerve axons in vivo and ~4500
      transcripts in the in vivo response to injury in the dorsal root ganglia.
      Computational analyses of these data sets identified ~400 redundant axonal
      signaling networks connected to 39 transcription factors implicated in the
      sensory neuron response to axonal injury. Experimental perturbation of individual
      overrepresented signaling hub proteins, including Abl, AKT, p38, and protein
      kinase C, affected neurite outgrowth in sensory neurons. Paradoxically, however, 
      combined perturbation of Abl together with other hub proteins had a reduced
      effect relative to perturbation of individual proteins. Our data indicate that
      nerve injury responses are controlled by multiple regulatory components, and
      suggest that network redundancies provide robustness to the injury response.

TI  - Imatinib and Dasatinib Inhibit Hemangiosarcoma and Implicate PDGFR-β and Src in
      Tumor Growth12.
PG  - 158-68
AB  - Hemangiosarcoma, a natural model of human angiosarcoma, is an aggressive vascular
      tumor diagnosed commonly in dogs. The documented expression of several receptor
      tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by these tumors makes them attractive targets for
      therapeutic intervention using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, we
      possess limited knowledge of the effects of TKIs on hemangiosarcoma as well as
      other soft tissue sarcomas. We report here on the use of the TKIs imatinib and
      dasatinib in canine hemangiosarcoma and their effects on platelet-derived growth 
      factor receptor β (PDGFR-β) and Src inhibition. Both TKIs reduced cell viability,
      but dasatinib was markedly more potent in this regard, mediating cytotoxic
      effects orders of magnitude greater than imatinib. Dasatinib also inhibited the
      phosphorylation of the shared PDGFR-β target at a concentration approximately
      1000 times less than that needed by imatinib and effectively blocked Src
      phosphorylation. Both inhibitors augmented the response to doxorubicin,
      suggesting that clinical responses likely will be improved using both drugs in
      combination; however, dasatinib was significantly (P < .05) more effective in
      this context. Despite the higher concentrations needed in cell-based assays,
      imatinib significantly inhibited tumor growth (P < .05) in a tumor xenograft
      model, highlighting that disruption of PDGFR-β/PDGF signaling may be important in
      targeting the angiogenic nature of these tumors. Treatment of a dog with
      spontaneously occurring hemangiosarcoma established that clinically achievable
      doses of dasatinib may be realized in dogs and provides a means to investigate
      the effect of TKIs on soft tissue sarcomas in a large animal model.

TI  - STAT-Related Profiles Are Associated with Patient Response to Targeted Treatments
      in Locally Advanced SCCHN1.
PG  - 47-58
AB  - The anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab (Erbitux, CTX) is
      currently used for the treatment of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of
      the head and neck (LA-SCCHN), as yet with modest effectiveness, prompting for the
      identification of response predictors to this treatment and for the targeting of 
      additional pathways implicated in this disease. Within this scope, we
      investigated the effect of SRC/STAT pathway components on LA-SCCHN patient
      outcome. SRC, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, ANXA1, CAV1, IGFBP2, EPHA2, EPHB2,
      and MSN relative gene expression, as well as Stat protein activation, were
      assessed on LA-SCCHN tumor tissues from 35 patients treated with combined
      radiotherapy (RT) and CTX-based regimens. Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 proteins were
      usually found activated in neoplastic nuclei (70.4%, 85.7%, and 70.8%,
      respectively). Activated Stat3 and Stat5 were associated with each other (P =
      .017) and with a CAV1high/MSNhigh/IGFBP2low profile. All patients with tumors
      expressing high STAT5A/EPHA2 experienced a complete response on RT-CTX-based
      treatments (12/15 complete responders, P < .0001) and a longer progression-free
      survival (P = .024). Few tumors expressed high ANXA1/CAV1/EPHA2 and low IGFBP2, a
      putative dasatinib response-related profile, whereas high ANXA1 was associated
      with shorter overall survival (P = .003). In conclusion, Stat activation is
      common in LA-SCCHN, where overexpression of STAT5A and EPHA2 may predict for
      response to RT-CTX treatments. The STAT5A/EPHA2 profile seems of particular
      interest for validation in larger cohorts and in multiple tumor types because
      markers for the positive selection of patients to benefit from CTX-containing
      treatments are currently lacking.

PG  - 3192-212
AB  - As viruses do not possess genes encoding for proteins required for translation,
      energy metabolism or membrane biosynthesis, they are classified as obligatory
      intracellular parasites that depend on a host cell to replicate. This genome
      limitation forces them to gain control over cellular processes to ensure their
      successful propagation. A diverse spectrum of virally encoded proteins tackling a
      broad spectrum of cellular pathways during most steps of the viral life cycle
      ranging from the host cell entry to viral protein translation has evolved. Since 
      the host cell PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays a critical regulatory role in many
      cellular processes including RNA processing, translation, autophagy and
      apoptosis, many viruses, in widely varying ways, target it. This review focuses
      on a number of remarkable examples of viral strategies, which exploit the
      PI3K/Akt signaling pathway for effective viral replication.

TI  - Systems biology approaches to understanding Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition
      (EMT) in mucosal remodeling and signaling in asthma.
PG  - 13
AB  - A pathological hallmark of asthma is chronic injury and repair, producing
      dysfunction of the epithelial barrier function. In this setting, increased
      oxidative stress, growth factor- and cytokine stimulation, together with
      extracellular matrix contact produces transcriptional reprogramming of the
      epithelial cell. This process results in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
      a cellular state associated with loss of epithelial polarity, expression of
      mesenchymal markers, enhanced mobility and extracellular matrix remodeling. As a 
      result, the cellular biology of the EMT state produces characteristic changes
      seen in severe, refractory asthma: myofibroblast expansion, epithelial
      trans-differentiation and subepithelial fibrosis. EMT also induces profound
      changes in epithelial responsiveness that affects innate immune signaling that
      may have impact on the adaptive immune response and effectiveness of
      glucocorticoid therapy in severe asthma. We discuss how this complex phenotype is
      beginning to be understood using systems biology-level approaches through
      perturbations coupled with high throughput profiling and computational modeling. 
      Understanding the distinct changes induced by EMT at the systems level may
      provide translational strategies to reverse the altered signaling and physiology 
      of refractory asthma.
